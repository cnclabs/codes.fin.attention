item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a  risk factors 
the following discussion takes into consideration our acquisition of mobile storage group on june  the operations of mobile storage group are included in our operating results for only six months of the twelve months ended december  additionally  the results of operations for also include four additional acquisitions and one start up location that we completed in  in  the results of operations include four acquisitions beyond mobile storage group we completed during 
table of contents executive summary was a transformational year for mobile mini as we acquired our largest competitor  mobile storage group  which contributed to increasing total revenues to million from million 
in addition  we were cash flow positive after capital expenditures but excluding acquisitions for the first time in our operating history 
since closing the acquisition  we believe we have been achieving the economic benefits of the msg integration sooner than anticipated  particularly through a reduction in overhead and infrastructure costs as previously overlapping locations in both the us and the us have been combined 
in addition  we enacted a selective price increase in the third quarter of  focusing on customers who have had units out on rent for an extended period of time 
to date  the attrition rates for the affected customers have been the same or less than other customers 
in addition  although fuel costs came down in the fourth quarter of  they were at their highest levels during much of the third quarter 
where possible  we recouped some of those costs by imposing a fuel surcharge in the us in the second quarter of and in the us in september the recession and credit crisis in the us and us have curtailed non residential construction activity and we expect these factors to continue to negatively affect our revenues in as a result  in late and early  we made reductions in non essential expenses  most notably by reducing headcount 
in the fourth quarter of  we restructured our manufacturing operations to reduce costs and implemented two rounds of company wide reductions  which together resulted in reductions of approximately employees 
we continually monitor activity levels through a variety of metrics we use to find efficiencies in the number of drivers  dispatchers  managers  salespeople and corporate staff needed in the evolving business environment 
as a result  we may continue to reduce headcount in areas where we believe we can find efficiencies without reducing customer service and sales activity levels 
we believe these efforts  coupled with only nominal fleet purchases and maintenance expense  will allow us to continue to generate free cash flow in and pay down debt  which remains a top corporate priority 
since the mobile storage group transaction  we have reduced borrowings under our million asset based revolving credit facility from million at june  to million at december   leaving us with million of unused borrowing capacity under our facility 
our senior notes do not contain financial maintenance covenants and the financial maintenance covenants under our revolving credit facility are not applicable unless we fall below million in borrowing availability 
at the same time we are reducing costs  we are increasing our internal efforts on sales growth to our core customers and have refocused our efforts to gain business through government projects at the federal  state and local levels 
we are doing this in part through increasing salesperson accountability through our disciplined sales processes which we believe has traditionally given us a significant competitive advantage 
general in addition to our leasing business  we also sell portable storage containers and occasionally sell mobile office units 
our sales revenues as a percentage of total revenues represented of revenues in on june   we acquired the outstanding shares of mobile storage group through a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of mobile mini into mobile storage group s ultimate parent  msg wc holdings corp 
immediately thereafter  each of msg wc holdings corp 
and two of its direct subsidiaries merged with and into mobile mini and mobile storage group became a wholly owned subsidiary of mobile mini 
we refer to this transaction as the merger throughout this document 
the merger was the largest acquisition we have completed and it increased the scope of our operations in both the us and the us our consolidated statements of income for the reporting period ended december   include certain estimated expenses expected to be incurred related to integration of the business acquired in the merger and a restructuring charge related to restructuring of our manufacturing operations as a result of the merger 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the merger 

table of contents prior to acquiring msg  mobile mini grew through both organic growth and smaller acquisitions  which we use to gain a presence in new markets 
typically  we enter a new market through the acquisition of the business of a smaller local competitor and then apply our business model  which is usually much more customer service and marketing focused than the business we are buying or its competitors in the market 
if we cannot find a desirable acquisition opportunity in a market we wish to enter  we establish a new location from the ground up 
as a result  a new branch location will typically have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as our marketing efforts help us penetrate the new market and we increase the number of units on rent at the new branch  we take advantage of operating efficiencies to improve operating margins at the branch and typically reach company average levels after several years 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing an infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum levels of staffing and delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we generate high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit rented in excess of the break even level  contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  additional fixed expenses that we incur require us to achieve additional revenue as compared to the prior period to cover the additional expense 
as a result of the merger  we have been implementing our business model across the newly acquired msg branches 
while we have been able to realize significant cost reductions as a result of the combination of two companies  there may yet be inefficiencies or additional fixed costs that put pressure on operating margins as we fully integrate the two companies 
among the external factors we examine to determine the direction of our business is the level of non residential construction activity 
customers in the construction industry represented approximately and of our units on rent at december  and  respectively  and because of the degree of operating leverage we have  increases or decreases in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
in  after three years of very strong growth in non residential construction activity in the u 
s  the growth rate in this sector began to moderate and the level of our construction related business began to slow down and then decline 
this decline continues to adversely affect our results of operations into in managing our business  we focus on growing leasing revenues  particularly in existing markets where we can take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
mobile mini s goal is to maintain a stable growth rate 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  debt restructuring or extinguishment expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into and this measure provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to ignore the effect of what we consider non recurring events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as adjusted ebitda 
although not presented in this annual report for  adjusted ebitda does not include the integration  merger and restructuring expenses related to the msg acquisition and a goodwill impairment charge related to the uk and the netherlands 
in managing our business  we routinely compare our ebitda margins from year to year and based upon age of branch 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the startup costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our high operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in 
table of contents profitability 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 
because ebitda and ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures  as defined by the sec  we include in this annual report reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these reconciliations are included in item  selected financial data 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage  combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units and mobile offices in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  remanufacture and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include among other expenses  advertising and other marketing expenses  real property lease expenses  commissions  repair and maintenance costs of our lease fleet and transportation equipment and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
the steel units in our lease fleet other than van trailers are depreciated on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
we also have other non core products that are added to our fleet as a result of acquisitions that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
see item business product lives and durability 
during the last five years  our annual utilization levels averaged  and ranged from a low of in to a high of in our utilization level averaged during since  we have increased our total lease fleet from  units to approximately  units  representing a cagr of 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of income  certain amounts may not add due to rounding year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses integration  merger and restructuring expense goodwill impairment depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income other income interest expense debt extinguishment expense foreign currency exchange gains loss income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing  our primary revenue focus  accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase in revenues resulted from a increase in the average number of units on lease  offset by a decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and virtually no change in average rental yield per unit price 
in  our leasing revenue growth rate was as compared to in the increased growth rate in is due to the merger 
this was offset in part by a reduction in business activity in from its level due to a decline in non residential construction activity and the economic recession 
our leasing revenue growth rate in over the same period in the prior year was    and for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
our leasing revenues would have declined in the third and fourth quarters of without the msg merger 
as a result of the merger  we added new branches in branches in the us and in the us we also completed four smaller acquisitions in  three where we combined acquired businesses in cities in which we already had existing operations and one in hartford  connecticut 
our sales of units accounted for of total revenues in both and our revenues from the sale of units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is related to the higher level of sales activity at our newer locations both in the us and in the us attributable to locations added as a result of the msg merger 
other revenues  primarily related to our sales business and principally arising from transportation charges for the delivery 
table of contents of units sold and the sale of ancillary products  represented approximately of total revenues in and in cost of sales are the costs related to our sales revenue only 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue decreased slightly to in from in leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
this decrease as a percentage of revenues is due to the operating leverage associated with our leasing activities and in part  due to cost saving synergies related to the merger that we realized during the last two quarters of the increase in of million is primarily the result of the merger  as the majority of our leasing  selling and general expenses increase occurred during the third and fourth quarters 
in  our expenses included the costs associated with developing infrastructure to support our europe operations as a result of implementing our leasing business model for the operations we acquired in these fixed costs  for the most part  continued into included in leasing  selling and general expense is approximately million and million in and  respectively  of expenses related to share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the major increases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were payroll and related payroll costs  which increased by million primarily in connection with the additional locations such as staffing for branch managers  sales and office personnel and yard personnel  including drivers  fork lift operators and dispatchers  delivery and freight costs  including fuel  which increased million related to picking up and delivery of containers  including the additional trucks we added at the new locations  and building and land lease costs for our locations  which increased million  including the assumption of leases utilized by the locations added in the merger and contractual rate increases at existing and new locations 
the increased delivery and freight costs includes the higher cost of fuel  primarily during the first three quarters of  and for more third party vendors which were used for the delivery of our units  mainly wood modular offices 
part of the increased costs was passed to our customers in the form of higher trucking rates 
integration  merger and restructuring expenses in represent estimated costs for exiting targeted mobile mini branch operations that overlapped with mobile storage group s properties  repositioning and relocating assets to their intended location  and other costs associated with personnel and office expenses associated with the integration of the companies 
also included in this expense is our estimated cost for restructuring our manufacturing operations and includes severance  related benefit costs and asset impairment charges for the disposal of manufacturing equipment and inventories that will not be used in the restructured environment 
goodwill impairment in represents a non cash charge for a portion of our goodwill related to our uk and the netherlands operations as more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
ebitda increased million  or  to million in from million in ebitda in includes integration  merger and restructuring expenses of million and a charge for goodwill impairment of million  both as described above 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation expense is primarily due to the increase in our lease fleet over the prior year including the depreciation of units acquired through acquisitions 
it also includes the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
also  in and  depreciation expense includes the related depreciation on the additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily trucks  forklifts and trailers  to support the lease fleet  and the customized erp system to enhance our reporting environment 
in  depreciation and amortization expense includes the amortization of customer relationships and trade name valuation that were associated with the msg merger 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased by million 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to the million of debt we assumed in the merger 
although we assumed mobile storage s million of senior notes and the interest rate spread under our revolving credit facility 
table of contents increased from libor to libor  our average borrowing rate declined slightly in  due to lower prevailing libor rates 
the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for compared to for  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was in and in debt extinguishment expense for resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs and the redemption premium on million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes redeemed in the second quarter of provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for as compared to an annual effective tax rate of for our consolidated tax provision includes the expected tax rates for our operations in the us  canada  us and the netherlands 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
net income in was million  as compared to million in our net income results were primarily achieved by our increase in revenues and the operating leverage associated with this growth and synergies achieved in the last six months of as a result of the merger 
the year was negatively affected by the million million after tax  charge related to the integration  merger and restructuring expense in addition to million after tax charge for goodwill impairment 
in  net income was unfavorably affected by the million  million after tax charge for debt extinguishment expense related to the redemption of our then outstanding senior notes 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing  our primary focus  accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from a increase in the average rental yield per unit  a increase in the average number of units on lease and increase due to favorable exchange rates  in each case as compared to the same period in the increase in revenues resulted from an increase in average rental rates over the prior year  an increase in revenue for ancillary rental services  such as delivery charges and continued change in the mix of units being added to our fleet 
we have added more premium containers and portable wood offices to the lease fleet in recent periods for which we obtain higher rental rates than basic storage units 
the mobile offices we have added to our lease fleet in recent quarters have on average been larger units that command higher rents 
these higher lease rates were partially offset by lower rental rates on units added through acquisitions that continue on lease  including europe  which on the average are smaller  were not remanufactured and were primarily storage containers rather than mobile offices 
in  our leasing revenue growth rate was as compared to in the leasing revenue growth rate during the four quarters of was   and  respectively 
the fourth quarter growth rate was negatively impacted by several factors  including the general slowdown in non residential construction during the second half of and a planned significant reduction in our seasonal storage business compared to levels 
we opened four new branches in two new locations in the us and two in canada 
we also completed another acquisition in in which we consolidated the acquired business operations into our existing pensacola  florida operations 
our sales of units accounted for in and in  of our total revenues 
other revenues  primarily related to our sales business and principally arising from transportation charges for the delivery of units sold and the sale of ancillary products represented of total revenues in and in our revenues from the sale of units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily related to the higher level of sales activity at our newer locations both in the us and especially in europe which only had eight months reported in cost of sales are the costs related to our sales revenue only 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue increased to in from in the decrease in the gross margin results in large part from the 
table of contents additional sales associated with our european operations where many of our units are sold at wholesale and sales margins tend to be lower than in the us leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
in  our margins were affected by the costs associated with developing infrastructure to support our uk operations  higher delivery and freight costs  employee stock based compensation expense  higher fleet repair and maintenance expense  and expenses that vary in relation to revenue growth 
we generally anticipate that a new branch will first achieve a positive operating margin after approximately months of operations 
in the uk  this ramp up was more pronounced than our historical experience  because the operating model of our predecessor featured outsourced storage yards and third party delivery equipment 
consequently we needed to acquire properties from which to operate our branches  delivery equipment with which to operate our business  and sales employees to drive demand for our products 
during  delivery and freight costs  including fuel  increased by million over  as fuel prices increased and we used more third party vendors for the transportation of our units  particularly our modular office units increased costs were passed on to customers in the form of higher delivery and pick up charges 
included in leasing  selling and general expense is approximately million and million in and  respectively  of expenses related to share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which became effective for us on january  in addition  the other major increases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were repairs on our lease fleet  including costs related to our office units  increased by million due to costs associated with repairing hurricane damaged units and a larger number of mobile offices maintaining our higher overall utilization and repairs and maintenance of delivery and other equipment increased by million principally as a result of our preventative maintenance programs and general repairs associated with servicing a larger lease fleet and payroll and related expenses increased by million and included increased commissions paid on increased revenues as well as general wage increases 
ebitda increased million  or  to million in from million in depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the higher depreciation expense is primarily due to the growth in our lease fleet over the prior year to meet increased demand of our products and included the depreciation of units acquired through acquisitions in both and it also includes the depreciation expenses associated with the portable storage units added to the lease fleet during and the inclusion in the lease fleet of additional wood modular offices which have a higher depreciation rate than our steel units 
also  in and  depreciation expense includes the related depreciation on the additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily trucks  forklifts and trailers  to support the lease fleet growth  and the customized enterprise resource planning system to enhance our reporting environment 
this increase in our lease fleet enabled us to achieve our higher lease revenues 
since december   our lease fleet cost basis for depreciation increased by million 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments within this item interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in our monthly weighted average debt outstanding during  compared to  increased while our average borrowing rate declined slightly in  compared to the prior year level 
in  we redeemed million of our senior notes and issued million of senior notes  that were issued at of par 
in  we paid down million of our higher interest rate senior notes 
during  we invested million in net additions to our lease fleet and million in acquisitions 
these additions were funded through cash flow from operations and additional borrowings 
the monthly weighted average interest rate on our debt was for compared to for  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the monthly weighted average interest rate was in and in our weighted average interest rate is lower  in part  because we redeemed our higher interest rate senior notes in may see liquidity and capital resources within this item debt extinguishment expense for the period resulted from the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs and the redemption premium on million aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes redeemed in the second quarter of for the period  this expense represents the portion

the tax provision includes a million tax benefit due to the recognition of certain state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously scheduled to expire in at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused from to in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate 
we believe  based on internal projections  that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet 
net income in was million  as compared to million in our net income results were primarily achieved by our increase in revenues and the operating leverage associated with this growth 
these increases were partially offset by the million  million after tax  charge for debt extinguishment expense related to the redemption of our outstanding senior notes 
our net income was partially offset by the million million after tax  tax debt extinguishment expenses related to the partial redemption of our senor notes and includes a million tax benefit due to the expected recognition of certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary leasing is a capital intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets which we lease have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products we offer 
during recent years  our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre tax earnings  particularly due to the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation that is used for tax accounting 
in  we were cash flow positive after capital expenditures but excluding acquisitions for the first time in our operating history 
during the past three years  our capital expenditures and acquisitions have been funded by our operating cash flow  our offering of shares of our common stock in march which provided us approximately million of net proceeds  our may offering of senior notes which provided us approximately million of net proceeds  and through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating cash flow is generally weakest during the first quarter of each fiscal year  when customers who leased containers for holiday storage return the units 
during  we cut back significantly on our capital expenditures and were able to fund the growth of our lease fleet and fixed assets required to support our operations with cash provided by operating activities 
we expect this trend to continue in in addition to cash flow generated by operations  our principal current source of liquidity is our revolving credit facility described below 
revolving credit facility 
in connection with the merger  we expanded our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing limit and to include the combined assets of both mobile mini and mobile storage group as security for the facility 
on june   we entered into an abl credit agreement the credit agreement with deutsche bank ag new york branch and the other lenders party thereto 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are due on june  amounts borrowed under the credit agreement and repaid or prepaid during the term may be reborrowed 
the obligations of mobile mini and our subsidiary guarantors under the credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets 
as of december   borrowings outstanding under our credit facility were approximately million and we had million of additional borrowing availability under the credit agreement  based upon borrowing base calculations as of such date 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we were in compliance 
table of contents with all the covenants as of december  see financing activities below for more information abut our revolving credit facility 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in as compared to million in and million in the million increase in over in cash provided by operating activities  included a increase of million related to depreciation and amortization  million for non cash goodwill impairment charges  a million non cash expense for the restructuring of our manufacturing operations and an increase of million for provisions for doubtful accounts partially offset by pre tax income decrease of million 
additionally  in  there were decreases in both inventories and deposits and prepaid expenses providing positive cash flows which were offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
these were all primarily a result of the merger and the decrease in purchases of inventories due to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in late in  cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by debt restructuring expense which included a million premium paid in connection with redeeming million of our senior notes 
in  cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by increases in accounts receivable which was due to the general growth in our leasing activities by an increase in our sales activity related to our newly acquired european operations  and by an increase in deposits and prepaid expenses 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a net deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  million of cash was paid for acquisition of businesses  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  were million in  million in and million in our net capital expenditures for our lease fleet decreased almost in  as we were able to obtain most of the units we needed to support our growth through the transaction with msg and we required fewer units due to decreased demand as a result of the economic slow down 
additions to the lease fleet included remanufacturing of prior acquisition units and manufactured or purchased steel and wood offices 
during the past several years we have increased the customization of our fleet  enabling us to differentiate our product from our competitors product  and we have complimented our lease fleet by adding wood mobile offices 
at the end of  we restructured our manufacturing operations to right size our future manufacturing requirements considering the large lease fleet we acquired in the msg transaction 
with the current economic conditions  we anticipate our near term investing activities will be primarily focused on remanufacturing units acquired in acquisitions to meet our lease fleet standards as these units are placed on rent 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from any sale of property  plant and equipment  were million in  million in and million in expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were primarily for technology and communication improvements for our telephone and computer systems and for delivery equipment at new locations acquired through the merger 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
we have no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
maintenance capital expenditures is the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for enhancements to our computer information and communication systems 
our maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million in  primarily upgrades and improvements to our communication equipment  million in both and financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and net cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in in  we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million which we used primarily to fund the merger  as well as other related expenses and costs associated with our credit agreement 
in connection with the merger we also assumed debt obligations  some requiring monthly installment payments 
in  we redeemed million principal amount of outstanding senior notes and completed an offering of million principal amount senior notes 
also in  under a common stock repurchase program  we redeemed million of our outstanding shares 
additionally  we received million  million and million from the exercises 
table of contents of employee stock options and the related tax benefits in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under the facility 
outstanding amounts under our credit agreement bear interest at our option at either i libor plus a defined margin  or ii the agent lender bank s prime rate plus a margin 
libor loans will initially bear interest at libor plus and prime rate loans will initially bear interest at the agent lender bank s prime rate plus 
after the quarter ended june   the applicable margins for each type of loan will range from to for libor loans and to for prime rate loans depending upon our debt ratio at the measurement date 
availability of borrowings under the credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable  eligible container fleet including containers held for sale  work in process and raw materials  machinery and equipment and real property  each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit 
at december   we had million in additional borrowing availability under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for uk borrowings  denominated in either pounds sterling or euros  by our subsidiary mobile mini uk limited based upon a uk borrowing base  and our uk borrowings  denominated in dollars  are based upon a us and canada borrowing base 
the credit agreement does contain certain financial maintenance covenants  but these maintenance covenants are not applicable unless we have less than million in borrowing availability under the facility 
at december   we had approximately million of availability 
the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries  including covenants that restrict their ability to  among other things  i make capital expenditures in excess of defined limits  ii allow certain liens to attach to us or our subsidiary assets  iii repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on capital stock and certain other securities  or prepay certain indebtedness  iv incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions  and v make acquisitions or other investments 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  in connection with the merger  we paid down the outstanding balances of our and mobile storage group s then existing revolving credit facilities 
we financed these pay downs through a borrowing at closing under the abl credit agreement 
we evaluated the expansion of our own revolving credit facility under the provisions of eitf  debtor s accounting for changes in line of credit or revolving debt arrangements  and as the new borrowing capacity under the credit agreement exceeds that under our original revolving credit facility  unamortized deferred financing costs have been added to the costs incurred as part of the credit agreement 
we believe we have sufficient borrowings available under our revolving credit facility to provide for our normal capital needs for the next months 
we monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an on going basis using publicly available information 
based upon that information  we do not presently think that there is a likelihood that any of our lenders might not be able to honor its commitments under the credit agreement 
preferred stock 
on june   as part of the consideration for the acquisition of mobile storage group  we issued million shares of our series a convertible redeemable participating preferred stock to the former stockholders of mobile storage group 
the shares were determined to have an initial fair value of million based upon a third party valuation

hedging activities 
at december   we had eight interest rate swap agreements in place to fix interest rates paid on a total of million of our outstanding debt 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the interest rate so that the rate is payable based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
at december   million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates or the rate is effectively fixed due to a swap agreement  and approximately million of borrowings under our credit facility are variable rate 
accounting for these swap agreements is covered by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and million of senior notes  together with other  primarily unsecured notes payable obligations  and obligations under capital leases 
we also have operating lease commitments for real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms typically ranging from to years  delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price  and forklifts and office related equipment 
at december   primarily in connection with the issuance of our insurance policies  we provided certain insurance carriers and others with approximately million in letters of credit 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments 
historically  we enter into capitalized lease obligations from time to time to purchase delivery  transportation and yard equipment and currently  as a result of the merger  have commitments for million in capital lease obligations 

table of contents the table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  the operating lease amounts include certain real estate leases that expire in  but have lease renewal options that we currently anticipate to exercise in at the end of the initial lease period

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventories 
table of contents for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this causes lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the year 
over the last few years  we have tried to reduce the percentage of our units we reserve for this seasonal business from the levels we allocated in earlier years  decreasing our seasonality 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
mobile mini s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage units and office units are recognized on a straight line basis 
revenues and expenses from portable storage unit delivery and hauling are recognized when these services are earned  in accordance with sab no 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers and mobile office units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell our products pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price with our customers 
share based compensation 
prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of income 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line attribution method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using accelerated attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share awards at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against 
table of contents estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts agings 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share at december  as follows years ended december  in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for hypothetical change in reserve estimates net income diluted earnings per share if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we operate on one reportable segment  which is comprised of three reporting units north america  uk and the netherlands 
all of our goodwill was allocated between these three reporting units 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill at december using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in addition  we will perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have incurred 
at december   we performed the first step of the two step impairment test and compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units  we considered both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of companies comparable to the reporting unit being valued 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures and discount rates 
each approach was given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit 
we determined the fair values of the uk and the netherlands reporting units were less than the carrying values of the net assets of these reporting units  thus we performed step two of the impairment test for these two reporting units 
in step two of the impairment test  we are required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
we allocated the fair value of the reporting units to the respective assets and liabilities of each reporting unit as if the reporting units had been acquired in separate and individual business combinations and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting units 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting units over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
for both reporting units in the step two testing  the implied value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill  resulting in an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of we reconciled the fair values of our three reporting units in the aggregate to our market capitalization at december  
table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
we have other non core products that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
van trailers and other non core products are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect being determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life on our steel units would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted earnings per share as reflected in the table below 
useful residual life in value years in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted earnings per share insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance are purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we provide for the estimated expense relating to the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies  and  at year end  the accrual is reviewed and 
table of contents adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable as that term is defined in sfas no 
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 
deferred taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination 
at december   we have a million valuation allowance and have million of deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet 
the majority of the deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates 
management currently believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations and  or through available tax planning strategies to recover these assets 
however  given that these federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over years beginning in  there could be changes in management s judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets 
as of december   management believes that it is more likely than not that the unreserved portion of these deferred tax assets will be recovered

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we use to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had eight interest rate swap agreements under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable interest rate on million of debt 
in  in accordance with sfas no 
 comprehensive income included a charge of million  net of income tax benefit of million  related to the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes

we currently have branch operations outside the us and we bill those customers primarily in their local currency which is subject to foreign currency rate changes 
our operations in canada are billed in the canadian dollar  operations in the uk are billed in pound sterling and operations in the netherlands are billed in the euro 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our non us operations are translated into us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has historically been insignificant with our canadian operations  but we have more exposure to volatility with our european operations 
in order to help minimize our exchange rate gain and loss volatility  we finance our european entities through our revolving line of credit which allows us to also borrow those funds in pound sterling denominated debt
