background and significant acquisitions we were incorporated in delaware on october  in order to serve as a vehicle to effect a business combination with one or more operating businesses in the rental services and specialty finance sectors 
from inception through september   we did not have any business or operations and our activities were limited to raising capital in our initial public offering the ipo in april  identifying an operating business to acquire  and negotiating and entering into an agreement to acquire royal wolf 

table of contents on september  september in australia  we completed the acquisition of royal wolf through the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of rwa 
royal wolf is the leading provider in australia and new zealand of storage containers  portable container buildings and freight containers  which we refer to collectively as storage container products 
based upon the actual exchange rate of one australian dollar to us dollar realized in connection with payments made upon completion of the acquisition  the purchase price paid to the sellers for the rwa shares was million  including deposits of  previously paid by us in connection with the acquisition 
we paid the purchase price  less the deposits  by a combination of cash in the amount of million plus the issuance to bison capital australia  lp bison capital  one of the sellers  of shares of common stock of gfn us  and the issuance of a note to bison capital 
as a result of this structure  we own of the outstanding capital stock of gfn us and bison capital owns of the outstanding capital stock of gfn u 
s  which through its indirect subsidiary gfn finance owns all of the outstanding capital stock of royal wolf 
all references to events or activities other than equity related which occurred prior to the completion of the acquisition on september  september in australia relate to royal wolf  as the predecessor company the predecessor 
all references to events or activities other than equity related which occurred after the completion of the acquisition on september  september in australia relate to us  as the successor company the successor 
on october   we completed our acquisition of pac van through a merger with mobile office acquisition corp 
moac  the parent of pac van  and our wholly owned subsidiary formed in july  gfnna 
pac van leases and sells modular buildings  mobile offices and storage container products in the united states 
in addition to assuming pac van s long term debt  we paid the purchase price to the stockholders of moac by a combination of million in cash   shares of gfn restricted common stock and a month subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of million bearing interest at per annum 
the note and  shares of our restricted common stock will secure the indemnification obligations for months and months  respectively 
among other things  we and the stockholders of moac entered into a stockholders agreement which provided registration rights which may be exercised after june  business overview the global economic downturn and credit crisis  particularly the recession experienced in the united states and australia  is having a negative impact upon our business and we have responded by making a determined effort to reduce personnel costs  capital expenditures  discretionary spending and curtail acquisition activity see part ii 
other information item a 
risk factors for a discussion of the current global economic environment 
we continuously monitor our performance and customer demand levels to find more efficiencies in all aspects of our business 
accordingly  we may continue to reduce headcount or employee compensation in the areas in which we believe we can achieve greater efficiencies without effecting customer service or our sales efforts 
while this is our approach for the foreseeable future  our long term strategy and business plan is to acquire and operate rental services and specialty finance businesses in north america  europe and the asia pacific area 
we currently have two operating subsidiaries  royal wolf and pac van  that lease and sell storage container products  modular buildings and mobile offices through customer service centers cscs in australia  six cscs in new zealand and branch locations across states in the united states 
as of june   we had and employees and  and  lease fleet units in the asia pacific area and united states  respectively 
we do business in two distinct  but related industries  modular space and mobile storage  which we collectively refer to as the portable services industry 
currently  only pac van leases and sells modular space products 
prior to our acquisition of pac van  our revenue mix was approximately sales and leasing 
however  during the year ended june  the mix was sales and leasing 
our products include the following modular space modular buildings 
also known as manufactured buildings  modular buildings provide customers with additional space and are often tailored specifically to satisfy the unique needs of the customer 
depending on the customer s desired application  modular buildings can range in size from  to more than  square feet and may be highly customized 
mobile offices and portable container buildings 
also known as trailers or construction trailers  mobile offices are re locatable units with aluminum or wood exteriors on wood or steel frames on a steel carriage fitted with axles  allowing for an assortment of add ons to provide comfortable and convenient temporary space solutions 
we also offer portable container buildings  ground level offices glo  or office containers  which are either modified or specifically manufactured shipping containers that are used as mobile offices  and in plant units  which are manufactured structures that provide self contained office space with maximum design flexibility 

table of contents mobile storage storage containers 
storage containers generally consist of used shipping containers that have been purchased and refurbished and provide a flexible  low cost alternative to warehousing  while offering greater security  convenience  and immediate accessibility 
our storage products include general purpose dry storage containers  refrigerated containers and specialty containers in a range of standard and modified sizes  designs and storage capacities 
specialty containers include blast resistant units  hoarding units and hazardous waste units 
we also offer storage vans  also known as storage trailers or dock height trailers 
freight containers 
freight containers are specifically designed for transport of products by road and rail 
our freight container products include curtain side  refrigerated and bulk cargo containers  together with a range of standard and industry specific dry freight containers 
results of operations year ended june  fy compared to year ended june  fy we had no business or operations prior to our acquisition of royal wolf on september  comparisons of our results of operations for fy with fy therefore are not particularly meaningful 
we believe a more meaningful comparison is the results of our operations for fy with the combined results of our operations and royal wolf during fy to assist in this comparison  the following table sets forth statements of operations for the following i royal wolf  as predecessor  for the period july  to september   ii the company  as successor  for fy  which reflects the results of operations of royal wolf for the period september  through june   iii the combined results of operations of the predecessor and the successor for fy  and iii the company  as successor  for fy the combined fy results do not reflect any adjustments for the purchase method of accounting in the predecessor period and is presented for comparison purposes only

table of contents revenues 
revenues totaled million in fy  an increase of million  or  from million in fy the increase was primarily due to million of revenues at pac van  which we acquired on october   offset somewhat by a million decrease  or  in revenues in fy from fy at royal wolf 
sales during fy amounted to million compared to million during fy  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in total sales was primarily as a result of a reduction in sales at royal wolf of million  due to a million unfavorable foreign exchange rate effect and decreased sales of million and million in our national accounts group  or non retail operations  and retail operations at the cscs  respectively 
the million decrease in our retail operations consisted of an million reduction due to lower prices  offset somewhat by million from higher unit sales 
the million decrease in our national accounts group consisted of million due to lower unit sales  offset somewhat by higher prices of million 
the decrease in sales at royal wolf was substantially offset by million in sales recognized at pac van during fy  which benefited by a single sale of million in december leasing revenues during fy amounted to million compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was primarily due to leasing revenues recognized at pac van of million  which had a utilization rate of at june  in addition  leasing revenues at royal wolf increased by million  or  in fy from fy this was driven by an increase of million due to growth in the average pricing on lease per month million in our retail business and million in our national accounts group and an increase of million due to growth in the average total number of units on lease per month million in our retail business and million in our national accounts group  offset somewhat by an unfavorable foreign exchange rate effect of million 
at royal wolf  average utilization in the retail operations was during fy  as compared to during fy  and average utilization in the national accounts group operations was during fy  as compared to during fy overall average utilization at royal wolf was in fy  as compared to in fy the average value of the us dollar against the australian dollar strengthened during fy as compared to fy the average currency exchange rate of one australian dollar during fy was us dollar compared to us dollar during fy this fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease to our sales and leasing revenues at royal wolf of million and million  respectively  during fy compared to fy  representing of total revenues in fy sales and leasing revenues represented and of total revenues in fy and and of total revenues in fy  respectively  the more favorable leasing revenue mix in fy resulting primarily from our acquisition of pac van 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased by million to million during fy from million during fy the decrease was primarily due to foreign exchange translation effect of million and cost decreases of million in our retail operations and million in the national account group operations in the asia pacific area  substantially offset by cost of sales incurred at pac van of million 
our gross profit percentage from sales revenues deteriorated during fy to approximately compared to during fy as a result of price decreases and unfavorable product mix that resulted in a gross profit percentage of in the asia pacific area 
this was offset by the more favorable gross profit percentage of at pac van during fy 
table of contents leasing  selling and general expenses 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased by million during fy to million from million during fy this increase included million incurred at pac van and an approximately increase at gfn  which incurred million during fy as compared to million in fy the following table provides more detailed information about the royal wolf operating expenses of million in fy as compared to million in fy year ended june  in millions salaries  wages and related share based payments rent csc operating costs business promotion travel and meals it and telecommunications professional costs other operating expenses at royal wolf decreased by million  or  in fy from fy as a percentage of revenues  it increased to in fy from in fy  primarily as a result of the lower revenues at royal wolf in fy from fy the major decreases in leasing  selling and general expenses for fy were salaries and related payroll costs decreased as a result of staff reductions and lower bonuses  less discretionary spending on retail business csc operating costs including travel and meals  and better control of our professional costs 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses at pac van were during fy pac van s operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are higher than royal wolf s percentage as royal wolf s mix of fy sales to leasing revenue at is higher than the at pac van  pac van has invested in an office modular fleet which is a lower margin product line  and pac van has less density in its retail markets 
overall  total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fy  as compared to in fy depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during fy from million during fy the increase was primarily due to adjustments to fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets as a result of the pac van acquisition  as well as three other smaller acquisitions since june depreciation and amortization at pac van totaled million during fy interest expense 
the increase in interest expense of million in fy to million  as compared to million in fy  was due primarily to the increase in total long term debt  which was million at june  and million at june   and an unrealized loss on interest rate swap and option contracts totaling million 
the increase in total debt since fy was due primarily to our acquisition of pac van and three other smaller acquisitions since june  funded principally with borrowings under the senior credit facility with australia and new zealand banking group limited anz and the secured senior subordinated notes issued to bison capital  as well as the assumption of the senior credit facility with a syndication of four financial institutions led by lasalle national association  now bank of america  na boa  and the senior subordinated secured note payable to spv capital funding  llc spv in connection with our acquisition of pac van 
foreign currency exchange 
we have certain us dollar denominated debt at royal wolf  including intercompany borrowings  which are remeasured at each financial reporting date with the impact of the remeasurement being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from such remeasurement due to changes in the australian exchange rate to the us dollar could have a significant impact in our reported results of operations  as well as any realized gains and losses from the payments on such us dollar denominated debt and intercompany borrowings 
as noted above  the average value of the us dollar against the australian dollar strengthened during fy as compared to fy and  in addition  the us dollar strengthened against the australian dollar from june  to june  the currency exchange rate of one australian dollar at june  was us dollar compared to us dollar at june  in addition  we incurred a significant realized exchange loss of million as a result of royal wolf s repayment of intercompany advances totaling million in september we advanced million of the proceeds received from our warrant exercise program in may to royal wolf for the temporary reduction of long term borrowings prior to the ultimate use of these proceeds in the acquisition of pac van on october  in fy  unrealized and realized foreign exchange losses totaled million and million  respectively 
these foreign exchange losses were somewhat offset in fy by unrealized gains on forward currency exchange contracts  which totaled million 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate which resulted in an income tax benefit increased to during fy from the fy effective rate of  primarily as a result of the favorable income tax impact of the amortization of goodwill acquired in acquisitions made in the asia pacific area  which is deductible for us income tax reporting purposes  and the recognized benefit of australian and us net operating losses 
as of june   we had a us federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires if unused during fiscal years to 
table of contents net income 
we had a net loss of million during fy  as compared to net income of million during fy  primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact of the foreign currency exchange losses and increased interest expense fy versus fy  offset somewhat by the operating profit from pac van  which we acquired on october  year ended june  fy compared to year ended june  fy predecessor successor combined year period from year ended july to ended june  september  june  in thousands revenues sale of containers leasing of containers costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest income interest expense foreign currency exchange gain loss and other income loss before provision for income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest net income revenues 
sales of containers during fy amounted to million compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million or 
this increase was due to growth in revenues from sales of containers in our retail operations of million  sales of million in our national accounts group or non retail operations and million due to favorable foreign exchange rates 
the million increase in our retail operations consisted of million due to higher unit sales and million due to price increases 
the million increase in our national accounts group operations consisted of million due to higher unit sales and million due to price increases 
leasing of container revenues during fy amounted to million compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million  or 
this was driven by favorable foreign exchange rates of million  an increase of million in our average total number of units on lease per month in our portable container building business  which increased by during fy compared to fy  and an increase of million in our average total number of units on lease per month in our portable storage container business  primarily as a result of our acquisition of the assets of ge seaco in november  chs in february  rwnz in april and tomago in june average utilization in our retail operations was during fy  as compared to during fy  and our average utilization in our national accounts group operations was during fy  as compared to during fy overall our average utilization was in fy  as compared to in fy the average value of the us dollar against the australian dollar declined during fy as compared to fy the average currency exchange rate of one australian dollar during fy was us dollar compared to us dollar during fy this fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an increase to our container sales and leasing revenues of million and million  respectively  during fy compared to fy  representing of the increase in total revenues  or of total revenues in fy 
table of contents sales of containers and leasing of containers represented and of total revenues in both fy and fy cost of sales 
cost of sales in our container sales business increased by million to million during fy compared to million during fy the increase was primarily due to foreign exchange translation effect of million and cost increases of million and million in our retail and national account group operations  respectively 
our gross profit margin from sales revenues improved during fy to compared to during fy as a result of price increases and favorable product mix 
leasing  selling and general expenses 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased by million  or  during fy to million from million during fy this increase includes approximately million  or of the increase  incurred at gfn 
the following table provides more detailed information about the royal wolf operating expenses of million in fy as compared to million in fy year ended june  in millions salaries  wages and related share based payments rent csc operating costs business promotion travel and meals it and telecommunications professional costs other fy included a shared based payment expense of approximately million to recognize the full vesting of options as a result of the purchase of approximately of rwa by bison capital in march the increase in fy from fy in salaries  wages and related expenses and csc costs of million and million  respectively  were primarily due to the increase in number of sales and marketing personnel as we continue to expand our infrastructure for growth 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses at royal wolf decreased to in fy from not including the net effect of share based payment in march in fy depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million during fy compared to million during fy the increase was primarily the result of adjustments to fair values of fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
the amortization of identifiable intangible assets customer lists and non compete agreements represented approximately million of this increase 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fy  royal wolf revised the estimated useful life and residual value of its containers for lease fleet 
the financial impact of the revision resulted in depreciation expense for fy being million less than what it would have been if the previous useful life estimate had been applied 
interest income 
we had interest income earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of million in fy interest expense 
the increase in interest expense of million in fy  as compared to fy  was due primarily to an increase in total long term debt  which was million at june  and million at june  the increase in total debt in fy was due primarily to our acquisitions of royal wolf  ge seaco  chs  rwnz and tomago  funded principally with the senior credit facility with australia and new zealand banking group limited  or anz  and the secured senior subordinated notes issued to bison capital 
foreign currency exchange 
as a result of the acquisition of royal wolf  we now have certain us dollar denominated debt at royal wolf  including intercompany borrowings  which are remeasured at each financial reporting date with the impact of the remeasurement being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
we had foreign currency exchange gains of approximately million in fy because the australian dollar strengthened against the us dollar during fy as compared to fy effective october   the foreign exchange effect of the principal balance of the us dollar denominated intercompany borrowings are now included in accumulated other comprehensive income since we do not expect repayment in the foreseeable future 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate decreased to during the fy as a result of certain non deductible amounts included in the fy for australian income tax purposes being extinguished and the amortization of goodwill for us income tax reporting purposes being deductible in fy 
table of contents net income 
we had net income of million during fy compared to net income of million during fy primarily as a result of increased revenues from the sales and leasing of containers in fy  the fact that fy included share based expense of approximately million and the favorable impact of the foreign currency exchange gain  offset somewhat by increased interest expense 
measures not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and other non operating costs ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
these measures are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  income from operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is a non gaap measure 
we calculate adjusted ebitda by adjusting ebitda to eliminate the impact of certain items we do not consider to be indicative of the performance of our ongoing operations 
you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider each to be appropriate 
in addition  in evaluating ebitda and adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future  we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry  many of which present ebitda and adjusted ebitda when reporting their results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda and adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
the following table shows our ebitda and adjusted ebitda  and the reconciliation from operating income predecessor successor combined successor year period from ended july to june  september  year ended june  operating income add depreciation and amortization ebitda add share based compensation expense adjusted ebitda our business is capital intensive  so from an operating level  we focus primarily on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into and provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and fleet growth objectives 
in managing our business  we regularly compare our ebitda margins on a monthly basis 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch or csc  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new market or branch  we must first fund and absorb the start up costs for setting up the new branch facility  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new branch will have low ebitda margins in its early years until the number of units on rent increases 
because of our higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when  the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produces large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent significant growth in leasing revenues  the ebitda margin at a branch will remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis 

table of contents liquidity and financial condition each of our two operating units  royal wolf and pac van  fund their operations substantially independent of one another 
each have term debt and bank credit facilities that provide short term and long term funding and require compliance with various covenants 
these covenants require them to  among other things  maintain certain levels of interest coverage  ebitda  unit utilization rate and overall leverage 
in addition  we have a million credit facility and have certain obligations to bison capital and spv in connection with its purchase of royal wolf and pac van  respectively 
the global economic downturn and credit crises have had and continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business operations  making compliance with the various loan covenants very challenging 
in addition  our leverage has increased due to declining ebitda and asset values 
we have limited access to additional capital except on terms that may be viewed as onerous and expensive 
while we have and continue to proactively manage our various loan agreements and believe we have satisfactory relationships with each lender  continued deterioration of the economies in which we operate could lead to a breach in one or more covenants and the lenders accelerating loan maturities 
during fy  we began negotiations with our lenders to modify various covenants and extend maturities 
these included our amending our senior credit facility with anz see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and our shareholders agreement with bison capital in gfn us see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of these amendments  among other things  was establishing financial covenants on the anz facility at less restrictive levels  as well as revising principal payment requirements  and deferring bison capital s put option on their minority interest in gfn us through which we indirectly own royal wolf to july also  as a result of the anz credit facility amendment  we are required to pay the us denominated principal payment of million due bison capital in july by a capital infusion from gfn 
our required principal and other obligations payments not including the invoice financing facility of million and bison capital s put option for the next three years are as follows fiscal year ending june  a anz senior credit facility and other bison capital subordinated notes first installment due in july holdback note issued in connection with pac van acquisition a the bison put option of a minimum of million is effective on july  we have three principal objectives with respect to our liquidity in the foreseeable future reduce overall leverage in each operating entity by minimizing capital expenditures and using operating cash flow to pay interest and reduce debt 
operate the businesses to meet all loan covenant requirements 
generate sufficient capital  either through operations or external sources  including debt or equity  to meet loan maturities 
depending on our operating performance  we believe we may require up to approximately million of external financing during the fiscal year ending june  in achieving these objectives 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital or maintaining compliance with our loan covenants 
we currently do not pay a dividend on common stock and anticipate using retained earnings to reduce debt for the foreseeable future 
cash flow for fy compared to fy our leasing business is capital intensive and we acquire leasing assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
these leasing assets have very long useful lives and require relatively minimal maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our retail locations  and to add to our breadth of product mix 
our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our reported earnings  particularly due to the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation that is used for tax accounting 
our principal source of capital for operations consists of funds available from the senior secured credit facility with anz and the senior secured credit facility led by boa 
we also finance a smaller portion of capital requirements through finance leases and lease purchase contracts  have a million line of credit with union bank and have outstanding senior subordinated notes with bison capital and spv 
supplemental information pertaining to our combined sources and uses of cash is presented in the table below 

table of contents predecessor successor combined successor year period from ended july to june  september  year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided used by financing activities operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million during fy  as compared to using net cash flow of million during fy the significant increase in operating cash flows of million in fy from fy was  despite the net loss of million  primarily due to non cash adjustments of unrealized losses on foreign exchange and forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps and options of million and million  respectively  as well as depreciation and amortization of million 
this compares to unrealized gains on foreign exchange and forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps and options aggregating to million and depreciation and amortization of million in fy these non cash adjustments in fy more than offset the other adjustments and uses of cash  including the realized foreign exchange losses of million incurred primarily as a result of royal wolf repaying intercompany advances totaling million 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at june   we had a net deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities was million for fy  as compared to million for fy in fy  cash of million was used to acquire royal wolf and four other smaller acquisitions  while in fy we used million to acquire pac van and three other small acquisitions not including non cash issuances of a promissory note and common and preferred stock totaling million 
net capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million in fy and million in fy purchases of property  plant and equipment were million in fy and million in fy in the current economic environment  we anticipate our near term investing activities will be primarily focused on acquiring lease fleet as those specific types of units are not in our fleet and are placed on rent  technology and communication improvements for our telephone and computer systems and for delivery equipment whereby we would derive improved customer service levels and a cost savings 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
other than a preferred supply agreement  which does not have a minimum purchase commitment  but does require us to purchase up to  containers if offered to us  and the put and call options pertaining to bison capital s minority interest of in gfn us  we have no significant long term contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we may be required to purchase at a certain price or a minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our commitments and contingencies 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fy  as compared to million during fy in fy  we used million to fully repay the line of credit with ronald valenta  our chief executive officer  and paid million to our stockholders electing to convert their shares of common stock into cash 
net long term borrowings  primarily under the anz senior credit facility and the bison secured senior subordinated notes  totaled million in fy  as compared to net borrowings of million in fy in addition  net proceeds received from the issuances of our preferred stock totaled million in fy  versus million in fy  of which million was from our warrant exercise program initiated in may these proceeds from our capital issuances and net borrowings were used together with cash flow generated from operations to primarily fund the acquisition of royal wolf  pac van  as well as for seven other small acquisitions  and the expansion of our lease fleet 
financial condition inventories increased from million at june  to million at june   primarily because of the acquisitions of pac van which added million in inventories at june  and our new zealand operations 
trade receivables increased to million at june  from million at june  effective asset management is a significant focus for us  particularly in this current economic environment  as we strive to reduce inventory levels and continue to apply appropriate credit and collection controls to maintain and enhance cash flow and profitability 
property  plant and equipment increased from million at june  to million at june   primarily as a result of our acquisition of pac van 
our total lease fleet increased from million at june  to million at june   primarily due to our acquisition of pac van and three other smaller acquisitions since june at june   we had  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states in our lease fleet  as compared to  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia and  units in new zealand  which are considered retail at june  at those dates   units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia   units in new zealand  which are considered retail  and  units in the united states and  units  units in retail operations in australia   units in national account group operations in australia and  units in new zealand  which are considered retail were on lease  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets increased from a total of million at june  to million at june   as a result of the purchase accounting adjustments in connection with our acquisition of pac van and five other smaller acquisitions since june long term debt and obligations  including current portion  increased from million at june  to million at june   primarily due to the acquisition of pac van and three other smaller acquisitions since june  and the expansion of our lease fleet 
these acquisitions and capital expenditures were funded in large part by issuances of our common and preferred stock  borrowings on the anz senior credit facility and the issuance of a secured senior subordinated note to bison capital  as well as the assumption of the boa senior credit facility and the senior subordinated note payable to spv

seasonality although demand from certain specific customer segments can be seasonal  our operations as a whole are not seasonal to any significant extent 
we experience a reduction in sales volumes at royal wolf during australia s summer holiday break from mid december to the end of january  followed by february being a short working day month 
however  this reduction in sales typically is counterbalanced by the increased lease revenues derived from the relocations industry  which experiences its seasonal peak of personnel relocations during this same summer holiday break 
demand from some of pac van s customers can be seasonal  such as in the construction industry  which tends to increase leasing activity in the first and fourth quarters  while customers in the retail industry tend to lease more units in the second quarter 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
however  during periods of rising prices and  in particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may incur significant increases in our operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in a timely manner  which could harm our future results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables 
accordingly  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
on a recurring basis  we evaluate a variety of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of our customers  its days outstanding trends  a review of historical collection results and a review of specific past due receivables 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net income 
to date  uncollectible accounts have been within the range of our expectations 
we lease and sell storage container products  modular buildings and mobile offices to our customers 
leases to customers are generally short term  which qualify as operating leases 
the aggregate lease payments are generally less than the purchase price of the equipment 
revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the lease terms established by the lease agreements and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales of equipment is recognized upon delivery and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a fleet of storage containers  mobile offices  modular buildings and steps that we lease to customers under operating lease agreements with varying terms 
the lease fleet or lease or rental equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on the straight line basis over the estimated useful life years  after the date the units are put in service  and are depreciated down to their estimated residual values of cost 
in our opinion  estimated residual values are at or below net realizable values 
we continue to evaluate these depreciation policies as more information becomes available from other comparable sources and our own historical experience 
for the issuances of stock options  we follow the fair value provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of employee share based compensation expense in the statements of income over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock option at the grant date 
the pricing model we use for determining fair values of the purchase option is the black scholes pricing model 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates  market prices and volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income 
in particular  the company uses volatility rates based upon a sample of comparable companies in the company s industry and a risk free interest rate  which is the rate on us treasury instruments  for a security with a maturity that approximates the estimated remaining expected term of the stock option 

table of contents we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we will test goodwill annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate that there might be impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we have determined that no impairment provision related to goodwill was required to be recorded as of june  intangible assets include those with indefinite trademark and trade name  and finite primarily customer base and lists  non compete agreements and deferred financing costs useful lives 
customer base and lists and non compete agreements are amortized on the straight line basis over the expected period of benefit which range from one to ten years 
costs to obtaining long term financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the straight line method 
amortizing the deferred financing costs using the straight line method does not produce significantly different results than that of the effective interest method 
we review intangibles those assets resulting from acquisitions at least annually for impairment or when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
we have determined that an impairment related to the customer base acquired in the pac van acquisition was required to be recorded as of june   as a result of changes in market conditions in the us therefore  in the fourth quarter of fy  we  to be more in line with the expected revenue stream of the customer base  recorded the impairment by revising the method of amortization from a straight line to an accelerated basis 
the financial impact of the revision resulted in an impairment expense for fy of  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination 
no valuation allowance has been determined to be required as of june  we have adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no
