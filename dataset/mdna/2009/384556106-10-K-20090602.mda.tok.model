our balance sheet is strong and free of bank debt 
we are a global designer and manufacturer of custom engineered ejectors  vacuum systems  condensers  liquid ring pump packages and heat exchangers 
our equipment is used in critical applications in the petrochemical  oil refinery and electric power generation industries  including cogeneration and geothermal plants 
our equipment can also be found in diverse applications  such as metal refining  pulp and paper processing  shipbuilding  water heating  refrigeration  desalination  soap manufacturing  food processing  pharmaceuticals  heating  ventilating and air conditioning 
our corporate offices and production facilities are located in batavia  new york 
we also have a wholly owned foreign subsidiary located in suzhou  china 
our subsidiary in china serves to support sales orders from asia and provides engineering support and supervision of subcontracted fabrication 
market conditions fiscal and the near term fiscal saw a shift for our customers and for graham 
in the first half of fiscal  the continuation of increased capital spending by our customers resulted in strong orders for us 
in mid fiscal  the global financial crisis rapidly created a credit freeze and uncertainty resulting in a dramatic decline in capital spending and  hence  new orders for graham dropped significantly 
while this did not have a major adverse impact on fiscal revenues  it did affect second half orders and year end backlog 
orders in the second half of fiscal were  compared with orders of  in the same period of fiscal looking at fiscal  we believe the current downturn in the global economy  which is reflected in the refinery and petrochemical markets that we serve  will continue and pose a near term challenge for our customers to invest in major capital projects 
we also believe that the significant increase in construction costs  including raw material costs  which has occurred over the past four to five years  is leading to a delay in new commitments by our customers as they expect construction costs to decrease following the recent declines in commodity costs 
on a quarterly basis in fiscal  we expect our new order levels to be volatile  resulting in both good and weak quarters 
a good example of this was the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  which had new order levels of  and  respectively 
we believe looking at our order levels in one quarter will not provide an accurate indication of future expectations  rather looking at orders over a rolling four quarter time period will be a better measure of our business 

table of contents market view long term view shift back to international growth over the long term  we expect our customers markets to regain their historical strength and grow for the foreseeable future 
we believe the long term trends remain strong 
the drivers of future growth are global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next two decades  primarily in developing countries 
increased demand is expected for power  refinery and petrochemical products  caused by the expanding middle class in asia 
as demand grows  global oil refining capacity increases are expected to be addressed through new facilities  refinery upgrades  revamps and expansions 
known supplies of sweet crude oil are being depleted 
sour crude sources are identified and believed to be plentiful 
differential in raw material prices for sweet and sour crude oil 
to lower production costs  many refineries will continue to upgrade facilities in order to be able to process sour crude oil  which requires an upgrade of vacuum and heat transfer equipment of the types we design and manufacture 
increased global regulations over the refining and petrochemical industries will continue and drive demand for capital activity 
construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east  where natural gas is plentiful and less expensive 
refineries in the united states will be upgraded to process synthetic crude oil from the alberta oil sands region of canada 
increased need in certain regions for geothermal electrical power plants to meet increased electricity demand 
long term growth potential in emerging energy market opportunities  such as coal to liquids  gas to liquids and other emerging technologies  such as biodiesel  ethanol and waste to energy 
all of these markets offer long term growth opportunity for us as major project work will be necessary to meet our customers expected capital project needs 
in addition  we believe we can continue to grow our less cyclical smaller product lines and aftermarket businesses 
we believe that many of the drivers noted above are in the international arena 
we expect that in the future  international opportunities will be more plentiful relative to domestic projects 
our domestic sales as a percentage of product sales increased over the past three fiscal years from in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal the economic strength of the us  especially the us refining market drove this trend 
as we look forward  we believe this trend will reverse itself and international sales will be at a similar level as domestic sales over the next few years and could surpass domestic sales as early as forward looking statements this annual report on form k and other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales net income diluted income per share identifiable assets fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with sales of  for fiscal this growth in sales came from all product lines  of the gain came from pumps  from spare parts  and the remaining from condensers  ejectors and heat exchangers 
international sales accounted for of all sales for fiscal  which was down from in fiscal the strength of the us refining market was primarily responsible for this shift in fiscal domestic sales grew  in fiscal international sales declined by in fiscal  driven by sales declines in south america and the middle east due to a slowdown in investment in new capacity 
sales for fiscal were to the refining industry up from in fiscal  to the chemical and petrochemical industries down from and to other industrial applications up from  including electrical power 
our gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gross profit dollars for fiscal increased  compared with fiscal gross profit dollars increased due to increased volume  improved product mix achieved by increased selectivity on orders accepted  and improved engineering and manufacturing efficiencies 
our improved operating efficiencies  which are a continuation of the gains seen in fiscal  enabled us to achieve greater sales volume in fiscal without spending significant capital or increasing other fixed costs to increase our manufacturing capacity 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal remained similar to the fiscal level of 
actual costs in fiscal increased  or  compared with fiscal sg a expenses increased due to greater variable costs eg  sales commissions  variable compensation related to higher sales and net income 

table of contents during fiscal  we restructured our workforce  eliminating certain management  office and manufacturing positions 
the restructuring resulted in a pre tax charge to earnings of this cost was reported as other expense 
our on going annual cost savings as a result of the restructuring is expected to be approximately  interest income for fiscal was  down from  in fiscal this decrease was due to lower rates of return on our investments  which are primarily short term us treasury securities 
interest expense was in fiscal  down from in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared with an effective tax rate of for fiscal the increase was due to a higher level of pre tax income relative to our allowable level of tax deductions

the following table shows the balance of stockholders equity on the dates indicated march  march  march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  this increase was primarily due to net income  offset by a decline in the value of pension assets 
in july  we increased our dividend per share from cents per share per year to cents per year 
dividends paid in fiscal increased  or  due to the above mentioned increase as well as an increase in mid fiscal in fiscal  we increased authorized shares from  to  in october  we split our stock for  increasing the actual outstanding shares to  shares 
we subsequently repurchased shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase program 
on march   our net book value was up over march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or  at march  compared with march  eighty four percent of this increase was due to the increase in net income  was due to stock options exercised  and was for other reasons 
in october  we increased our dividend per share from cents per share per year to cents per year 
dividends paid in fiscal increased  or  due to this increase and due to additional shares outstanding 
on march   our net book value was  up over march  liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets march  working capital working capital ratio long term debt capital leases long term debt capitalization long term liabilities capitalization working capital equals current assets minus current liabilities 
working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities 
long term debt capitalization equals long term debt divided by stockholders equity plus long term debt 
long term liabilities capitalization equals total liabilities minus current liabilities divided by stockholders equity plus long term debt

amounts represent anticipated contributions during fiscal to our postretirement medical benefit plan  which provides healthcare benefits for eligible retirees and eligible survivors of retirees 
on february   we terminated postretirement healthcare benefits for our us employees 
benefits payable to retirees of record on april  remained unchanged 
we expect to be required to make cash contributions in connection with these plans beyond one year  but such amounts cannot be estimated 
no contributions are expected to be made to our defined benefit pension plan for fiscal net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal while net income was greater in fiscal  favorable cash flow from timing of accounts receivable achieved in was not repeatable 
we are continuing to work to reduce our overall operating working capital operating working capital equals accounts receivable plus inventory minus accounts payable 
our cash conversion cycle is down to days at march   compared to days as of march  and days as of march  cash conversion cycle equals days sales outstanding plus days inventory on hand minus days payables outstanding 
the decrease in our cash conversion cycle was accomplished through continued focus on accounts receivable and inventory balances during fiscal sales in fiscal were managed with an average operating working capital level of of sales compared with in fiscal and in fiscal we invest net cash generated from operations in excess of cash held for near term needs in us government instruments  generally with maturity periods of up to days 
investments at march  and march  were  and  respectively 
this increase was responsible for the majority of the growth in working capital 
significant sources of cash for fiscal included the issuance of common stock to cover stock options exercised  which raised  as compared with  in fiscal in addition  in fiscal we recognized a  increase in capital in excess of par value for the income tax benefit realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of the tax benefit amount recognized pertaining to the fair value of stock option awards treated as compensation expense 
this amount compared with  for fiscal other significant uses of cash for fiscal included our stock repurchase program 
under this program  shares of stock were purchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal at a cost of  representing an average price of per share 
dividend payments of and capital expenditures of  were made in fiscal  compared with and  respectively  for fiscal in fiscal  we contributed  into our defined benefit pension plan  compared with  for fiscal in fiscal  we repaid in excess of amounts borrowed for bank borrowings and capitalized leases  as compared with for fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal were for plant machinery and equipment and for all other items 
seventy eight percent of our capital spending was for productivity improvements and the balance was primarily for capitalized maintenance 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately  with the planned investment expected to be for machinery and equipment  for information technology and for 
table of contents all other items 
we estimate of our capital budget in fiscal will support productivity improvements with the balance primarily for capitalized maintenance projects 
our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na provides a line of credit of  including letters of credit and bank guarantees 
borrowings under our credit facility are secured by all of our assets 
letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility on march  and were  and  respectively 
other utilization of our credit facility limits at march  and were our borrowing rate as of march  was bank of america s prime rate minus basis points  or 
we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with our investments and available financing capacity under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our cash needs for the immediate future 
orders and backlog orders during fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively  representing a decrease for fiscal orders represent communications received from customers requesting us to supply products and services 
revenue is recognized on orders received in accordance with our revenue recognition policy included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in orders occurred in the second half of fiscal orders in the first half of fiscal were  compared with  in the same period of fiscal however  orders in the second half of fiscal were  compared with  in the second half of fiscal as previously discussed  during the second half of fiscal  our customers were impacted by the global financial crisis and recession  causing them to reduce capital spending 
this in turn had a negative impact on our orders 
domestic orders were  or  of our total orders and international orders were  or  of our total orders in fiscal the international orders grew in asia by  and represented of all orders for the year  up from in fiscal backlog was  at march  compared with  at march   a decrease 
backlog is defined by us as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
during fiscal  we were notified by customers that three projects with a value of  were cancelled and five orders with a value of  were placed on hold suspended pending further evaluation 
our backlog has been reduced for the cancelled projects  but continues to include orders placed on hold suspended see project cancellation and project continuation risk in item a 
all orders in backlog represent orders from our traditional markets in established product lines 
approximately of orders currently in backlog is not expected to be converted to sales within the next twelve months 
at march   approximately of our backlog was attributed to equipment for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 
at march   approximately of our backlog was for refinery project work  for chemical and petrochemical projects  and for other industrial or commercial applications 
contingencies and commitments we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work or were settled by us for amounts below expected defense costs 
neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this time 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings and potential claims 
as of march   other than noted above  we were unaware of any other pending litigation matters 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this 
table of contents annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred as of a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized immediately  when evident to management 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contracts after the revenue is recognized 
pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
critical accounting estimates and judgments we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k and believe those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to labor hour estimates used to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method  accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
as discussed above under the heading critical accounting policies  we recognize the substantial amount of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the key estimate of percentage of completion accounting is total labor to be incurred on each contract and to the extent that this estimate changes  it may significantly impact revenue recognized in each period 

table of contents contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require us to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
for more information on these matters see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
the discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined in conjunction with our actuary by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments 
the discount rate assumption for fiscal is for our defined benefit pension and for our other postretirement benefit plan 
a reduction in the discount rate of basis points  with all other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan by approximately and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of used in accounting for our pension plan is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long term investment returns 
a reduction in the rate of return of basis points  with other assumptions held constant  would have increased fiscal net periodic pension expense by approximately as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our managers with functional responsibilities for financial  credit  tax  engineering  manufacturing and benefit matters  and outside advisors such as lawyers  consultants and actuaries 
we believe that the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k related to revenue  contingencies  pensions  other post retirement benefits and other matters requiring the use of estimates and judgments are reasonable  although actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in the market to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates  price risk and project cancellation risk 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate  price risk and project cancellation risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal were of total sales compared with for fiscal operating in markets throughout the world exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
in addition  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to us dollars 
in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we had no sales for which we were paid in foreign currencies 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge our exposure against potential unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our purchases in foreign currencies represented  and  respectively  of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts were not used in fiscal or fiscal  and as of march  and  respectively  we held no forward foreign currency contracts 
price risk operating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which  in some instances  benefit from lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions 
although we believe that our customers differentiate our products on the basis of our manufacturing quality and engineering experience and excellence  among other things  such lower production costs and more favorable economic conditions mean that certain of our competitors are able to offer products similar to ours at lower prices 
moreover  the cost of metals and other materials used in our products have experienced significant volatility 
such factors  in addition to the global 
table of contents effects of the recent volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets  have resulted in downward demand and pricing pressure on our products 
project cancellation and project continuation risk recent economic conditions have led to a higher likelihood of project cancellation by our customers 
we had three projects totaling  cancelled in fiscal while this risk continues to be evident  we structure contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred 
we  therefore  believe we do not have a significant cash exposure to potentially cancelled projects 
open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers 
if it becomes evident that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date  management will move the project into placed on hold category 
furthermore  if a project is cancelled by our customer  we will remove this from our backlog
