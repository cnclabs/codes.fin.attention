major events impacting financial condition and results of operations from june through march  the annual and the periodic interim reports of integramed america  inc and subsidiaries were the subject of a standard comment and review process by the staff of the division of corporation finance of the securities and exchange commission sec 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles to the company s attain ivf program s multiple element revenue arrangements is complex and management s interpretation of the applicable authoritative literature related to the timing of the recognition of the fair value of revenue for the non refundable portion of the attain ivf program fees differed from that of the sec which caused us to re evaluate the company s revenue recognition policies 
as a result  the company restated its prior financial statements with respect to the timing of revenue recognition for its attain ivf program formerly shared risk refund program within its consumer services division 
our previous revenue recognition policy had generally recognized the non refundable patient fees generally of the contract amount as revenue upon the completion of the first treatment cycle 
we now recognize the non refundable fees based on the relationship of the fair value of each treatment to the total fair value of the treatment package available to each patient 
we also recognize a warranty reserve representing the estimated cost of services to be provided in the event a qualified patient miscarries 
this restatement does not impact the cash flows from operations of this program or the ultimate profits to be recognized  only the timing of the revenue recognition for a portion of the fees that we collect from our customers

our fertility centers revenue increased as a result of growth within our existing medical practices  as well as the addition of two new partner arrangements and the full year of results of a partner added in the third quarter of expansion continued in our consumer services segment  driven by the continued expansion of its attain ivf program 
in addition to our fertility segments  our performance for the twelve months ended december   included full year results from our vein clinics division which was purchased on august  for the year ended december   total revenues of million increased approximately million  or from the same period in our fertility centers revenue increased as a result of growth within the underlying medical practices  the addition of one new partner arrangement and the expansion of the shady grove contract in expansion continued in our consumer services segment  driven by the growth of its attain ivf program 
in addition to growth within these two segments  on august   we acquired vein clinics of america  inc this leading provider of vein disease treatment became our third operating segment and contributed million to our revenues 
a segment by segment discussion is presented below 
fertility centers segment in providing clinical care to patients  each of our partner practices generates patient revenue which we do not report in our financial statements 
although we do not consolidate the physician fertility practice financials with our own  these financials do directly affect our revenues 
the components of our revenue from each of the partner practices are o a base service fee calculated as a percentage of patient revenue as reported by the partner practice this percentage varies from down to depending on the level of patient revenues  o cost of services equal to reimbursement for the expenses which we advanced to the partner practice during the month representing substantially all of the expenses incurred by the practice  o our additional fees which represent our share of the net income of the partner practice which varies from to or a fixed amount depending on the partner practice 
in addition to these revenues generated from our fertility centers  we often receive miscellaneous other revenues related to providing services to medical practices 
from the total of our revenues  we subtract the annual amortization of our business service rights  which are the rights to provide business services to each of the partner practices 
fertility center revenues in the year ended december   increased by million or from the same period in this compares to an increase of million  or for the year ended december  versus during both years  growth was largely attributable to same center year over year growth in our network of underlying medical practices 
influencing this growth is our focus on increasing patient revenues through effective multi faceted marketing programs  as well as our continued focus on expense management which drives operational efficiency and higher contribution margins 
revenues for the year ended december   also benefited from a the inclusion of a new fertility partner in mount pleasant  south carolina which contributed million to our net revenue since its addition in april  b full year results from our orlando  florida partner added in september  and c the full year impact from the expansion of shady grove into the baltimore  maryland market in july in july  we also entered into a twenty five year contract with an established fertility clinic based in phoenix  arizona 
under the terms of this agreement we will phase in the implementation of our full suite of partner services over time 
under this arrangement  our fees are currently calculated as a fixed percentage of the clinics revenues with an option to expand into our standard three tiered fee structure  in line with expanded partner services  based upon the center meeting certain performance targets

the following summarized quarterly data for  and is presented for additional analysis and demonstration of the slight seasonality of the fertility division 
the volumes in the first quarter of each year are typically lower than the balance of the year as many patients do not wish to prepare for the ivf procedure in the last month of the year  resulting in fewer ivf ready patients in january and february 
contributing to the lower volumes are voluntary laboratory closures at year end at several of our labs in order to undergo normal maintenance in thousands  except new patient visits and ivf cases completed

consumer services segment for the year ended december   revenues of million from our attain ivf program represented approximately of our consumer services segment revenues 
this compares to revenues of million  or slightly over of consumer services revenues in revenue growth in the attain ivf program of million  or  in was the result of enrolling more patients into the program and increasing patient through put by maintaining  high pregnancy success rates 
similarly  attain ivf revenue growth of million  or  in versus was also attributable to expanded enrollments relative to the earlier year  coupled with high pregnancy rates 
over the past four years  enrollments in our attain ivf program have grown at a compound annual rate of  while pregnancy success rates have either been maintained or increased 
since our customers in the attain ivf program prepay for their suite of services  and a significant portion of the fees received by us are not recognized until the patient achieves pregnancy  our attain ivf deposits and deferred revenue balance continues to grow each year as the number of enrolled patients grow

revenues from our affiliate program were million for the year  which is approximately unchanged from the years ended december  and although our affiliate program produces significant revenues on a stand alone basis  the primary value of the twenty two enrolled clinics as of december   is to serve as a distribution channel for our attain ivf program and as an introduction to our services for medical practices which move on to become full fertility partners 
during  four independent fertility clinics joined our affiliate program and two left in partner related transactions for a net increase of two clinics 
for the year ended december   our affiliate program had a net reduction of one clinic as one practice moved up to our partner program 
pharmaceutical revenue of million for the year ended december   was approximately equal to the prior period in  and down slightly from million in our pharmaceutical revenues are comprised of marketing support fees we earn based upon underlying product margin as reported by a third party pharmaceutical distributor 
over the past several years we have seen flat or declining revenues due to pharmaceutical cost increases which the distributor has been unable to pass on to the consumer as a result of competitive pressures 
we view these pricing and margin developments as longer term structural elements within the pharmaceutical market do not expect significant improvement during as such we are anticipating not renewing our contract with the third party distributor when it expires in vein clinics segment revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million versus partial year revenues of million in revenues for the year ended december   represent operating results only since this segment was purchased on august  vein clinic revenues are generally from billings to patients or their insurer for vein disease treatment services  as opposed to the service fees and reimbursed costs earned by our fertility centers segment 
for comparable purposes  revenues reported by vca on a stand alone basis for the twelve months ended december  were million 
as of december   revenues at established clinics opened one year or more rose by million  or  to million from million for the full twelve months of during we also opened our planned five new clinics  for a total of as of december   versus three clinics opened in  as we continued to successfully execute our expansion plans

vca operated clinics at the end of  clinics at the end of and at the end of contribution for the year ended december   total contribution of million was up approximately million  or from the same period in increased contribution in our fertility centers segment in was the result of the increased profitability in our platform of existing clinics as well as the addition of acquisition related results 
the continued growth of our attain ivf program and full year results from our vein clinics segment were also major contributors to the improvement 
for the year ended december   contribution growth was million  or  versus the comparable period in the increase in contribution in  versus  was fueled mainly by organic growth in our fertility centers division coupled with partial year results from our vein care division acquired in august contribution results for our consumer division in were essentially even with  as growth in our attain ivf program was offset by declining fees from pharmaceutical sales 
a segment by segment discussion is presented below 
fertility centers segment fertility center contribution of million for the year ended december   increased approximately million  or  from prior year levels 
although this segment experienced revenue growth of in  versus the prior year  margin growth was tempered by additional division level infrastructure investments 
these investments  which totaled million during  were designed to support continuing growth and new acquisitions within this segment 
excluding this additional infrastructure  contribution from operations grew million  or  for the twelve months ended december   versus the year earlier period 
approximately million of the increase in contribution came from our new fertility partners with the remaining centers generating contribution growth of million versus the prior year 
fertility center contribution for the year increased approximately million  or from the same period in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the continued revenue and margin growth of our existing fertility centers  and entry into new fertility markets in baltimore  maryland and orlando  florida 
contribution growth rates for our existing partners averaged in  versus the prior year 
the new markets entered into during the second half of generated contribution of more than  consumer services segment contribution from our consumer services segment grew by million to million for the twelve months ended december  versus a contribution of million in the year earlier period 
this growth was driven by our attain ivf program in which the two key profitability metrics ie  the number of patients receiving treatment and pregnancy success rates showed year over year improvement in versus contribution from both our affiliate and pharmaceutical programs in  were on par with results in although our affiliate program grew by a net of two fertility practices during  the underlying value of this program is to serve as a distribution channel for our attain ivf and patient financing products as well as a source of future partner programs 
also  as noted previously  the market for pharmaceutical products in which we participate has been subject to external pricing pressures which have restricted revenues and profitability 
for the year ended december   contribution of million from our consumer services segment was down slightly from the million earned in the prior year 
while enrollments in our attain ivf program grew in versus  pregnancy rates during were at the low end of our expected range and impacted the amount of revenue recognized as we record the bulk of our revenue at the time of pregnancy 
contribution from our pharmaceutical line  down million  or was due to a previously mentioned unfavorable pricing and reimbursement environment 
vein clinics segment for the year ended december   contribution from our vein clinics division of million was up million from reported results 
year versus year comparisons for this segment are not directly comparable as results only include contribution generated since this segment was acquired in august during the fourth quarter of  this segment generated contribution of  as compared to  in the fourth quarter of this improved performance is attributed to a enhanced efficiency and retention at the clinic operational level  b improvements in revenue cycle management  c the opening of five additional clinics in versus  net of associated start up costs and d savings from integrating vca s administrative functions with the corporate shared services group 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses are comprised of salaries and benefits  administrative  regulatory compliance  and operational support costs defined as our shared services group  which are not specifically related to individual clinical operations or other divisional operations 
these costs totaled million for the year  million in and million in we measure our success by relating g a costs to operating contribution 
for twelve months ended december   g a expenses were of contribution which compares favorably to ratios of for the same period in and in we continue to actively manage g a expenses in an effort to leverage our support services group and extract economies of scale from within the organization 
interest net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to net interest income of million for the year  and net interest income of million in the change in net interest income expense for the three years ended december   is primarily the result of utilizing cash on hand and additional borrowings as the principal means of financing our acquisition of vca in august this acquisition used approximately million of cash from our balance sheet in addition to million of new borrowings 
coupled with this cash outlay is a reduction in the general level of interest rates as well as a slow down in various credit markets which has resulted in restrictions on the interest income we are able to earn on our cash balances 
subject to interest rate fluctuations  we anticipate interest expense to decrease gradually in the coming quarters as scheduled debt repayments reduce our outstanding principle balances 
interest income of million for the year ended december  was below that of the prior year by million  or a reduction of  primarily as a result of lower market interest rates and conditions in the credit markets which limited investment opportunities 
interest expense of million for the year ended december   exceeded that of the prior year by million  or primarily due to interest charges on new borrowings done in august  associated with the vca acquisition 
for the year ended december   interest income increased million  or  from the same period in  as a result of earnings on idle cash balances during the first seven months of interest expense of million for the year ended december   increased by million from the same period in  as a result of mid year borrowings associated with the vca acquisition 
income tax provision our provision for income tax was approximately million  million and million for the three years ended december   and respectively  or  and of pre tax income  respectively 
our effective tax rates for all years reflect provisions for both federal and state income taxes 
the low effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was mainly due to an  tax benefit related to the elimination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the lower effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was mainly due to benefits received from tax exempt interest income 
we expect the effective tax rate to approximate in effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

fin r consolidation of variable interest entities vie s addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
as of december   through the acquisition of the vein clinics of america  inc  we have interests in the individual vein clinics  where we are the primary beneficiary and obligor of their financial results our contract provides for us to receive any excess or deficit profits from the vein clinics 
as such we have consolidated these vein clinic operations in our financial statements in accordance with the provisions of fin r 
since we do not have any financial interest in the individual fertility clinics and we are not the primary beneficiary or obligor of their financial results our contracts provide for the physician owners of the clinics to receive any excess or deficit profits  we do not consolidate the results of the fertility clinics in our accounts 
also  since we do not have any interest in the captive insurance provider where we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not consolidate the results of the captive insurance company in our accounts 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as compared to million at december  we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  at december   slightly improved from a deficit of million as of december  attain ivf deferred revenue and other patient deposits  which are reflected as a current liability  represent funds received from patients in advance of treatment cycles and are an indication of future revenues and expected to be recognized as income within twelve to eighteen months 
these deposits totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these deposits are a significant source of cash flow and represent interest free financing for us 
as of december   we did not have any significant contractual commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets or construction of leasehold improvements 
however  we anticipate upcoming capital expenditures of approximately million in these expenditures are primarily related to medical equipment  information system infrastructure and leasehold improvements 
we believe that our current working capital level  specifically cash and cash equivalents  is at adequate levels to fund our operations and our commitments for fixed asset acquisitions 
we also believe that the cash flows from our operations plus our available credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our future liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
in august   as part of our acquisition of vein clinics of america  we secured a new million year term loan 
our previous term loan of million was paid off in its entirety as part of this agreement 
after deducting the previous loan amount  interest and fees  our net funding from bank of america was million 
in order to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with this term loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement on of the principal amount 
this swap transaction acts an effective hedge fixing the interest rate on half of our term loan at plus the applicable margin for the life of the loan 
other features of this credit facility include a million three year revolving line of credit 
as of december   there was a balance of million outstanding under this revolving line of credit 
each component of our amended credit facility bears interest by reference to bank of america s prime rate or libor  at our option  plus a margin  which is dependent upon a leverage test  ranging from to in the case of libor based loans 
prime based loans are made at bank of america s prime rate and do not contain an additional margin 
interest on the prime based loans is payable quarterly beginning november  and interest on libor based loans is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
as of december   interest on the term loan was payable at a rate of approximately

availability of borrowings under the working capital revolver is based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december  under the revolving line of credit the full amount of million was available  of which million was outstanding

we also have commitments to provide working capital financing to member clinics in our fertility centers division 
a significant portion of this commitment relates to our transactions with the medical practices themselves 
our responsibilities to the these medical practices are to provide financing for their accounts receivable and to hold patient deposits on their behalf as well as undistributed physician earnings 
disbursements to the medical practices generally occur monthly 
the medical practice s repayment hierarchy consists of the following o we provide a cash credit to the practice for billings to patients and insurance companies  o we reduce the cash credit for clinic expenses that we have incurred on behalf of the practice  o we reduce the cash credit for the base portion of our service fee which relates to the partner revenues  o we reduce the cash credit for the variable portion of our service fee which relates to the partner earnings  o we disburse to the medical practice the remaining cash amount which represents the physician s undistributed earnings 
we are also responsible for the collection of the partner accounts receivables  which we finance with full recourse 
we continuously fund these needs from our cash flow from operations  the collection of prior months receivables and deposits from patients in advance of treatment 
if delays in repayment are incurred  which have not as yet been encountered  we could draw on our existing working capital line of credit 
we also make payments on behalf of the partner for which we are reimbursed in the short term 
other than these payments  as a general course  we do not make other advances to the medical practice

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our interest income and expense items are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
during the third quarter of we entered into a derivative transaction designed to hedge of our  variable interest rate term loan maturing in as a result of this derivative transaction we have partially shielded ourselves from interest rate risks associated with that portion of this loan as the hedge instrument essentially converts that portion of the loan to a fixed rate instrument  currently at plus the applicable margin 
we are currently subject to interest rate risks associated with the remaining of our term loan as well as our short term investments and certain advances to our fertility partner clinics  all of which are tied to either short term interest rates  libor or the prime rate 
as of december   a one percent change in interest rates would impact our pre tax income by approximately  annually
