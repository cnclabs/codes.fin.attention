table of contents part i item business overview we are a leading specialty contractor operating mainly throughout the united states and across a range of industries 
our core activities are the building  installation  maintenance and upgrade of utility and communications infrastructure  including but not limited to  electrical utility transmission and distribution  wind farm  other renewable energy and natural gas infrastructure  wireless  wireline and satellite communications and water and sewer systems 
our primary customers are in the following industries utilities including wind farms and other renewable energy  natural gas gathering systems and pipeline infrastructure  communications including telephony  satellite television and cable television and government including water and sewer  utilities and communications work on military bases 
we  or our predecessor companies  have been in business for over years 
we offer our services primarily under the mastec service mark and operate through a network of approximately locations and approximately  employees as of december  we have consistently ranked among the top specialty contractors by engineering news record over the past five years 
we serve a diversified domestic customer base including directv  at t  verizon  tetra tech  energy transfer company  embarq  progress energy  qwest and xto energy 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenues were from our ten largest customers 
we have longstanding relationships with many customers and often provide services under multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
we have continued our diversification and expansion strategy through several recent acquisitions which have expanded our service offerings to customers 
during and  we acquired the remaining ownership interest in globetec construction  llc 
globetec is involved in the construction and maintenance of water and sewer pipelines and projects 
in october  we acquired three phase line construction  inc  which is involved in the construction and maintenance of transmission and distribution utility systems  substation and storm restoration in several northern states and has a largely unionized workforce which is required for some projects 
in december  we acquired certain assets of power partners  llc  an electrical utility contractor specializing in wind farm electrical system design and construction 
in may  we acquired pumpco  inc  a mid stream natural gas pipeline construction company 
in july  we acquired certain assets of nsoro  llc  which specializes in wireless network design  construction  upgrade and maintenance 
finally  in december  we acquired wanzek construction  inc  a construction company focusing on wind farm  heavy civil and industrial and infrastructure construction 
industry trends our industry is composed of national  regional and local companies that provide outsourced infrastructure services to customers in the utilities and communications industries as well as to government customers 
we believe the following industry trends impact demand for our services stimulus act 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the stimulus act  signed on february   should have a positive impact on our customer spending in a number of important areas  plus offer additional incentives that should benefit our business 
the stimulus act provides for federal tax incentives applicable to the wind energy industry including the extension of the production tax credit to wind projects placed into service before  and a new investment tax credit equal to of the cost of certain qualifying assets that may be elected in lieu of the production tax credit 
the production tax credit provides the owner of a us wind facility consisting of the pad  tower and turbine with a ten year credit against its federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity 
the stimulus act also includes a new us treasury grant program which allows taxpayers that elect to claim the investment tax credit to receive grants from the us treasury equal to the amount of the investment tax credit in lieu of such credit 
the stimulus act also extends the bonus depreciation deduction for property placed in service in historically  these 
table of contents incentives have increased the construction activity in this sector and are expected to do so in the future 
the stimulus act also contains several provisions aimed at improving the us s electrical transmission system in part to facilitate the transfer of renewable energy from rural areas to high demand areas  including billion in funds for renewable energy and transmission loan guarantees  which are expected to facilitate more than billion in loans for these projects 
the stimulus act also provides for billion in funds for the development of broadband facilities throughout the united states 
renewable energy projects 
the desire to decrease the country s dependence on foreign oil imports and the awareness of the potential effect of global warming have created demand for more domestic  environmentally sensitive electrical power production such as wind and solar collection farms 
according to the american wind energy association  as of december   the united states had approximately  megawatts of installed wind farm generating capacity with approximately  megawatts currently under construction 
in addition  as of august  states in the united states and the district of columbia have already adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals  which standards require or target that an average of of electricity be produced from renewable sources  like wind power 
as a result of these trends  emerging energy research  or eer  forecasted that more than billion will be invested in additional wind energy capacity in the united states through the stimulus act  which calls for expansion of domestic renewable energy sources through tax incentives and loan guarantees  should also provide our wind farm business with the potential for sustained growth 
wind power generation is only feasible where adequate average wind speed and consistency are present 
the principal onshore wind resource in the united states is located in the central plains area of the country  roughly from the texas panhandle to the canadian border 
this wind corridor is a relatively remote area where population density and industrial energy demand are relatively low 
as a result  there are often few traditionally fueled generation facilities in these areas and extensive collection and transmission projects are also necessary to connect these renewable energy generation projects to the electrical grid 
we believe that demand for new domestic sources of clean power generation and the related substations and transmission lines necessary to connect them to the electrical grid will provide significant growth prospects for the foreseeable future 
the new generation of wind turbines can produce electrical power at competitive rates 
currently  less than of the united states electrical needs are met by wind power generation 
a july report by the us department of energy  however  presents a roadmap for increasing wind power generation to of demand by  which would require hundreds of billions of dollars in new wind farm investment and transmission lines 
inadequacy of existing electric power transmission and distribution networks 
the united states electric transmission and distribution infrastructure requires significant ongoing maintenance  upgrades and extensions to manage power line congestion and avoid delivery failures 
according to a november report published by the edison electric institute  or eei  the projected investment in new transmission systems from to is billion and billion for the period to additionally  new renewable energy generation projects  including wind and solar collection farms  are typically located in remote areas  consequently significant investment in new transmission lines will be required to connect this power to the electrical grid and to transport this power to more populated or industrial areas with higher demand 
for example  in july  the texas public utility commission approved the investment of approximately billion for the construction of electric transmission lines to carry power generated by new wind farms in remote western and northern parts of state to major population and industrial centers in texas 
while the electrical grid reliability continues to deteriorate  demand for electricity is expected to continue to grow 
according to the annual energy outlook published by the us department of energy s energy information administration  or eia  the population of the united states has increased by about since  with energy consumption increasing by a comparable 
additionally  the same eia report projects that total us electricity sales from producers to consumers will increase by from  billion kilowatt hours in to  billion kilowatt hours in north american electric reliability corporation  or nerc  the organization of us electric grid operators  reports in its long term reliability assessment that peak demand for electricity in the us  which typically occurs in the summer  is forecast to 
table of contents increase by  megawatts or over the next ten years 
the stimulus act allocates billion in funds for modernization and expansion of the nation s electrical grid 
nerc projects the number of transmission miles will increase by or  circuit miles in the us over the next ten years 
we believe spending levels will continue to increase as utilities work to address infrastructure maintenance requirements  as well as the future reliability standards required by the energy policy act of  or the energy act 
increased production and demand for natural gas 
natural gas is one of the cleanest burning hydrocarbon fuels and is in demand due to its relative cost advantage over other fossil fuel sources 
the level of natural gas pipeline construction activity in the united states is expected to increase substantially through according to a report published in july by eia  approximately gas pipeline projects  estimated to cost approximately billion  are already being planned or have been approved by us regulatory authorities 
in addition  the development of a number of proposed new liquefied natural gas import facilities along the coastline of the united states  as well as some in canada and mexico  if realized  likely will continue to spark new pipeline proposals 
demand for increased wireless and wired voice  video and data services 
demand for faster and more robust voice  video and data services has increased significantly with the proliferation of the internet  broadband  video and music download services  high definition television and other advanced video services 
to serve this developing market and the ever increasing need for more bandwidth  voice  video and data for fixed and mobile devices  service providers are upgrading the performance of their wired and wireless networks or deploying new competing networks using new technologies such as worldwide interoperability for microwave access  or wimax 
investment is facilitated by declining equipment costs and expanded capabilities of wireline and wireless network equipment 
at the same time  major regional and rural telecommunication companies are upgrading their networks from copper line to fiber optic line in order to enhance their ability to provide customers with bundled services that include video  voice and data 
similar dynamics of providers seeking to improve their offerings are prevalent in the cable and satellite markets as well 
the stimulus act allocates billion for the development of broadband facilities throughout the us and the expansion of broadband access into areas that are currently not served by high speed data networks 
competitive strengths our competitive strengths include diverse customer relationships 
we serve a diversified customer industry base 
our customers include some of the largest contractors  communications  utility and wind farm companies in the united states  including directv  verizon  at t  energy transfer company  tetra tech  m

we have longstanding relationships with many customers  and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from projects performed under service agreements 
we also provide services under master service agreements which are generally multi year agreements 
certain of our master service agreements are exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area 
work performed under master service and other agreements is generated by work orders  each of which is performed for a fixed fee 
the majority of these services are of a maintenance nature and  to a lesser extent  upgrade services 
these master service agreements and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bid basis  although customers may negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re bidding 
our master service agreements and other service agreements have various terms  depending upon the nature of the services provided and are typically subject to termination on short notice 
the remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects that may require the construction and installation of specified units within an infrastructure system or an entire infrastructure system 
customers are billed with varying frequency weekly  monthly or upon attaining specific milestones 
such contracts generally include retainage provisions under which to of the contract price is withheld from us until the work has been completed and accepted by the customer 
we believe that our industry experience  technical expertise and customer service are important to our being retained by large utility and communications companies and governments 
the relationships developed between these customers and our senior management and project management teams are also important to our being retained 
backlog our month backlog was approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  we expect to realize approximately of our backlog in approximately of our backlog at december  was comprised of services to be performed under existing master service agreements and long term contracts 
the balance is our estimate of work to be completed on other service agreements 
see item a 
risk factors amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits

total outstanding letters of credit amounted to million and cash collateral posted amounted to million at december  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates insurance reserves 
suppliers  materials and working capital under many of our contracts  our customers supply the necessary materials and supplies and we are responsible for installation  but not for material costs or material warranties 
under certain of our contracts we acquire materials and supplies for our own account from third party providers 
we are not dependent on any one supplier for materials or supplies and have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of materials and supplies 
we utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage work flow 
our independent contractors are typically sole proprietorships or small business entities that provide their own vehicles  tools and insurance coverage 
we are not dependent on any single independent contractor 
see item a 
risk factors we may choose  or be required  to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay  or delay paying  us for the related services 

table of contents we need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business  primarily due to the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work  including storm restoration work  and the corresponding spending by our customers on their annual capital expenditure budgets 
our business is typically slower in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year and stronger in the second and third quarters 
we generally experience seasonal working capital needs from approximately april through september to support growth in unbilled revenue and accounts receivable  and to a lesser extent  inventory

we maintain inventory to meet the material requirements of some of our contracts 
some of our customers pay us in advance for a portion of the materials we purchase for their projects  or allow us to pre bill them for materials purchases up to a specified amount 
competition our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
we often compete with a number of companies in markets where we operate  ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms 
the national or large regional firms that compete with us include quanta services  inc  pike electric  inc  ma mortenson company  ma blattner sons  inc  and dycom industries  inc 
relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
some of our customers employ personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide 
we compete based upon our industry experience  technical expertise  financial and operational resources  nationwide presence  industry reputation and customer service 
while we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider  most of their work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected 
see item a 
risk factors our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
regulation we are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally  including laws and regulations related to labor relations  worker safety and environmental protection 
while many of our customers operate in regulated industries for example  utilities regulated by the public service commission or broadband companies regulated by franchise agreements with various municipalities  we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight 
as a contractor  our operations are subject to various laws  including regulations related to vehicle registrations  including those of state and the united states departments of transportation  regulations related to worker safety and health  including those established by the occupational safety and health administration  contractor licensing requirements  building and electrical codes  and permitting and inspection requirements 
we are also subject to various environmental laws 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
for example  some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 

table of contents we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
see item a 
risk factors our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
we believe we have all licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in compliance with all material applicable regulatory requirements

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our industry and our customers industries the current credit crisis and economic downturn could reduce capital expenditures in the industries we serve  which may result in a decrease in demand for our services 
the demand for our services has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the us economy 
given the recent financial market turmoil and tightening of credit  our customers may have difficulty in obtaining financing  which may result in cancellations of projects or deferral of projects to a later date 
such cancellations or deferrals could result in decreased demand for our services and could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
in addition  our customers are affected by economic downturns that decrease the need for their services or the profitability of their services 
slow downs in real estate  fluctuations in commodity prices and decreased demand by end customers for higher value services could affect our customers and their capital expenditure plans 
because we have been negatively impacted by previous economic downturns  we constantly monitor our customers industries and their relative health compared to the economy as a whole 
the recent reduction in new housing starts  for example  could negatively impact our customers who utilize our services to construct their last mile of communications infrastructure  as well as other industries we serve  including electric utility transmission and grid connection  water and sewer and natural gas pipeline construction 
additionally  our customers who provide satellite and broadband communications to consumers across the country could be adversely impacted by an economic downturn if new subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumers are not ordered at the rate 
table of contents that we and our customers anticipate 
during an economic downturn  our customers also may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure at their current levels or may determine to outsource less work 
a decrease in any of these projects  new subscriptions and upgrades or any other services we provide could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
many of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change  and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demand for our services 
we derive  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the communications and utilities industries 
the communications and utilities industries are subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation 
changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide 
for example  new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for the transmission of voice  video and data  and improvements in existing technology may allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
technological advances may also result in lower costs for sources of energy  which may render existing wind energy projects and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
additionally  both the communications and utilities industries have been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers 
our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are developed in any of the industries we serve or the consolidation of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our industry is highly competitive  which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
our industry is highly fragmented  and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate  ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets 
we also face competition from existing or prospective customers that employ in house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors 
most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected  especially on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements 
if we are unsuccessful in bidding on these projects  or if our ability to win such projects requires that we accept lesser margins  then our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers  and the loss of one of these customers or a reduction in their demand for our services could impair our financial performance 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  at t and verizon  and respectively 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  at t and verizon  respectively 
in addition  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately   and of our revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers  our revenue could significantly decline if we lose one or more of these customers or if the amount of business we obtain from them is reduced  which could result in reduced profitability and liquidity 
our profitability and liquidity could decline if certain customers reduce the amounts they pay for our services or if our customers are unable to pay for our services 
in the past  we incurred significant losses after a number of customers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial difficulties following a general economic downturn and certain industry specific factors that worsened the impact of the overall economic downturn on those customers 
in  and total provisions for bad debts 
table of contents aggregated to million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  resulted from anticipated legal settlements and discontinued operations 
as of december   we had remaining receivables from customers undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling million  of which million is included in specific reserves for bad debts  with the remaining amounts expected to be recovered through secured and unsecured claims and enforcement of liens or bonds 
most of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
under our multi year master service agreements and other service agreements  we contract to provide customers with individual project services  through work orders  within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis 
under these agreements  our customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the projects customers assign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we recorded unrealized losses in and to reduce the carrying value of certain auction rate securities we hold  and we may incur additional impairment charges with respect to auction rate securities in future periods 
the current overall credit concerns in capital markets may affect our ability to liquidate certain securities that we classify as securities available for sale on our balance sheet 
as of december   all of our securities available for sale  or million in par value of auction rate securities  had insufficient bidders at the scheduled rollover dates 
we have recorded an aggregate unrealized loss on these securities of million as of december  our valuation is sensitive to market conditions and management s judgment and can change significantly based on the assumptions used 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
at this time  we are uncertain whether the liquidity issues associated with these investments will improve  when we will be able to exit these investments at their par value or whether we will incur any additional temporary or other than temporary losses as a result of these investments 
as a result of this uncertainty  we have classified the million fair value of these securities to long term assets at december  most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice  so our revenue is not guaranteed 
most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice  ranging from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon days notice  even if we are not in default under the contract 
many of our contracts  including our service agreements  are periodically open to public bid 
we may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re bid 
we also provide a significant portion of our services on a non recurring  project by project basis 
we could experience a reduction in our revenue  profitability and liquidity if our customers cancel a significant number of contracts  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 
we may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed price contracts which could impair our financial performance 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master service agreements and other service agreements that are fixed price contracts 
under these contracts  we set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated 
in addition to master or other service agreements we enter into contracts that require installation or construction of specified units within an infrastructure system 
under those agreements  we have also contractually agreed to a price per unit 
profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates 
we are also required 
table of contents to immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated costs on these projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the projects exceed the revenue to be earned on such units 
our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  such as lower than anticipated productivity  conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor 
certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated or losses if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates  which could reduce our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
our failure to properly manage projects may result in additional costs or claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
certain of our engagements involve large scale  complex projects 
the quality of our performance on such a project depends in large part upon our ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources  including third party contractors and our own personnel 
our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees  or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones 
in addition  some of our agreements require that we pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines  therefore  any delay in the completion of projects could subject us to penalties which could further adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
further  any defects or errors  or failures to meet our customers expectations could result in large damage claims against us  and  because of the substantial cost of  and potentially long lead time necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used in our complex projects  particularly our wind farm projects  damage claims may substantially exceed the amount we can charge for our associated services 
we recognize revenue for our installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  therefore  variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability 
we recognize revenue on long term installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs 
the percentage of completion method therefore relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller projects could be material 
we immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact our liquidity 
for example  for the years ended december   and  we incurred approximately million  million and million  respectively  of losses on percentage of completion contracts 
for the year ended december   million was included in loss from discontinued operations 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits 
approximately of our month backlog at december  was composed of master service agreements and other service agreements  none of which require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice 
the balance of our backlog is our estimate of work to be completed on long term installation construction fixed price agreements 
these backlog amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period  or at all 
in addition  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
if our backlog fails to materialize  our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
the budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure services customers end december as a result  some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the year 
adverse weather conditions  particularly during the winter season  also affect our ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the united states 
as a result  we experience reduced revenue in the first quarter of each calendar year 
natural catastrophes such as hurricanes in the united states could also have a negative impact on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions  which could result in a decline in results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
warranty claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we generally warrant the work we perform for a one to two year period following substantial completion of a project  subject to further extensions of the warranty period following repairs or replacements 
we have not historically accrued any reserves for potential warranty claims as they have been immaterial 
the costs associated with such warranties  including any warranty related legal proceedings  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we are self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims  those policies are subject to high deductibles  and we are self insured up to the amount of the deductible 
since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
if our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities  we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity 
increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability  liquidity and availability under our credit facility 
because of factors such as increases in claims  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
an increase in premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity as well as reduce availability under our revolving credit facility 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings  and the need for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility 
some of our contracts require performance and payment bonds 
we may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future  which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certain customers 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the future  we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds which would reduce availability under our credit facility 
the impact of the stimulus act is uncertain 
the credit crisis and economic downturn resulted in a tremendous amount of uncertainty with certain projects being delayed or cancelled 
while we believe that the stimulus act  which was enacted into law in february  should aid the wind  electrical transmission and rural broadband businesses  the extent to which it will is uncertain 

table of contents the stimulus act provides for federal tax incentives applicable to the wind energy industry including an investment tax credit  a us treasury grant program  the production tax credit and accelerated tax depreciation for certain wind assets 
the investment tax credit provides that taxpayers can elect to claim an investment tax credit equal to of the cost of certain qualifying assets in lieu of the production tax credit 
the grant program allows taxpayers that elect to claim the investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit to receive grants from the us treasury equal to the amount of the investment tax credit which grants shall be in lieu of such credit 
the production tax credit currently provides the owner of a us wind facility consisting of the pad  tower  and turbine with a ten year credit against its federal income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity produced at such facility by the owner and sold to unrelated persons during that period 
the accelerated depreciation for wind generation assets provides for a five year depreciable life for these assets  rather than the to year depreciable lives of many non renewable energy assets 
the stimulus act also extends the bonus depreciation deduction for property placed in service in the stimulus act also contains several provisions aimed at improving the us s electrical transmission system in part to facilitate the transfer of renewable energy from rural areas to high demand areas  including billion in funds for renewable energy and transmission loan guarantees 
the stimulus act also provides for billion in funds for the development of broadband facilities throughout the united states 
there are  however  many uncertainties surrounding how these provisions of the stimulus act will be implemented and their effectiveness and we also cannot guarantee you that we will be able to secure additional work as a result of the stimulus act 
the tax incentives provided by the stimulus act  however  have a finite term 
currently  the election to claim the investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit is only available for qualified wind facilities placed in service from to  the us treasury grant program will only be applicable to wind projects placed in service in or or after so long as construction begins in or and is completed before  and the production tax credit is scheduled to expire on december  and will not be available for energy generated from wind facilities placed in service after that date unless extended or renewed 
we cannot assure you that the new investment tax credit or us treasury grant program will be effective or that any future efforts to extend or renew the production tax credit  the investment tax credit  or the us treasury grant program will be successful or that any extension or renewal will be on terms that are as favorable as those that currently exist 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any extension or renewal of the production tax credit  the investment tax credit  or the us treasury grant program would be enacted prior to its expiration or  if allowed to expire  that any extension or renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive effect 
we also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for accelerated depreciation of wind generation assets will not be modified  amended or repealed in the future 
the ability of our customers to obtain financing for these wind farm developments would be impaired or eliminated and the resulting wind farms would be less profitable thereby potentially reducing demand for our wind power services if the investment tax credit or the department of energy grant program are not effective or if the federal production tax credit is not extended or renewed  or is extended or renewed at a lower rate 
this ability may be further impaired or eliminated if the investment tax credit or the us treasury grant program in not extended or renewed  or is extended or renewed at a lower rate 
our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if demand for our wind power services were reduced 
changes to renewable portfolio standards could negatively impact our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
a significant portion of our business is currently focused on providing services to owners and operators of wind power facilities 
the development of wind facilities is highly dependent upon the federal production tax credit discussed above and the existence of renewable portfolio standards and other state incentives 
renewable portfolio standards are state specific statutory provisions specifying that electric utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources or devote a certain portion of its plant capacity to renewable energy sources 
additionally  certified renewable energy generators earn certificates for every unit of electricity they produce and can sell these along with their electricity to supply companies 
these standards have spurred significant growth in the wind energy industry and a corresponding increase in the demand for our wind power related services 
currently  states in the united states as well as the district of columbia have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals 
eliminations of or changes to existing renewable portfolio standards may impact the demand for our wind power related services 

table of contents we have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state department of transportation related projects and assets that were sold in february effective february   we sold our state department of transportation related projects and assets 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer of our state department of transportation projects and assets to settle previously disclosed warranty  indemnification and other claims primarily relating to work we had performed on the state department of transportation projects we sold 
in connection with the settlement agreement  the parties also agreed to further amend and restate the amended asset purchase agreement effective as of january   which we refer to as the revised amended agreement 
in connection with the sale of our state department of transportation related projects and assets and the related settlement  we agreed to keep certain liabilities  mainly related to the cost to maintain and continue certain performance and payment bonds  certain obligations under leases between the parties and certain other litigation matters 
we may also be unable to recover any losses we incur as a result of any third party claims to the extent any third parties seek payment from us directly and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification obligations contained in the revised amended agreement  including  in the event the buyer were financially unable to meet certain obligations  any losses resulting from creditor claims 
under the terms of the revised amended agreement  the buyer is no longer required to issue a standby letter of credit in our favor in february to cover any remaining exposure related to our bonded obligations 
instead  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the buyer entered into indemnity agreements directly with certain surety bonding companies in connection with our bonded obligations 
therefore  if the buyer is unable to meet its contractual obligations  the surety bonding company can seek its remedies under the indemnity agreement 
if the surety bonding company  however  pays the amounts due under the bonds  the surety bonding company will seek reimbursement of such payment from us 
accordingly  we may incur losses in the future related to these contingent liabilities if the buyer does not complete the bonded contracts and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in the revised amended agreement 
at december   we estimated that the remaining cost to complete these state department of transportation projects was million on the related million in performance and payment bonds 
we may incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities which could harm our profitability 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 we periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying values exceed the fair market value 
in connection with our decision to sell substantially all our canadian net assets  we wrote off goodwill associated with this entity in the amount of million for the year ended december  when we acquire a business  we record goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire 
as a result of the acquisitions we completed during the years ended december  and  we have recorded million and million  respectively  of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets in connection with acquisitions and payments of earn outs made during those periods 
we expect to continue to record additions to goodwill in future periods in connection with these acquisitions  particularly as a result of future earn out payments  and future acquisitions 
we may incur additional impairment charges related to goodwill in connection with any of our acquisitions in the future if the markets they serve or their business deteriorate 
we may incur restructuring or impairment charges which could reduce our profitability 
from time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability 
we could incur charges in the future as a result of eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy  reducing or eliminating services that do not produce adequate revenue or margin  reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but need margin improvements  and reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources 

table of contents for example  as a result of the sale of our state department of transportation operations  we recorded impairment charges totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all charges related to restructuring or impairment would be reflected as operating expenses and could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity 
our revolving credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
at december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due february we also have a revolving credit facility under which we had million outstanding cash draws at december  we amended and restated our revolving credit facility effective july  and expanded the maximum available borrowing from million to million  subject to certain restrictions 
at december   the availability under the credit facility was approximately million net of outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating million 
the terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders 
the prohibited actions include  among other things buying back shares in excess of specified amounts  making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts  paying cash dividends  creating certain liens against our assets  prepaying our other indebtedness  excluding the senior notes  engaging in certain mergers or combinations  and engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control as defined in the credit facility and indenture 
our credit facility requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility  we would be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source of financing to continue to operate our business 
a default could result in the acceleration of either our obligations under the credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior notes  or both 
in addition  these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
our business is capital intensive and  to the extent we need additional financing  we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms  which may materially decrease our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees  we will be unable to operate efficiently which could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our business is labor intensive  and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover 
in addition  given the nature of the highly specialized work we perform  many of our employees are trained in and possess specialized technical skills 
at times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve  it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel 
we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilled labor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy 
our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses if we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills 
additionally  our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management 
labor shortages  increased labor or training costs or the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins 
the price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing 
accordingly  any increase in fuel costs could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity 
our subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties  or we may be unable to maintain these relationships  either of which may have a material adverse affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we depend on subcontractors to complete some of the work on some of our projects 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor  customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract 
in addition  if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies and or perform the agreed upon services  then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized 
in addition  the absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts 
any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we may choose  or be required  to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay  or delay paying  us for the related services 
we use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow 
in some cases  we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services 
if we choose  or are required  to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay  or delay paying us for the related work  we could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
in addition  new environmental laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material negative impact our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
the occupational safety and health act of  as amended  or osha  establishes certain employer responsibilities  including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury  compliance with standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration and various record keeping  disclosure and procedural requirements 
various standards  including standards for notices of 
table of contents hazards  safety in excavation and demolition work  may apply to our operations 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations and could incur penalties and fines in the future  including in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
we have  from time to time  received notice from the us department of transportation that our motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges 
if we cannot successfully resolve these issues  our ability to service our customers could be damaged which could lead to a material reduction of our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our financial results are based  in part  upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the revenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  allowance for doubtful accounts  accrued self insured claims  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  including amortization of intangibles  the fair value of securities available for sale and accounting for performance based stock awards  income taxes including net deferred tax assets and other contingencies and litigation 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition 
construction projects undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines  pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials  heavy equipment  mechanical failures  transportation accidents  adverse weather conditions and damage to equipment and property 
these hazards can cause personal injuries and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations and large damage claims which could  in some cases  substantially exceed the amount we charge for the associated services 
in addition  if serious accidents or fatalities occur or our safety record were to deteriorate  we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining other new contracts  and certain existing contracts could be terminated 
in addition  our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus 
see risk factors our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
the occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities  employee turnover  increase the costs of our projects or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers  which could materially reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
many of our customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contracting services and the profitability of those services 
many of our communications customers are regulated by the federal communications commission  or fcc  and our energy customers are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc  and  in addition  our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions 
these agencies may interpret the application of their regulations in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations 
if existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide  then demand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced 

table of contents claims  lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  consequential damages or injunctive or declaratory relief 
in addition  pursuant to our service agreements  we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide thereunder 
claimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs 
when appropriate  we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information  legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage  and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to case developments 
if our reserves are inadequate  or if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity 
an adverse determination on any such claim  lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
we have made  and in the future plan to make  strategic acquisitions such as our recent acquisition of wanzek construction  inc  our largest strategic acquisition to date 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of our lenders and therefore not be able to complete such acquisitions 
we may pay for acquisitions with our common stock or convertible securities which may dilute your investment in our common stock or decide to pursue acquisitions that investors may not agree with 
in connection with most of our acquisitions  we have also agreed to substantial earn out arrangements 
to the extent we defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition through a cash earn out arrangement  it will reduce our cash flows in subsequent periods 
in addition  acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business  increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition  the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties  the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs  diversion of management s attention  and the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations 
a failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with or resulting from acquisitions could result in a reduction of our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
borrowings or issuances of convertible securities associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms 
our inability to enforce non competition agreements with former principals and key management of the businesses we acquire may adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
in connection with our acquisitions  we generally require that key management and the former principals of the businesses we acquire enter into non competition agreements in our favor 
the laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of non competition agreements 
generally  state courts will examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a non competition agreement  consequently  we cannot predict with certainty whether  if challenged  a court will enforce any particular non competition agreement 
if one or more former principals or members of key management of the businesses we acquire leave us and the courts refuse to enforce the non compete agreement entered into by such person or persons  we might be subject to increased competition  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents risks related to our company and our common stock the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during  and  our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share 
we may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock 
numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock  including announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors  future sales of our common stock or other securities including any shares issued in connection with earn out obligations for any past or future acquisition  announcements of new contracts or customers by us or one of our competitors  market conditions for providers of services to communications companies  utilities and government  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  and announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and cause you to lose some or all of your investment in our common stock 
in connection with certain completed acquisitions  we have issued shares of our common stock or securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock or have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash as consideration for future earn out obligations  and we may agree to issue such additional securities in connection with other future acquisitions  which  if issued  would dilute your share ownership and could lead to volatility in our common stock price 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
in connection with certain completed acquisitions  we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash for certain earn out obligations  provided we first register those shares for resale  including one such obligation for which our earn out obligation is unlimited 
in addition  in connection with our acquisition of wanzek we issued million shares and million in principal amount of convertible notes and granted the sellers certain registration rights 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that we may issue up to a total  shares of common stock  of which  shares were outstanding as of december  we may also agree to issue additional securities in connection with future acquisitions 
such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price 
a small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions 
jorge mas  our chairman  jose mas  our president and chief executive officer  and other members of the mas family who are employed by mastec  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of december  accordingly  they are in a position to influence the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the nomination of individuals to our board of directors  and a change in our control 
these factors may discourage  delay or prevent a takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest or that might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock 

table of contents our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of florida law contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws and the florida business corporation act  or the fbca  could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
consequently  it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including by the grant of voting control to others  which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control
