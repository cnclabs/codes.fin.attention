geographic information for financial information with respect to each of our geographic areas  see note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item of this annual report 
traffic rail traffic shipped on our rail lines can be categorized as interline  local or overhead traffic 
interline traffic either originates or terminates with customers located along a rail line and is interchanged with other rail carriers 
local traffic both originates and terminates on the same rail line and does not involve other carriers 
overhead traffic passes over the line from one connecting rail carrier to another without the carload originating or terminating on the line 
unlike overhead traffic  interline and local traffic provide us with a more stable source of revenue  because this traffic represents shipments to and or from customers located along our rail lines and is less susceptible to competition from other rail routes or other modes of transportation 
in  revenues generated from interline and local traffic constituted approximately of our freight revenues 
seasonality of operations typically  we experience relatively lower revenues in the first and fourth quarters of each year as the winter season and colder weather in north america tend to reduce shipments of certain products such as construction materials 
in addition  due to adverse winter weather conditions  we also tend to incur higher operating costs during the first and fourth quarters 
we typically initiate capital projects in north america in the second and third quarters when weather conditions are more favorable 
employees as of december   our railroads and industrial switching locations had  full time employees 
of this total  railroad employees are members of national labor organizations 
our railroads have contracts with these national labor organizations  six of which are currently in negotiation 
we also entered into 
table of contents employee association agreements with an additional employees who are not represented by a national labor organization 
the railway labor act rla governs the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in the united states 
the rla establishes the right of railroad employees to organize and bargain collectively along craft or class lines and imposes a duty upon carriers and their employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain collective bargaining agreements 
le code canadian du travail and the federal workplace relations act govern the labor relations of employers and employees engaged in the railroad industry in canada and australia  respectively 
the rla and foreign labor regulations contain detailed procedures that must be exhausted before a lawful work stoppage may occur 
in the netherlands  rrf is not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
safety our safety program involves all employees and focuses on the prevention of accidents and injuries 
operating personnel are trained and certified in train operations  the transportation of hazardous materials  safety and operating rules and governmental rules and regulations 
we also participate in safety committees of the aar  governmental and industry sponsored safety programs and the american short line and regional railroad association safety committee 
our reportable injury frequency ratio  which is defined by the federal railroad administration fra as reportable injuries per  man hours worked  was and in and  respectively 
insurance we maintain liability and property insurance coverage 
our primary liability policies have self insured retentions of up to million per occurrence 
in addition  we maintain excess liability policies that provide supplemental coverage for losses in excess of our primary policy limits 
with respect to the transportation of hazardous commodities  our liability policy covers sudden releases of hazardous materials  including expenses related to evacuation 
personal injuries associated with grade crossing accidents are also covered under our liability policies 
our property damage policies have self insured retentions generally ranging from million to million  depending on the category of incident 
employees of our united states railroads are covered by the federal employers liability act fela  a fault based system under which claims resulting from injuries and deaths of railroad employees are settled by negotiation or litigation 
fela related claims are covered under our liability insurance policies 
employees of our industrial switching business are covered under workers compensation policies 
employees of our canadian railroads are covered by the applicable provincial workers compensation policy 
employees of gwa are covered by the respective state based workers compensation legislation 
employees of rrf are covered by the workers compensation legislation of the netherlands 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate in light of our experience and the experience of the rail industry 

table of contents competition each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers 
however  in certain circumstances  including under the open access regimes in australia and the netherlands  our customers have access to other rail carriers 
in addition  our railroads compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally highway competition from motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged and the transit time required  as well as the quality and reliability of the service provided 
most of the freight we handle is interchanged with other railroads prior to reaching its final destination 
as a result  to the extent other rail carriers are involved in transporting a shipment  we cannot necessarily control the cost and quality of such service 
to the extent highway competition is involved  the effectiveness of that competition is affected by government policy with respect to fuel and other taxes  highway tolls and permissible truck sizes and weights 
to a lesser degree  we also face competition with similar products made in other areas  a kind of competition commonly known as geographic competition 
for example  a paper producer may choose to increase or decrease production at a specific plant served by one of our railroads depending on the relative competitiveness of that plant versus paper plants in other locations 
in some instances  we face product competition  where commodities we transport are exposed to competition from substitutes 
in acquiring rail properties  we generally compete with other short line and regional railroad operators  and more recently with various financial institutions  including private equity firms  operating in conjunction with short line rail operators 
competition for rail properties is based primarily upon price and the seller s assessment of the buyer s railroad operating expertise and financing capability 
we believe our established reputation as a successful acquirer and operator of short line rail properties  combined with our managerial and financial resources  effectively positions us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities 
regulation united states in addition to environmental laws  securities laws  state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to many businesses  our united states railroads are subject to regulation by the stb  the fra  the united states department of transportation dot  federal agencies  including the transportation security administration tsa  which operates under the department of homeland security dhs  state departments of transportation  and some state and local regulatory agencies 
the stb is the successor to certain regulatory functions previously administered by the interstate commerce commission icc 
established by the icc termination act of  the stb has jurisdiction over  among other things  certain freight rates where there is no effective competition  extension or abandonment of rail lines  the acquisition of rail lines and consolidation  merger or acquisition of control of rail common carriers 
in limited circumstances  the stb may condition its approval of an acquisition upon the acquirer of a railroad agreeing to provide severance benefits to certain subsequently terminated employees 
the fra and dot have jurisdiction over safety  which includes the regulation of equipment standards  track maintenance  handling of hazardous shipments  locomotive and rail car inspection  repair requirements  operating practices and crew qualifications 
the tsa has broad authority over railroad operating practices that have implications for homeland security 
in some cases  state and local laws and regulations may be preempted in their application to railroads by the operation of these and other federal authorities 

table of contents canada st 
lawrence atlantic railroad quebec is a federally regulated railroad and falls under the jurisdiction of the canada transportation agency cta and transport canada tc and is subject to the railway safety act 
the cta regulates construction and operation of federally regulated railways  financial transactions of federally regulated railway companies  all aspects of rates  tariffs and services and the transferring and discontinuing of the operation of railway lines 
tc administers the railway safety act  which ensures that federally regulated railway companies abide by all regulations with respect to engineering standards governing the construction or alteration of railway works and the operation and maintenance standards of railway works and equipment 
quebec gatineau railway and huron central railway are subject to the jurisdiction of the provincial governments of quebec and ontario  respectively 
provincially regulated railways operate only within one province and hold a certificate of fitness delivered by a provincial authority 
in the province of quebec  the fitness certificate is delivered by the minist re des transports du quebec  while in ontario  under the shortline railways act   a license must be obtained from the registrar of shortline railways 
construction  operation and discontinuance of operation are regulated  as are railway services 
acquisitions of additional railroad operations in canada  whether federally or provincially regulated  may be subject to review under the investment canada act ica  a federal statute that applies to the acquisition of a canadian business or establishment of a new canadian business by a non canadian 
in the case of an acquisition that is subject to review  a non canadian investor must observe a statutory waiting period prior to completion and satisfy the minister responsible for the administration of the ica that the investment will be of net benefit to canada  considering certain evaluative factors set out in the legislation 
any contemplated acquisitions may also be subject to canada s competition act  which contains provisions relating to pre merger notification as well as substantive merger provisions 
australia in australia  regulation of rail safety is generally governed by state legislation and administered by state regulatory agencies 
gwa s assets are subject to the regulatory regimes governing safety in each of the states in which it operates 
regulation of track access is governed by overriding federal legislation with state based regimes operating in compliance with the federal legislation 
as a result  with respect to rail infrastructure access  gwa s australian assets are also subject to state based access regimes and part iiia of the trade practices act gwa s interstate access includes the standard gauge tracks in south australia which are part of the standard gauge network connecting the state capital cities of perth  adelaide  melbourne  sydney and brisbane 
the majority of interstate network access is controlled by the australian rail track corporation  owned by the commonwealth of australia 
freightlink pty ltd provides network access for the standard gauge tracks operating between tarcoola  south australia to darwin  northern territory 
netherlands in the netherlands  we are subject to regulation by the ministry of transport  public works and water management  the transport  public works and water management inspectorate and the dutch railways manager  pro rail 
in addition  at the european level  several directives have been issued concerning the transportation of goods by railway 
these directives generally cover the development of the railways  allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and the licensing of railway undertakings 
the european union eu legislation also sets a framework for a harmonised approach to railway safety 
every 
table of contents railway company must obtain a safety certification before it can run trains on the european network and eu member states must set up national railway safety authorities and independent accident investigation bodies 
these directives have been implemented in dutch railway legislation such as the railways act 
the dutch competition authority dca is charged with the supervision of compliance with the european community s directives on the development of the railways  the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure 
environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
in the united states  these environmental laws and regulations  which are implemented principally by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies  govern the management of hazardous wastes  the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the manufacture and disposal of certain substances 
similarly  in canada  these functions are administered at the federal level by environment canada and the ministry of transport and comparable agencies at the provincial level 
in australia  these functions are administered primarily by the department of transport at the federal level and by environmental protection agencies at the state level 
in the netherlands  national laws regulating the protection of the environment are administered by the ministry of housing  spatial planning and the environment and authorities at the provincial and municipal level  while laws regulating the transportation of hazardous substances are primarily administered by the ministry of transport  public works and water management 
the commonwealth of australia has acknowledged that certain portions of the leasehold and freehold land acquired from them contain contamination arising from activities associated with previous operators 
the commonwealth has carried out certain remediation work to meet existing south australian environmental standards 
there are no material environmental claims currently pending or  to our knowledge  threatened against us or any of our railroads 
in addition  we believe our railroads operate in material compliance with current environmental laws and regulations 
we estimate any expenses incurred in maintaining compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or capital expenditures 
discontinued operations in october  our mexican subsidiary  compa a de ferrocarriles chiapas mayab  sa de sa fccm  was struck by hurricane stan which destroyed or damaged approximately bridges and washed out segments of track in the state of chiapas between the town of tonal and the guatemalan border  rendering approximately miles of rail line inoperable 
we believe the mexican government had the obligation to fund the reconstruction plan for the damaged portion of the rail line 
on june   fccm formally notified the mexican secretaria de comunicaciones y transportes sct of its intent to exercise its right to resign its year concession from the mexican government and to cease its rail operations 
the decision to cease fccm s operations was made on june   and was due to the failure of the mexican government to fulfill its obligation to fund the chiapas reconstruction 
without reconstruction of the hurricane damaged line  fccm was not a viable business 
during the third quarter of  fccm ceased its rail operations and initiated formal liquidation proceedings 
there were no remaining employees of fccm as of september  the sct has contested the resignation of the concession and has seized substantially all of fccm s operating assets in response to the resignation 
additional information on the sct s claims is set forth under item legal proceedings mexico 

table of contents in november  we entered into an amended agreement to sell of the share capital of fccm to viablis  sa de sa viablis for a sale price of approximately million 
completion of the sale transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  as well as the final negotiation with viablis and the sct of a mutually acceptable transfer of the concession granted by the mexican government to viablis and related undertakings 
it is not yet possible to determine when or if these closing conditions will be satisfied 
results of our mexican operations are included in results from discontinued operations

table of contents item a 
risk factors our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks that could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed or forecast in our forward looking statements  including the risks described below and the risks that may be identified in future documents that are filed or furnished with the sec 
general risks associated with our business adverse macroeconomic and business conditions could negatively impact our business 
economic activity in the united states and throughout the world has undergone a sudden  sharp downturn 
global financial markets have and could continue to experience unprecedented volatility and disruption 
certain of our customers and suppliers are directly affected by the economic downturn  are facing credit issues and could experience cash flow problems that have and could continue to give rise to payment delays  increased credit risk  bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our rail services 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could also affect our costs for insurance and our ability to acquire and maintain adequate insurance coverage for risks associated with the railroad business if insurance companies experience credit downgrades or bankruptcies 
changes in governmental banking  monetary and fiscal policies to stimulate the economy  restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective 
it is difficult to determine the depth and duration of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may impact our customers  suppliers and our business in general 
moreover  given the asset intensive nature of our business  the economic downturn increases the risk of significant asset impairment charges since we are required to assess for potential impairment of non current assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  including economic circumstances  indicate that the respective asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
continuation or further worsening of current macroeconomic and financial conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
if we are unable to consummate additional acquisitions or investments  then we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully 
our growth strategy is based to a large extent on the selective acquisition and development of  and investment in  rail properties  both in new regions and in regions in which we currently operate 
the success of this strategy will depend on  among other things the availability of suitable opportunities  the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources  our ability to value acquisition and investment opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those acquisitions and investments  our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners  and the availability of management resources to oversee the integration and operation of the new businesses 
if we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy  the market price for our class a common stock may be adversely affected 
we may need additional capital to fund our acquisitions 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital at a reasonable cost  then we may forego potential acquisitions  which would impair the execution of our growth strategy 
since january   we have acquired interests in railroads  the majority of which were purchased for cash 
as of december   we had undrawn revolver capacity of million and million of cash and cash equivalents available for acquisitions or other activities 
we intend to continue to review acquisition 
table of contents candidates and potential purchases of railroad assets and to attempt to acquire companies and assets that meet our investment criteria 
we expect that  as in the past  we will pay cash for some or all of the purchase price of any acquisitions or purchases that we make 
depending on the number of acquisitions or purchases and the prices thereof  we may not generate enough cash from operations to pay for the acquisitions or purchases 
we may  therefore  need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our acquisitions 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions and costs on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the global financial markets have been and may continue to be constrained and may not be a source of additional capital 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  then we may forego potential acquisitions  which could impair the execution of our growth strategy 
our inability to acquire or integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits could have adverse consequences to our business 
we have experienced significant growth through acquisitions and we expect to continue to grow through additional acquisitions 
evaluating acquisition targets gives rise to additional costs related to legal  financial  operating and industry due diligence 
acquisitions generally result in increased operating and administrative costs and  to the extent financed with debt  additional interest costs 
we may not be able to manage or integrate the acquired companies or businesses successfully 
the process of acquiring businesses may be disruptive to our business and may cause an interruption or reduction of our business as a result of the following factors  among others loss of key employees or customers  possible inconsistencies in or conflicts between standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement company wide financial  accounting  information technology and other systems  failure to maintain the quality of services that have historically been provided  integrating employees of rail lines acquired from other entities into our regional railroad culture  failure to coordinate geographically diverse organizations  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day business as a result of the need to manage any disruptions and difficulties and the need to add management resources to do so 
these disruptions and difficulties  if they occur  may cause us to fail to realize the cost savings  revenue enhancements and other benefits that we expect to result from integrating acquired companies and may cause material adverse short and long term effects on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if we are able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize the full benefits of the cost savings  revenue enhancements or other benefits that we may have expected at the time of acquisition 
the expected revenue enhancements and cost savings are based on analyses completed by members of our management 
these analyses necessarily involve assumptions as to future events  including general business and industry conditions  the longevity of specific customer plants and factories served  operating costs and competitive factors  most of which are beyond our control and may not materialize 
while we believe these analyses and their underlying assumptions to be reasonable  they are estimates that are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  even if we achieve the expected benefits  we may not be able to achieve them within the anticipated time frame 
also  the cost savings and other synergies from these acquisitions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies  increases in other expenses or problems in the business unrelated to these acquisitions 
many of our recent acquisitions have involved the purchase of stock of existing companies 
these acquisitions  as well as acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of a company may expose us to liability for actions taken by an acquired business and its management before our acquisition 
the due diligence we conduct 
table of contents in connection with an acquisition and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient to protect us from  or compensate us for  actual liabilities 
generally  the representations made by the sellers  other than certain representations related to fundamental matters  such as ownership of capital stock  expire several years after closing 
a material liability associated with an acquisition  especially where there is no right to indemnification  could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
our credit facilities and note purchase agreements contain numerous covenants that impose certain restrictions on the way we operate our business 
our credit facilities contain numerous covenants that impose restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  create liens on our assets  make certain types of investments  repurchase shares or pay dividends  make expenditures for capital projects  merge or consolidate with others  make asset acquisitions other than in the ordinary course of business  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
our credit facilities also contain financial covenants that require us to meet a number of financial ratios and tests 
our failure to comply with the obligations in our credit facilities could result in an increase in our interest expense and could give rise to events of default under the credit facilities  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of our indebtedness  allowing our senior lenders to foreclose on our assets 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties and their failure to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to credit risk 
there is a risk that a customer or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations when due 
customers and counterparties that owe us money have defaulted and may continue to default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
we have procedures for reviewing our receivables and credit exposures to specific customers and counterparties  however  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
some of our risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  customers or other matters that are not publicly available or otherwise accessible by us and this information may not  in all cases  be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
as a result  unexpected credit exposures could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the loss of important customers or contracts may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our operations served more than customers in freight revenue from our largest freight revenue customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues in as of december   four of our 
table of contents largest customers operated in the paper and forest products industry 
in  our largest freight revenue customer was a company in the paper and forest products industry  freight revenue from which accounted for approximately of our total revenues in we typically handle freight pursuant to transportation contracts between us  our connecting carriers and the customer 
these contracts are in accordance with industry norms and vary in duration 
these contracts establish price or  in the case of longer term contracts  a methodology for determining price  but do not typically obligate the customer to move any particular volume and are not typically linked to the prices of the commodities being shipped 
substantial reduction in business with or loss of important customers or contracts has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
because we depend on class i railroads and other connecting carriers for a majority of our operations  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if our relationships with these carriers deteriorate 
the railroad industry in the united states and canada is dominated by seven class i carriers that have substantial market control and negotiating leverage 
in  approximately of our total carloads in the united states and canada were interchanged with class i carriers 
a decision by any of these class i carriers to use alternate modes of transportation  such as motor carriers  or to cease certain freight movements  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the quantitative impact of such a decision would depend on which class i carrier made such a decision and which of our routes and freight movements were affected 
in addition  class i carriers also have traditionally been significant sources of business for us  as well as sources of potential acquisition candidates as they divest branch lines to smaller rail operators  which divestitures are important for the execution of our growth strategy 
our ability to provide rail service to customers in the united states and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to freight rates  revenue divisions  fuel surcharges  car supply  reciprocal switching  interchange and trackage rights 
deterioration in the operations of or service provided by those connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on lease agreements with class i railroads and other third parties for our operations  strategy and growth 
our rail operations are dependent  in part  on lease agreements with class i railroads and third parties  which allow us to operate over certain segments of track critical to our operations 
for instance  we lease several railroads from class i carriers under long term lease arrangements  which collectively accounted for approximately of our revenues 
in addition  we own several railroads that also lease portions of the track or right of way upon which they operate from class i railroads and other third parties 
our ability to provide comprehensive rail services to our customers on the leased lines depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and extend these lease agreements 
expiration or termination of these leases or failure of our railroads to comply with the terms of these leases could result in the loss of operating rights with respect to those rail properties  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we face competition from numerous sources  including those relating to geography  substitute products  other types of transportation and other rail operators 
each of our railroads is typically the only rail carrier directly serving our customers 
however  in certain circumstances  including under the open access regimes in australia and the netherlands  our customers have access to other rail carriers 
in addition  our railroads also compete directly with other modes of transportation  principally motor carriers and  on some routes  ship  barge and pipeline operators 
transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights of way that are built and maintained by governmental entities  
table of contents while we must build and maintain our network 
in addition  other rail operators may build new rail lines to access certain of our customers 
if competition from these alternative methods of transportation or competitors materially increases  or if legislation is passed providing materially greater opportunity for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions  we could suffer a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are also subject to geographic and product competition 
for example  a customer could shift production to a region where we do not have operations or could substitute one commodity for another commodity that is not transported by rail 
in either case  we would lose a source of revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the extent of this competition varies significantly among our railroads 
competition is based primarily upon the rate charged  the relative costs of substitutable products and the transit time required 
in addition  competition is based on the quality and reliability of the service provided 
because a significant portion of our carloads in the united states and canada involve interchange with another carrier  we have only limited control over the total price  transit time or quality of such service 
any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality of these alternative modes of transportation in the locations in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for other modes of transportation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
for information on the competition associated with the open access regimes in europe and australia  see additional risks associated with our foreign operations 
it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of competition on our business  since not only each customer  but also each customer location and each product shipped from such location is subject to different types of competition 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation of our railroad operations 
the failure to comply with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are subject to governmental regulation with respect to our railroad operations and a variety of health  safety  security  labor  environmental and other matters by a significant number of federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
in the united states  these agencies include the stb  the dot  the fra of the dot  other federal agencies including the dhs and state departments of transportation 
in australia  we are subject to both commonwealth and state regulations 
in canada  we are subject to regulation by the cta  tc and the regulatory departments of the provincial governments of quebec and ontario 
in the netherlands  we are subject to regulation by the ministry of transport  public works and water management  the transport  public works and water management inspectorate and the dutch railways manager  pro rail 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
changes to the legislative and regulatory environment  if adopted  could have a significant impact on our railroad operations 
there are various legislative actions being considered in the united states that modify or increase regulatory oversight of the rail industry 
the majority of the actions under consideration and pending are directed at class i railroads  however  specific initiatives recently introduced in congress associated with competition  safety  pricing power  positive train control  security and labor regulations could significantly affect our operations and the cost of compliance with the proposed rules and regulations could be significant 
in addition  proposed and pending regulations may require us to obtain and maintain various licenses  permits and other authorizations  and we may not be able to do so 
federal  state and local regulatory authorities may change the regulatory framework without providing us with any recourse for the adverse effects that the changes may have on our operations 
as a result  changes to legislation and the regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents market and regulatory responses to climate change could adversely affect our operating costs and decrease demand for the commodities we transport 
clean air laws  restrictions  caps  taxes  or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases  including diesel exhaust  could significantly increase our operating costs 
restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that use commodities that we carry to produce energy  use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry  or manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels  including coal fired power plants  chemical producers  farmers and food producers  and automakers and other manufacturers 
significant cost increases  government regulation  or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns  including  for example  the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers 
any of these factors  individually or in conjunction with one or more of the other factors  or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we could incur significant costs for violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
our railroad operations and real estate ownership are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to waters  the handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases 
we may incur environmental liability from conditions or practices at properties previously owned or operated by us  properties leased by us and other properties owned by third parties for example  properties at which hazardous substances or wastes for which we are responsible have been treated  stored  spilled or disposed  as well as at properties currently owned by us 
under some environmental statutes  such liability may be without regard to whether we were at fault and may also be joint and several  whereby we are responsible for all the liability at issue even though we or the entity that gives rise to our liability may be only one of a number of entities whose conduct contributed to the liability 
environmental liabilities may arise from claims asserted by owners or occupants of affected properties or other third parties affected by environmental conditions for example  contractors and current or former employees seeking to recover in connection with alleged damages to their property or with personal injury or death  as well as by governmental authorities seeking to remedy environmental conditions or to enforce environmental obligations 
environmental requirements and liabilities could obligate us to incur significant costs  including significant expenses to investigate and remediate environmental contamination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
rising fuel costs could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses and an increase in fuel costs could have a negative effect on our profitability 
although we receive fuel surcharges and other rate adjustments to offset rising fuel prices  if class i railroads change their policies regarding fuel surcharges  then the compensation we receive for increases in fuel costs may decrease 
fuel costs for fuel used in operations were approximately and of our operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fuel prices and supplies are influenced by factors beyond our control  such as international political and economic circumstances 
if diesel fuel prices increase dramatically or if a fuel supply shortage were to arise from production curtailments  a disruption of oil imports or otherwise  these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets 
we consumed million gallons of diesel fuel in fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations 
if a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments  disruption of oil imports  disruption of domestic refinery production  damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure  political unrest  war or otherwise  our financial position  results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected 
as a common carrier by rail  we are required to transport hazardous materials  regardless of risk 
transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury  property damage and environmental remediation costs and compromise critical parts of our railroads 
in addition  insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or certain coverage may not be available to us in the future if there is a catastrophic event related to rail transportation of these commodities 
in addition  federal regulators have previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials and have the ability to put in place additional regulations 
for instance  recently enacted legislation requires pre notification for hazardous materials shipments 
such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads 
additionally  regulations adopted by the dot and the dhs could significantly increase the costs associated with moving hazardous materials on our railroads 
further  certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders 
such ordinances could require the re routing of hazardous materials shipments  with the potential for significant additional costs 
increases in our costs associated with the transport of hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are either not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we have obtained for each of our railroads insurance coverage for losses arising from personal injury and for property damage in the event of derailments or other accidents or occurrences 
on certain of the rail lines over which we operate  freight trains are commingled with passenger trains 
for instance  in oregon we operate certain passenger trains for the tri county metropolitan transportation district of oregon over our portland western railroad 
unexpected or catastrophic circumstances such as accidents involving passenger trains or spillage of hazardous materials could cause our liability to exceed expected statutory limits  third party insurance limits and our insurance limits 
insurance is available from only a very limited number of insurers  and we may not be able to obtain insurance protection at our current levels or obtain it on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  subsequent adverse events directly and indirectly applicable to us may result in additional increases in our insurance premiums and or our self insured retentions and could result in limitations to the coverage under our existing policies 
the occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are not covered by insurance or that exceed our insurance limits could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
some of our employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions in the united states  australia and canada 
in north america  we are party to contracts with national labor organizations 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with respect to six of those agreements 
we have also entered into employee association agreements with an additional employees who are not represented by a national labor organization 
gwa has a collective enterprise bargaining agreement covering the majority of its employees 
our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
if the unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized  or the terms and conditions in future labor 
table of contents agreements were renegotiated  then we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and or higher ongoing labor costs  which  in either case  could materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
to date  we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages 
we are also subject to the risk of the unionization of our non unionized employees  which risk could increase if pro union legislation currently under consideration is adopted 
additional unionization of our workforce could result in higher employee compensation and restrictive working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
in addition  work interruptions may be threatened  which could cause customers to seek other transportation alternatives  with a corresponding adverse financial impact 
if we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers  then our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our success and our growth depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled workers that possess the ability to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities 
the operation and maintenance of our equipment and facilities involve complex and specialized processes and often must be performed in harsh conditions  resulting in a high employee turnover rate when compared to many other industries 
the challenge of attracting and retaining the necessary workforce is increased by the expected retirement of an aging workforce and significant competition for specialized trades 
within the next five years  we estimate approximately of the current workforce will become eligible for retirement 
many of these workers hold key operating positions  such as conductors  engineers and mechanics 
in addition  the demand for workers with the types of skills we require has increased  especially from class i railroads  which can usually offer higher wages and better benefits 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
if any of these events were to occur  then our cost structure could increase  our margins could decrease and our growth potential could be impaired  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our operations are dependent on our ability to obtain railcars  locomotives and other critical railroad items from suppliers 
due to the capital intensive nature and industry specific requirements of the rail industry  there are high barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as railcars  locomotives and track materials 
if the number of available railcars is insufficient or if the cost of obtaining these railcars increases  then we might not be able to obtain replacement railcars on favorable terms  or at all  and shippers may seek alternate forms of transportation 
in addition  in some cases we use third party locomotives to provide transportation services to our customers 
without these third party locomotives  we would need to invest additional capital in locomotives 
additionally  we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials  such as rail and ties 
changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or material shortages that could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures 
the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment  personal injury  freight loss and other property damage and other matters 
for example  united states job related personal injury claims are subject to fela  which is applicable only to railroads 
fela s fault based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no fault worker s compensation system 
the variability inherent in this system could result in the actual costs of claims being very different from the liability recorded 
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving material freight loss or property damage  personal injury and environmental liability that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents our results of operations are susceptible to severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences 
we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions  including floods  fires  hurricanes  droughts  earthquakes and other natural occurrences 
for example our minerals and stone revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the northeastern united states  which lessen demand for road salt 
our coal  coke and ores revenues may be reduced by mild winters in the midwestern united states  which lessen demand for coal 
gwa s revenues are susceptible to the impact of drought conditions on the south australian grain harvest 
bad weather and natural disasters  such as blizzards in the northeastern united states and canada and hurricanes in the southeastern united states  could cause a shutdown or substantial disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
even if a material adverse weather or other condition does not directly affect our operations  it can impact the operations of our customers or connecting carriers 
such weather conditions could cause our customers or connecting carriers to reduce or suspend their operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
furthermore  our expenses could be adversely impacted by weather  including  for example  higher track maintenance and overtime costs in the winter at our railroads in the northeastern united states and canada related to snow removal and mandated work breaks 
in addition  gwa derives a significant portion of its rail freight revenues from shipments of grain 
for each of the years ended december  and  grain shipments generated approximately of gwi s operating revenues 
a decrease in grain shipments as a result of adverse weather or other negative agricultural conditions could have a material adverse effect on gwa s operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
certain of our capital projects may be impacted by our ability to obtain government funding 
certain of our existing capital projects are  and certain of our future capital projects may be  partially dependent on our ability to obtain government funding 
during  we obtained government funding for separate projects that were partially funded by united states  canada and australia federal  state and municipal agencies 
these funds represented approximately of our total capital expenditures during government funding for our projects is limited  and there is no guarantee that budget pressure at the federal  state and local level or changing governmental priorities will not eliminate future funding availability 
in addition  competition for government funding from other short line railroads  class i railroads and other companies is significant  and the receipt of government funds is often contingent on the acceptance of contractual obligations that may not be strictly profit maximizing 
in certain jurisdictions  the acceptance of government funds may impose additional legal obligations on our operations  such as compliance with prevailing wage requirements 
acts of terrorism or anti terrorism measures may adversely affect us 
our rail lines  port operations and other facilities and equipment  including rail cars carrying hazardous materials that we are required to transport under federal law as a common carrier  could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks 
any terrorist attack or other similar event could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  regulatory measures designed to control terrorism could impose substantial costs upon us and could result in impairment to our service  which could also adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents additional risks associated with our foreign operations we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
some of our significant subsidiaries transact business in foreign countries  namely in australia  canada and the netherlands  and we have a minority investment in bolivia 
in addition  we may consider acquisitions or other investments in other foreign countries in the future 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include adverse renegotiation or modification of existing agreements or arrangements with governmental authorities  adverse changes or greater volatility in the economies of those countries  adverse effects of currency exchange controls  adverse currency movements that make goods produced in those countries that are destined for export markets less competitive  adverse changes to the regulatory environment of those countries  adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations of those countries  restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings  the nationalization of the businesses that we operate  such as threatened nationalization in bolivia  the actual or perceived failure by us to fulfill commitments under concession agreements  the potential instability of foreign governments  including from domestic insurgency  the ability to identify and retain qualified local managers  and the challenge of managing a culturally and geographically diverse operation 
because some of our significant subsidiaries and affiliates transact business in foreign currencies and because a significant portion of our net income comes from the operations of our foreign subsidiaries  future exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect us and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our operations in australia  canada and the netherlands accounted for  and of our consolidated operating revenues  respectively  for the year ended december  the results of operations of our foreign entities are reported in the local currency the australian dollar  the canadian dollar and the euro and then translated into united states dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  any appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against the united states dollar can impact our results of operations 
the exchange rates between these currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future 
for instance  in the year ended december   the australian dollar and canadian dollar depreciated and  respectively  relative to the united states dollar 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our exchange rate risks  and the volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  because our financial statements are stated in united states dollars  such fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
failure to meet concession commitments with respect to operations of our rail lines could result in the loss of our investment and a related loss of revenues 
through our subsidiaries in south australia and unconsolidated minority interest in bolivia  we have entered into long term concession and or lease agreements with governmental authorities in south australia and 
table of contents bolivia 
these concession and lease agreements are subject to a number of conditions  including those relating to the maintenance of certain standards with respect to safety  service  price and the environment 
these concession and lease agreements also typically carry with them a commitment to maintain the condition of the railroad and to make a certain level of capital expenditures 
our failure to meet these commitments under the long term concession and lease agreements could result in the loss of those concession or lease agreements 
the loss of any concession or lease agreement could result in the loss of our entire investment relating to that concession or lease agreement and the related revenues and income 
open access regimes in australia and the netherlands could lead to additional competition for rail services and decreased revenues and profit margins 
the legislative and regulatory framework in australia allows third party rail operators to gain access to gwa s railway infrastructure and also governs gwa s access to track owned by others 
the netherlands also has an open access regime that permits third party rail operators to compete for rrf s business 
there are limited barriers to entry to preclude a current or prospective rail operator from approaching gwa or rrf s customers  and seeking to capture market share 
the loss of gwa or rrf s customers to competitors could result in decreased revenues and profit margins and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
changes to the open access regimes in australia and the netherlands could have a significant impact on our operations 
access charges paid for access onto the track of other companies  and access charges under state and federal regimes are subject to change 
where we pay access fees to others  if those fees were increased  our operating margins could be negatively affected 
in australia  if the federal government or respective state regulators were to alter the regulatory regime or determine that access fees charged to current or prospective third party rail freight operators by gwa did not meet competitive standards  then gwa s income from those fees could decline 
in addition  when gwa and rrf operate over track networks owned by others  the owners of the network are responsible for scheduling the use of the tracks as well as for determining the amount and timing of the expenditures necessary to maintain the tracks in satisfactory condition 
therefore  in areas where we operate over tracks owned by others  our operations are subject to train scheduling set by the owners as well as the risk that the network will not be adequately maintained 
either risk could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
gwa is subject to several contractual restrictions on its ability to compete 
as a result of our june sale of the western australia operations and certain other assets of arg to queensland rail and babcock brown limited arg sale  gwa is subject to a a five year non compete in the state of western australia  the melbourne to adelaide corridor and certain areas within the state of new south wales historically served by arg  b a right of first refusal for the benefit of queensland rail on the sale of i gwa or a majority of the ownership of gwa and ii a number of high horsepower locomotives and intermodal wagons owned or operated by gwa and c a restriction on hiring of arg employees who remain employed by arg after the sale 
these contractual restrictions may place limits on our ability to grow gwa s business or divest of certain assets  which could have a material adverse effect on gwa s operating results  financial condition and liquidity

rail cars by car type owned leased totals box hoppers flats gondolas covered hoppers tank cars maintenance of way crew cars item legal proceedings mexico 
as previously disclosed  on june   fccm formally notified the sct of its intent to exercise its right to resign its year concession from the mexican government and to cease its rail operations 
in response to this notification  on july   the sct issued an official letter informing fccm that the sct did not accept the resignation of the concession 
on august   the sct issued another official letter to initiate a proceeding to impose sanctions on fccm 
the amount of the sanctions has not been specified 
the proposed sanctions are based  in part  on allegations that fccm has violated the railroad service law in mexico and the terms of its concession 
on august   fccm filed a brief with the sct that challenged the proposed sanctions and introduced evidence supporting fccm s right to resign its concession 
on september   fccm also filed a proceeding in the tax and administrative federal court in mexico seeking an 
table of contents annulment of the sct s july  official letter and recognition of fccm s right to resign its concession 
as a result of sct s answer in this proceeding  on june   fccm filed a brief with new arguments 
the sct has also seized substantially all of fccm s operating assets in response to fccm s resignation of the concession 
on september   fccm filed a proceeding in the second district court in merida district court challenging the sct s seizure of its operating assets as unconstitutional 
the district court admitted the proceeding on october   and a hearing on the constitutional grounds for the seizure and the legality of the sct s actions took place on february  on april   the district court issued a decision upholding the seizure without analyzing the merits of the case 
on may   fccm appealed the decision issued by the district court  before the circuit court in merida 
the circuit court has not yet issued a decision 
in addition to the allegations made by the sct  fccm is subject to claims and lawsuits from aggrieved customers as a result of its cessation of rail operations and the initiation of formal liquidation proceedings 
we believe the sct and customer actions are without merit and unlawful and we will continue to pursue appropriate legal remedies to support fccm s resignation of the concession and to recover fccm s operating assets 
as of december   there was a net asset of million remaining on our balance sheet associated with our mexican operations 
m b arbitration 
as previously disclosed  meridian bigbee railroad llc m b  our subsidiary  csx and kansas city southern kcs were parties to a haulage agreement governing the movement of traffic between meridian  mississippi and burkeville  alabama

arbitration is scheduled for june we plan to vigorously defend ourself against the csx and kcs claims  which we believe to be without merit  and will pursue insurance recovery as appropriate 
although we believe we are entitled to payment for our claims  and that we have meritorious defenses against the counter claims  arbitration is inherently uncertain  and it is possible that an unfavorable ruling could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity as of and for the period in which the determination occurs

in addition to the lawsuits set forth above  from time to time we are a defendant in certain lawsuits resulting from our operations 
management believes there are adequate provisions in the financial statements for any expected liabilities that may result from disposition of the pending lawsuits 
nevertheless  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there would exist the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity as of and for the period in which the ruling occurs

the results of operations for the years ended december   and  were determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states united states gaap 
historical information has been reclassified to conform to the presentation of discontinued operations 
outlook for economic activity in the united states and throughout the world has and could continue to undergo a sharp downturn  which renders expectations inherently uncertain 
however  there are certain noteworthy trends that we expect to affect our results of operations 
we expect same railroad revenues to decline in due to three factors 
first  the canadian and australian dollars depreciated significantly in the second half of the translation impact of the change in exchange rates will consequently reduce our reported revenues in second  we expect lower third party fuel sales  primarily due to lower diesel fuel prices 
third  we expect same railroad freight and non freight revenues to decline due to decreased demand  primarily due to the deterioration in the economy 
in  we expect same railroad carload volumes to be lower than in the significant deterioration in the united states and global economies that began in the second half of is expected to continue throughout as a result  we expect lower carloads in those commodities that are most sensitive to the economic cycle  namely  steel  pulp and paper and lumber and forest products 
however  we expect that carloads from acquisitions completed in will offset the declines in same railroad carloads and that total carloads will therefore increase 
we expect average revenues per carload to decrease due to i the depreciation of the canadian and australian dollar versus the united states dollar  ii decreases in fuel indexed freight rates and decreases in fuel surcharges  in each case as a result of lower diesel fuel prices and iii the effect of carload changes associated with acquisitions  which carloads collectively have lower average revenues per carload than those of same railroad operations 
we expect the freight pricing environment to moderate in the united states and canada in as a result of reduced demand from shippers and a lower fuel price environment 
we expect diesel fuel prices in to be significantly lower than in consequently  we expect lower fuel surcharges and lower freight rates from those freight contracts that are indexed directly or indirectly to the price of diesel fuel 
we expect same railroad non freight revenues to decline primarily due to exiting an industrial switching contract in the united states  lower grain traffic at our united states port terminal railroads and lower equipment and property lease income in australia 
same railroad operating expenses are expected to decrease in primarily due to two factors 
first  in combination with lower fuel consumption  we expect that diesel fuel prices will be significantly lower in  resulting in lower diesel fuel expense in second  transportation expenses are expected to decline in primarily due to lower same railroad carloads 
however  we expect that higher depreciation expense due to higher levels of capital spending in will partially offset these expense reductions 
in response to the rapidly changing economic environment we have taken a number of steps to reduce our operating costs including the furloughing of workers on railroads where volumes have decreased  the storage of cars in excess of current needs and the reduction of the number of locomotives in service

the following significant adjustments were made subsequent to december  to the maryland midland purchase price allocation a decrease in property and equipment of million  an increase in goodwill of million and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of million 
allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not been finalized for ocr or georgia southwestern 
the purchase price allocation for these acquisitions will be finalized in upon the completion of working capital adjustments and fair value analyses 
the deferred tax liabilities in the purchase price allocations are primarily driven by temporary differences between values assigned to non current assets and the acquired tax basis in those assets 
results from continuing operations when comparing our results from continuing operations from one reporting period to another  consider that we have historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses due to one time freight moves  hurricanes  droughts  heavy snowfall  freezing and flooding  customer plant expansions and shut downs  sales of land and equipment and derailments

certain of our railroads have commodity shipments that are sensitive to general economic conditions  including steel products  paper products and lumber and forest products 
however  shipments of other commodities are less affected by economic conditions and are more closely affected by other factors  such as inventory levels maintained at a customer power plant coal  winter weather salt and seasonal rainfall south australian grain

on june   fccm formally notified the sct of its intent to exercise its right to resign its year concession from the mexican government and to cease its rail operations 
the decision to cease fccm s operations was made on june   and was due to the failure of the mexican government to fulfill their obligation to fund the chiapas reconstruction

penalties for non renewal are not considered material 
during  we exercised our option to purchase certain leased rolling stock for million 
since these assets were the subject of a previous sale leaseback transaction  the remaining balance of pre tax unamortized deferred gains of approximately million was included as an offset to the recorded value of the rolling stock acquired 
we are party to several lease agreements with class i carriers to operate over various rail lines in north america 
certain of these lease agreements have annual lease payments 
under certain other of these leases  no payments to the lessors are required as long as certain operating conditions are met 
through december   no payments were required under these lease arrangements 
government grants our railroads have received a number of project grants from state and federal agencies for upgrades and construction of rail lines 
we use the grant funds as a supplement to our normal capital programs 
in return for the grants  the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and improvements on the rail lines that have been upgraded or constructed 
we believe that the levels of service and improvements required under the grants are reasonable 
however  we can offer no assurance that government grants will continue to be available or that even if available  our railroads will be able to obtain them 
budgeted capital expenditures we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which consist of track and equipment improvements of million and new business development projects of million 
in addition  we expect to receive approximately million from government grants to fund additional capital expenditures in we have historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations  while relying on borrowed funds and stock issuances to finance acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with amounts available under our credit facilities will enable us to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the credit facilities 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments that could affect our financial condition

table of contents impact of foreign currencies on operating revenues when comparing the effects on revenues for average foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the year ended december   versus the year ended december   foreign currency translation had a positive impact on our consolidated revenues due to the strengthening of the australian and canadian dollars relative to the united states dollar in the year ended december  the estimated impact for foreign currency was calculated by comparing reported revenues with estimated revenues assuming average rates in effect in the comparable period of the prior year 
however  since the world s major crude oil and refined products are traded in united states dollars  we believe there was little  if any  impact of foreign currency translation on our fuel sales to third parties in australia 
the following table sets forth the impact of foreign currency translation on reported operating revenues dollars in thousands operating revenues year ended december  as reported currency translation impact revenues excluding currency impact united states operating revenues australia operating revenues canada operating revenues netherlands operating revenues total operating revenues critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management uses its judgment in making significant estimates in the areas of recoverability and useful life of assets  as well as liabilities for casualty claims and income taxes 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at historical cost and acquired railroad property at the allocated cost 
we capitalize major renewals or improvements  but routine maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
we credit or charge operating expense for gains or losses on sales or other dispositions 
we depreciate our property and equipment on the straight line method over the useful lives of the road property years and equipment years 

table of contents the following table sets forth the estimated useful lives of our major classes of property and equipment property estimated useful life buildings leasehold improvements years or life of lease bridges tunnels culverts years track property years equipment computer equipment years locomotives freight cars years vehicles mobile equipment years signals crossing equipment years track equipment years other equipment years we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that our long lived tangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of such asset in measuring whether or not impairment has occurred 
if we identify impairment of an asset  we would report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the fair value of such asset  as determined by valuation techniques applicable in the circumstances 
government grants grants from governmental agencies are recorded as long term liabilities and are amortized as a reduction to depreciation expense over the same period during which the underlying purchased assets are depreciated 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the total cost of an acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and asset lives  and therefore require considerable judgment 
these determinations will affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we review the carrying values of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill at least annually to assess impairment  since these assets are not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever such events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
specifically  we test for impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment 
impairments are expensed when incurred 
we perform our annual impairment test as of november th of each year  and no impairment was recognized for the years ended december   and for intangible assets  the impairment test compares the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for goodwill  a two step impairment model is used 
we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimate of fair value of the respective reporting unit is based on the best information available as of the date of assessment  which primarily incorporates certain factors 
table of contents including our assumptions about operating results  business plans  income projections  anticipated future cash flows and market data 
second  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill would be considered impaired and we would then record the goodwill impairment as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value 
amortizable intangible assets sfas requires us to perform an impairment test on amortizable intangible assets when specific impairment indicators  as set forth in sfas  are present 
we have amortizable intangible assets primarily recorded as customer relationships or contracts  service agreements  track access agreements and proprietary software 
the intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the expected economic longevity of the customer relationship  the facility served or the length of the contract or agreement including expected renewals 
derailment and property damages  personal injuries and third party claims we maintain insurance  with varying deductibles up to million per incident for liability and generally up to million per incident for property damage  for claims resulting from train derailments and other accidents related to our railroad and industrial switching operations 
accruals for fela claims by our railroad employees and third party personal injury or other claims are recorded in the period when such claims are determined to be probable and estimable 
these estimates are updated in future periods as facts and circumstances change 
stock based compensation the compensation committee of our board of directors compensation committee has discretion to determine grantees  grant dates  amounts of grants  vesting and expiration dates for grants to our employees through our amended and restated omnibus incentive plan the plan 
the plan permits the issuance of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units and any other form of award established by the compensation committee  in each case consistent with the plan s purpose 
restricted stock units constitute a commitment to deliver stock at some future date as defined by the terms of the awards 
under the terms of the awards  equity grants for employees generally vest over three years and equity grants for directors vest over their respective terms as directors 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model and straight line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant 
two assumptions in the black scholes pricing model that require management judgment are the expected life and expected volatility of the stock 
the expected life is based on historical experience and is estimated for each grant 
the expected volatility of the stock is based on actual historical volatility and adjusted to reflect future expectations 
the fair value of our restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing price on the date of grant 
during the fourth quarter of  we voluntarily conducted and completed a comprehensive internal review of our historical stock option practices for stock option grants made during the period from our initial public offering on june  through the third quarter of  under the direction of the independent members of the board of directors 
the review found no evidence of any intentional wrongdoing by our executive officers  members of our board of directors or any other employees 
however  the internal review identified certain administrative procedural deficiencies that resulted in unintentional accounting errors 
these errors principally related to situations where  as of the grant date approved by the compensation committee  an aggregate number of stock options to be granted was approved and the exercise price for the stock options was established  but the allocation of those stock options to certain individual employee recipients was not finalized until a later date 
as a result  we determined that later measurement dates for accounting purposes for those individuals grants should 
table of contents have been used  and we determined that non cash stock based compensation expense was understated by a cumulative amount of million million after tax  with million related to grants to the general population of employees  none of whom was an executive officer at the time of grant 
under the direction of the audit committee  the results of the internal review were evaluated by outside counsel  who concurred with the findings 
for the year ended december   compensation cost from equity awards was million 
the compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized is million  which will be recognized over the next three years with a weighted average period of one year

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
after considering our preexisting reserves for uncertain tax positions  the adoption of fin did not result in any material adjustments to our results of operations or financial position 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires a balance sheet approach for the financial accounting and reporting of deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between book and tax basis assets and liabilities  as well as available income tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
in our consolidated balance sheets  these deferred obligations are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred income tax obligation or benefit that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred income tax assets related to carryforwards  is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference as of the end of the year 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether  based on all available evidence  our deferred income tax assets are realizable 
valuation allowances are established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
no provision is made for the united states income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of controlled foreign subsidiaries because it is the intention of management to fully utilize those earnings in the operations of foreign subsidiaries 
if the earnings were to be distributed in the future  those distributions may be subject to united states income taxes appropriately reduced by available foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
the amount of undistributed earnings of our controlled foreign subsidiaries as of december  was million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks and use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of certain of these risks 
we use derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with underlying exposures 
we do not trade or use such instruments with 
table of contents the objective of earning financial gains on the interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations alone  nor do we use such instruments where there are no underlying cash exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
we manage our hedging positions and monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and do not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
management believes that our use of derivative financial instruments to manage risk is in our best interest 
however  our use of derivative financial instruments may result in short term gains or losses and increased earnings volatility 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk results from issuing variable rate debt obligations  since an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the table below provides amounts outstanding  fair value and corresponding interest rates for our fixed and variable rate debt dollars in thousands 
december  carrying value fair value fixed rate debt weighted average fixed interest rate variable rate debt swapped to fixed rate debt weighted average fixed interest rate unswapped variable rate debt weighted average variable interest rate total long term debt weighted average interest rate table assumptions variable interest rates the table presents variable interest rates based on united states and canadian libor rates as of december  
the borrowing margin is composed of a weighted average of for debt under our united states and canadian credit facilities and for our series c senior notes 
fair value of financial instruments sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
sfas specifies a three level hierarchy of valuation inputs established to increase consistency  clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices that are observable in the market for the asset or liability 
level inputs are valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable 
sfas requires companies to maximize the use of observable inputs level and level  when available  and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs level when determining fair value 
fair value of debt since our long term debt is not quoted  fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on level valuation inputs  including borrowing rates we believe are currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities 
interest rate sensitivity based on the table above  assuming a one percentage point increase in market interest rates  annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase by approximately million 

table of contents interest rate swap we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates of our variable rate debt 
these agreements are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the agreements are recorded in net income or other comprehensive loss income  based on whether the agreements are designated as part of a hedge transaction and whether the agreements are effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments attributable to our variable rate debt 
on october   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rates on a portion of our outstanding borrowings 
the first swap has a notional amount of million and requires us to pay on the notional amount and allows us to receive month libor 
this swap expires on september  the second swap has a notional amount of million and requires us to pay on the notional amount and allows us to receive month libor 
this swap expires on december  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements were estimated based on level valuation inputs 
the fair values of the swaps represented liabilities of million and million  respectively  at december  the month libor was set at at december  foreign currency risk debt related to our canadian operations is denominated in canadian dollars 
therefore  foreign currency risk related to debt service payments generally does not exist at our canadian operations 
however  in the event that this debt service is funded from our united states operations  we may face exchange rate risk if the canadian dollar were to appreciate relative to the united states dollar  thereby requiring higher united states dollar equivalent cash to settle the outstanding debt  which is due in foreign currency hedge on february   we entered into two foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of million to hedge a portion of our investment in of the equity of arg 
the contracts  which expired on june   protected a portion of our investment from exposure to large fluctuations in the united states australian dollar exchange rate 
at expiration  excluding the effects of fluctuations in the exchange rate on our investment  we recorded a loss of million from these contracts  which is included in the net gain on the sale of arg 
sensitivity to diesel fuel prices we are exposed to fluctuations in diesel fuel prices  since an increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in lower earnings and cash outflows 
in the year ended december   fuel costs for fuel used in operations represented of our total expenses 
as of december   we had not entered into any hedging transactions to manage this diesel fuel risk 
as of december   each one percentage point increase in the price of diesel fuel would result in a million increase in our annual fuel expense to the extent not offset by higher fuel surcharges
