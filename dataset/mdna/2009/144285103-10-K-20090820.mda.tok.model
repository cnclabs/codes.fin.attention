item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of factors that affect the comparability of the selected financial data 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background and general our discussions below in this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report on form k 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all discussions of operating results reflect continuing operations 
carpenter is engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel  cobalt  titanium  manganese  chromium  molybdenum  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire and narrow strip in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders 
our sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico and europe  allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
as a result  we often serve as a technical partner in customizing specialty metals or in developing new ones 
business trends and strategic priorities selected financial results for the past three fiscal years are summarized below fiscal year in millions  except per share data net sales net sales excluding surcharges income from continuing operations net income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted earnings per share purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow pounds sold in thousands includes specialty and titanium alloys  stainless steel and powder materials 
table of contents market conditions were challenging throughout the latter half of fiscal year  as the recent economic downturn was broader and more severe than the last downturn that we experienced in the resulting weak global manufacturing activity affected demand throughout our customer base  including our higher value products  which significantly impacted our results of operations 
despite these prevailing difficult economic conditions  we achieved our financial goal of generating positive free cash flow for fiscal year we believe this achievement demonstrates our ability to manage effectively through the recent downturn 
in response to the challenges of the economic downturn  we have taken steps to stabilize our operations  including the following reduced production hours by to percent and eliminated over positions  reduced selling  general and administrative spending  reduced inventory levels  and tightened control over credit and receivables 
at the same time  we continue to take action to create a strong base from which we can quickly respond to increased demand when markets begin to recover 
in this respect we have protected the core capabilities of our workforce  completed the capacity expansion for our premium melt program  invested in new products and research and development  advanced new marketing programs that will grow our customer base  and focused resources on international growth opportunities 
our commitment to drive growth and operational excellence will yield results as volumes return to more normal levels 
our sales are across a diversified list of end use markets 
the table below summarizes our estimated sales by market over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year in millions aerospace industrial energy medical consumer automotive total net sales the table below shows our net sales by major product class for the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales 
table of contents impact of raw material prices and product mix the volatility of the costs of raw materials has impacted our operations over the past several years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass cost increases on certain materials through to our customers using surcharges that are structured to recover increases in raw material costs 
generally  the formula used to calculate a surcharge is based on published prices of the respective raw materials for the previous month 
a portion of our raw material purchases are based on published prices from two months prior  rather than the previous month  which creates a lag between surcharge revenues and corresponding raw material costs recognized in costs of sales 
except for the usually modest effect of the lag  the surcharge mechanism protects our net income on such sales 
however  surcharges have had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and operating margin percentages as described later in this discussion 
we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in  first out lifo inventory costing methodology 
under the lifo inventory costing method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials may have been acquired at potentially significantly different values due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw materials to the sale of the processed finished goods to the customers 
in a period of rising raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in higher costs of sales 
conversely  in a period of decreasing raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in lower costs of sales 
a portion of our business consists of sales to customers under firm price sales arrangements 
firm price sales arrangements involve a risk of profit margin fluctuations particularly when raw material prices are volatile 
firm price sales arrangements generally include certain annual purchasing commitments and consumption schedules agreed to by the customers at selling prices based on raw material prices at the time the arrangements are established 
in order to reduce the risk of fluctuating profit margins on these sales  we enter into commodity forward contracts to purchase certain critical raw materials necessary to produce the related products sold 
if a customer fails to meet the volume commitments or the consumption schedule deviates from the agreed upon terms of the firm price sales arrangements  the company may need to absorb the gains or losses associated with the commodity forward contracts on a temporary basis 
gains or losses associated with commodity forward contracts are reclassified to earnings loss when earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction 
because we value most of our inventory under the lifo costing methodology  the gains and or losses associated with commodity forward contracts may not impact the same period that the firm price sales contracts revenue is recognized and comparisons of gross profit from period to period may be impacted 
we produce hundreds of grades of materials  with a wide range of pricing and profit levels depending on the grade 
in addition  our product mix within a period is subject to the fluctuating order patterns of our customers as well as decisions we may make to participate in certain lower margin business in order to utilize available capacity 
while we expect to see positive contribution from a more favorable product mix in our margin performance over time  the impact by period may fluctuate  and period to period comparisons may vary 
net pension expense income net pension expense income below includes the net periodic benefit costs credits related to both our pension and postretirement plans 
the following is a summary of the classification of net pension expense income included in our statements of income during fiscal year  and fiscal year in millions cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses pension settlement charges included in restructuring charges total pension expense income 
table of contents net pension expense income is determined annually  based on beginning of the year balances 
net pension expense income increased significantly during fiscal year principally due to the decline in market value of the securities held by the plans as of june  results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  we reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  a year earlier 
continued weak global manufacturing activity affected demand throughout our customer base  and especially in our higher margin markets of energy and aerospace 
net sales net sales for fiscal year were  million  which was a percent decrease from fiscal year excluding surcharge revenues  sales were percent lower than a year earlier 
geographically  sales outside the united states decreased percent from a year ago to million 
international sales remained fairly consistent as a percentage of our total net sales  representing percent and percent for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
sales by end use markets our sales are to customers across diversified end use markets 
during fiscal year  we changed the manner in which sales are classified by end use market so that we could better evaluate our sales results from period to period 
in order to make the discussion of net sales by end use market meaningful  we have reclassified the fiscal year sales by end use market balances to conform to the fiscal year presentation 
the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by principal end use markets fiscal year decrease decrease in millions aerospace industrial energy medical consumer automotive total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by the same principal end use markets  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year decrease decrease in millions aerospace industrial energy medical consumer automotive total net sales excluding surcharge revenues 
table of contents sales to the aerospace market decreased percent from fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent on percent lower shipment volume 
the sales decline reflects the continued impact of a reduction in airplane build schedules and lower overall passenger miles 
excess inventory in jet engines and fasteners also contributed to the lower volumes in fiscal year industrial market sales decreased percent from fiscal year to million 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales decreased approximately percent as a result of a percent decrease in shipment volume 
the results reflect competitive pricing pressures in more commodity oriented applications and reduced overall demand for materials used in valves  fittings  fasteners  and general industrial applications as customers are purchasing limited quantities on an as needed basis 
sales to the energy market of million reflected a percent decrease from the fiscal year excluding surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent from a year ago on lower shipment volume of percent 
the decline in energy sales and shipment volumes principally reflected lower oil and gas exploration activity in the face of weak demand for oil 
declining market demand and high customer inventory have also reduced shipments and sales levels to the power generation sector 
sales to the medical market decreased percent to million from a year ago 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent  while volumes increased percent 
the strong shipment volume reflects higher demand in orthopedic implant and medical instrument applications  while the revenue decline reflects the impact of lower titanium costs and a leaner mix of products 
demand is driven primarily by steady increases in the number of implant procedures in the us  japan and the eu 
sales to the consumer market decreased percent to million from a year ago 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent with shipment volume lower by percent 
the decline reflects lower sales across all sectors  led by housing and electronics as customers and distributors attempt to conserve cash in light of credit availability concerns 
automotive market sales decreased percent from the fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales decreased percent on percent lower shipment volume 
sharply lower consumer spending and tighter credit continued to suppress auto sales  resulting in the further deterioration in production rates 
lower inventory levels in the supply chain reflect customers with demand focused on spot purchases of material with short lead times 
sales by product class the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by major product class fiscal year decrease decrease in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales 
table of contents the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by the same major product class  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year decrease decrease in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales excluding surcharge revenues sales of special alloys products decreased percent in fiscal year as compared with a year ago to million 
the sales decrease principally reflects the decline in demand from the aerospace and energy markets 
sales of stainless steels decreased percent as compared with a year ago 
excluding surcharge revenues  such sales decreased by percent on percent lower shipment volume 
the decrease resulted primarily from reduced shipments of materials used in the automotive  industrial and consumer markets sales of titanium products decreased percent as compared with a year ago on percent lower shipment volume 
the results reflect the impact of significantly lower titanium prices and decreased demand for titanium products used in the aerospace end use market  which was partially offset by an increase in demand in the medical end use market 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal year decreased to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  from million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  a year ago 
the results primarily reflected the reduced demand levels and related manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the lower volume 
our surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs  although generally with a lag effect 
while the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars  it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales 
the following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharges on gross margin for fiscal years and fiscal year in millions net sales less surcharge revenues net sales excluding surcharges gross profit gross margin gross margin excluding dilutive effect of surcharges 
table of contents in addition to the impact of the surcharge mechanism  fluctuations in raw material prices combined with fluctuations in inventory levels have impacted our gross profit from year to year 
we estimate that the effect of such combined fluctuations negatively impacted gross margin by basis points when comparing gross margin for fiscal year with the prior year 
we estimate that the lag effect of the surcharge mechanism positively impacted gross margin by approximately basis points during fiscal year  compared to a positive impact on gross margin of approximately basis points during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million  or percent of net sales of net sales excluding surcharges  compared to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  in fiscal year excluding the impact of changes in net pension expense discussed above  expenses improved by percent over fiscal year the reduction reflects the million charge for a legal matter that was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition to reductions in variable compensation and actions taken to reduce headcount and spending across the business 
restructuring charges during fiscal year  we recorded million of restructuring charges associated with the closure of our metal strip manufacturing facility in the united kingdom uk 
the closure is expected to reduce our fixed costs and to utilize existing production capacity more efficiently 
the charges recorded consisted principally of pension settlement charges from the elimination of a uk defined benefit pension plan  certain asset write downs  payments of employee severance costs and other exit costs 
interest expense fiscal year interest expense of million decreased percent from million in fiscal interest on substantially all of our debt was at a fixed rate 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable to the reductions in outstanding debt related to current year repayments  as well as a million increase in the amount of interest capitalized associated with ongoing construction projects during fiscal year as compared with fiscal year other income  net other income for fiscal year was million as compared with million a year ago 
the decrease principally reflected lower returns on invested cash balances which were partially offset by the favorable impacts of foreign exchange in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year income taxes our effective tax rate income tax expense as a percent of income before taxes for fiscal year was percent as compared to percent in fiscal year the fiscal year tax rate was more favorable than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the following items 
we recorded a reduction in income tax expense in the amount of million or percent of pre tax income related to research and development tax credits 
in addition  there was a reduction in income tax expense in the amount of million or percent which was primarily due to the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of certain statutes of limitations 
these items were partially offset by an increase in tax expense in the amount of million or percent related to additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for state net operating losses 
our lower taxable income level generated a more significant impact on the effective tax rate for these items 

table of contents the fiscal year tax rate was also more favorable than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the following items 
we recorded a reduction in income tax expense of million  or percent of pretax income  reflecting the reversal of valuation allowances that had been recorded against state net operating loss carryforwards in prior years 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 valuation allowances should be reviewed each year and an assessment must be made as to the likelihood of recovery of those deferred taxes 
based on the then current year and forecasted taxable income in certain jurisdictions  we determined that it was appropriate to reverse a portion of this valuation allowance in fiscal year we recognized a benefit of million  or percent of pretax income  in connection with the domestic manufacturing deduction  which was part of the american jobs creation act of allowing a special deduction for qualified manufacturing activities 
the act also provided for a two year phase out of the existing extraterritorial income exclusion deduction 
as a result  we recognized an increase in income tax expense year over year  reflecting the phase out of the deduction in  and the repeal in see note to the consolidated financial statements in
