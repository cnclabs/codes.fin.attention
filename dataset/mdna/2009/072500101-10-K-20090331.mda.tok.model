item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risks that we are currently unaware of or that we do not currently consider material 
if any of the following events actually occur  our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
difficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  us and our industry 
dramatic declines in the housing market  with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions  including us 
because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate related loans  continued decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans in our portfolio 
general downward economic trends  reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions 
this market turmoil has led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and reduction in general business activity 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets may continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operation and stock price 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
because we currently serve limited market areas  we could be more adversely affected by an economic downturn in our market areas than our larger competitors who are more geographically diverse 
currently  our primary market areas are limited to the baltimore metropolitan area  the baltimore washington corridor and maryland s eastern shore 
although the economic decline has not impacted the suburban maryland and washington dc suburbs as adversely as other areas of the united states  it has caused an increase in unemployment and business failures and a significant decline in property values in the metropolitan areas 
as a result  if any of these areas continues to suffer an economic downturn  our business and financial condition may be more severely affected than our larger bank competitors 
our larger competitors serve a more geographically diverse market area  parts of which may not be affected by the same economic conditions that exist in our primary market areas 
further  unexpected changes in the national and local economy may adversely affect our ability to attract deposits and to make loans 
such risks are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and  in turn  the value of our securities 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
further  if us markets and economic conditions continue to deteriorate  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
for example  further declines in the housing market could result in additional asset write downs  which could reduce our liquidity below required levels and require us to seek additional capital 
there can be no guarantee  however  that such capital would be available when we require it or  if available  on favorable terms  and if we raise capital via the sale of common stock  the holdings of our current stockholders would be diluted 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry 
further  given that bay national bank is unable to issue brokered cds without prior approval from the fdic  the bank s inability to replace maturing brokered deposits with core deposits or cash flows from loan repayments may require us to generate liquidity through other means 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand operations through internal growth and deposit gathering could be materially impaired 
government regulation could restrict bay national corporation s or bay national bank s growth or cause bay national corporation or bay national bank to incur higher costs 
bay national corporation and bay national bank operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies 
banking regulations  designed primarily for the safety of depositors  may limit the growth of bay national bank and the return to investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends  mergers with  or acquisitions by  other institutions  investments  loans and interest rates  interest rates paid on deposits  and the creation of branch offices 
laws and regulations could change at any time  and changes could adversely affect bay national corporation s and bay national bank s business 
in addition  the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect bay national corporation s and bay national bank s ability to operate profitably 
in addition  the financial sector has recently been the focus on recent legislative debate and government intervention  and we anticipate that additional laws and regulations may be enacted in response to the current financial crises that could have an impact on our operations 
any changes in regulation and oversight  including in the form of changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies or changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the service and products we offer  increase our operating expenses  and otherwise adversely impact our financial performance and condition 
in addition  the burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general  and bay national bank specifically  at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors 
bay national corporation and bay national bank depend heavily on one key employee  mr 
hugh w 
mohler  and business would suffer if something were to happen to mr 
mohler 
mr 
mohler is the chairman  president and chief executive officer of bay national bank 
if he were to leave for any reason  bay national corporation s and bay national bank s business would suffer because he has banking experience and relationships with clients and potential clients that would not be easy to replace 
in addition  because bay national bank s business is relationship driven  the loss of an employee who has primary contact with one or more of bay national bank s clients could cause bay national bank to lose those clients business  possibly resulting in a decline in revenues 
if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of collateral for repayment 
in determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses  we review and evaluate  among other things  our loans and our loss and delinquency experience and current economic conditions 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
we are particularly susceptible to this risk because we have experienced significant growth in our residential real estate loan portfolio over the past few years 
in general  loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time  a process referred to as seasoning 
as a result  a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio 
because our residential real estate loan portfolio is not significantly seasoned and there has been a downturn in the residential real estate market  the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not be representative of the level that will prevail when the portfolio becomes more seasoned or if the condition of the residential real estate market does not improve 
if delinquencies and defaults continue to increase  we may be required to further increase our provision for credit losses 
material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge offs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
bay national bank s lending strategy involves risks resulting from the choice of loan portfolio 
bay national bank s loan strategy emphasizes commercial business loans and commercial real estate loans 
at december   such loans accounted for approximately of the loan portfolio 
commercial business and commercial real estate loans may carry a higher degree of credit risk than do residential mortgage loans because of several factors including larger loan balances  dependence on the successful operation of a business or a project for repayment  or loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization over the loan term 
bay national bank s lending limit may limit its growth and the growth of bay national corporation 
bay national bank is limited in the amount it can loan to a single borrower by the amount of its capital 
specifically  under current law  bay national bank may lend up to of its unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower 
bay national bank s lending limit is significantly less than that of many of its competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of bay national bank s lending limit from conducting business with bay national bank 
bay national bank faces substantial competition which could adversely affect its ability to attract depositors and borrowers 
bay national bank operates in a competitive market for financial services and faces intense competition from other institutions both in making loans and in attracting deposits 
many of these institutions have been in business for numerous years  are significantly larger  have established customer bases  have greater financial resources and lending limits than bay national bank  and are able to offer certain services that bay national bank is not able to offer 
if bay national bank cannot attract deposits and make loans at a sufficient level  its operating results will suffer  as will its opportunities for growth 
bay national bank s ability to compete may suffer if it cannot take advantage of technology to provide banking services or if its customers fail to embrace that technology 
bay national bank s business strategy relies less on customers access to a large branch network and more on access to technology and personal relationships 
further  the market for financial services is increasingly affected by advances in technology  including developments in telecommunications  data processing  computers  automation  internet based banking and tele banking 
bay national bank s ability to compete successfully may depend on the extent to which bay national bank can take advantage of technological changes and the extent to which bay national bank s customers embrace technology to complete their banking transactions 
our profitability depends on interest rates and changes in monetary policy may impact us 
our results of operations depend to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  such as interest on deposit accounts  and the interest income received from our interest earning assets  such as loans 
interest rates are influenced by  among other things  expectations about future events  including the level of economic activity  federal monetary and fiscal policy and geo political stability  and as a result  are not predictable or controllable 
in addition  competitive factors heavily influence the interest rates we can earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest rates we pay on our deposits 
community banks  in part  are often at a competitive disadvantage in managing their cost of funds compared to the large regional  super regional or national banks that have access to the national and international capital markets 
these factors influence our ability to maintain a stable interest margin 
the costs of being a public company are proportionately higher for small companies like us due to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission have increased the scope  complexity  and cost of corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure practices 
these regulations are applicable to our company 
we expect to experience increasing compliance costs  including costs related to internal controls  as a result of the sarbanes oxley act 
these obligatory costs are proportionately higher for a company of our size and will affect our profitability more than that of some of our larger competitors

item legal proceedings the company is party to legal actions that are routine and incidental to our business 
in management s opinion  the outcome of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

bay national has not paid any cash dividends during and management anticipates that bay national corporation will retain all earnings  if any  in order to provide more funds to operate and expand bay national corporation s business  therefore  bay national corporation has no plans to pay any cash dividends at least until its profitability exceeds the level necessary to support capital growth in excess of regulatory capital needs 
if bay national corporation decides to pay dividends in the future  its ability to do so will depend on the ability of bay national bank to pay dividends to bay national corporation 
in addition  management would consider a number of other factors before deciding to pay dividends  including bay national corporation s earnings prospects  financial condition and cash needs 
in addition  in february  bay national corporation received notice from the federal reserve bank of richmond that bay national corporation is expected to immediately terminate future dividend payments  including payments on trust preferred securities 
this order will remain in effect until bay national corporation receives written approval from the reserve bank to resume such payments 
the amount of dividends that may be paid by bay national bank to bay national corporation depends on bay national bank s earnings and capital position and is limited by statute  regulations and regulatory policies 
as a national bank  bay national bank may not pay dividends from its permanent capital 
all cash dividends must be paid out of undivided profits then on hand  after deducting expenses  including provisions for credit losses and bad debts 
in addition  a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus equals its stated capital  unless there has been transferred to surplus no less than one tenth of the bank s net profits for the preceding two consecutive half year periods in the case of an annual dividend 
occ approval is required if the total of all cash dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  bay national bank may not pay a dividend if  after paying the dividend  it would be undercapitalized as defined in the applicable regulations 
furthermore  under the terms of the february  consent order  the bank may not pay dividends unless it is in compliance with the capital program required by the consent order and applicable regulatory requirements and receives the occ s written non objection

the company funds a variety of loan types including commercial and residential real estate loans  commercial term loans and lines of credit  consumer loans  and letters of credit with an emphasis on meeting the borrowing needs of small businesses 
the company s target customers are small and mid sized businesses  business owners  professionals  nonprofit institutions and high net worth individuals 
overview the company s growth moderated in and operating results declined due to deterioration of the economic environment and industry wide problems in residential real estate lending 
as such  management continues to emphasize prudent asset liability management and it has significantly tightened its underwriting standards for residential real estate loans 
key measurements for the year ended december  include the following total assets at december  increased by to million as compared to million as of december  net loans outstanding increased by from million as of december  to million as of december  there was approximately million in non accrual loans as of december  in addition  the company foreclosed on twenty eight pieces of investor owned residential real estate during these properties were placed into real estate acquired through foreclosure at an estimated net realizable value of approximately million

a detailed discussion of the factors leading to these changes can be found in the discussion below 
recent developments on february   pursuant to a stipulation and consent to the issuance of a consent order  the bank consented to the issuance of a consent order by the occ  the bank s primary banking regulator 
among other things  the order requires the bank and or its board to take certain actions  including developing and submitting certain written plans to the occ  and imposes certain restrictions on the bank designed to improve its financial strength  including the following within days provide a written analysis of the board s decision whether to sell  merge or liquidate the bank or remain independent  if the board decides the bank should remain independent and the occ does not object to the written analysis  within days of the order implement a three year strategic plan for the bank with respect to certain financial objectives  by april  maintain a total risk based ratio  an tier risk based ratio and a leverage ratio  develop a three year capital program that  among other things  assesses current and expected funding needs and ensures that sufficient funds or access to funds exists to meet those needs  ensure that the bank has competent management in its credit risk and asset liability risk management functions  conduct management reviews and adopt a written education program for officers as necessary  immediately take action to protect the bank s interest in assets criticized by the occ and adopt a written program designed to eliminate the basis of such criticism  and develop written plans to address liquidity improvement  loan portfolio management  asset diversification  the bank s allowance for loan and lease losses  monitoring and review of problem loans and leases  charged off loans and related issues  and monitoring of portfolio trends 
the board has appointed a compliance committee to monitor  coordinate and report to the board on the bank s compliance with the consent order 
in addition  under the consent order the bank may not pay dividends unless it is in compliance with the capital program required by the consent order and applicable regulatory requirements and receives the occ s written non objection 
the foregoing description is only a summary of the material terms of the order and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the order  which is filed as exhibit hereto 
the board and its compliance committee and have submitted a written analysis to the occ in which the bank details its decision to remain independent while continually evaluating other options 
summary of key items contained in the board s written response to the consent order the bank s board of directors and executive management are adopting a strategic plan that maps out the strategy for the bank to restore its higher capitalization  strong earnings  good asset quality and to also eliminate the concerns raised by the occ in the consent order 
the plan will return the bank to its original business model  provide stronger risk controls and provide the management and support items necessary to continue to grow and serve its customer base 
we envision all the key elements of the plan being in place by the end of there can be no assurance that the occ will accept our strategic plan to remain independent and they could strictly enforce the terms of the order 
in such a situation there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise the required amount of capital within the time frame required in the order and further regulatory actions could follow 
in order to make the plan work  the bank will focus on six goals that are the keys to its success 
these are a return to the original mission the bank s original mission was to serve local businesses and professionals through internally generated loans 
the bank has returned to that mission 
improve asset quality asset quality must be raised to acceptable levels and thereafter maintained as part of a high quality loan portfolio 
this loan portfolio will consist of primarily internally generated small business loans that are fully within the bank s expertise and provide adequate yields with manageable risk 
increase capitalization capital must be raised to levels above the minimum capital needed to meet regulatory requirements 
this higher level of capital can be achieved by either shrinking the size of the balance sheet or by raising additional contributions from present and new shareholders or by a combination of these two approaches 
increasing the bank s level of capital will ensure that the bank not only remains viable through the present economic downturn  but will have the ability to grow its assets and regain its former earnings profile 
improve liquidity liquidity must be increased and then maintained at a level that is at least comparable with other local banks in terms of core deposits 
more specifically  the bank in solving its liquidity issues has taken  or will take the following steps as well as others primary sources of liquidity develop multiple lines of credit with other financial institutions 
remain a fhlb member with the ability to take advances 
obtain ability to borrow from the federal reserve discount window 
continue use of national market cds which are not considered brokered cds 
maintain and track collateral available to be pledged 
the availability of this collateral will also periodically be validated by a secondary source 
develop a traditional low risk investment portfolio with laddered maturities 
secondary sources of liquidity seek to restore the ability to use brokered funds on a more limited basis than in the past 
seek to restore the ability to fully utilize cdars  or other sweep programs 
establish relationships with other banks for standby participations 
track a pool of loans that would be available for participation 
return to profitability profitability must be restored as soon as possible and beyond that point earnings must show consistent and steady growth 
in the context of improving profitability and preserving capital  the bank has already made the following internal changes that will immediately improve earnings or minimize losses 
significant staff reductions that reduced the bank s ftes from as of march  to as of march  this will result in cost savings of about million in annual salary and benefits 
across the board salary reductions of for all remaining officers except for the chief executive officer who took a reduction 
this will result in annual savings of about  cancellation of and year end bonuses 
board of directors have declined to be paid their fees for and closing of loan production offices in towson and howard county 
the annual savings from these two closures  excluding personnel costs  could be about  in overhead if the bank is successful at finding tenants to sub lease the two properties which have and of square feet  respectively 
develop management depth the executive management team and management succession plan have the depth  experience and talent to maintain the confidence of the public  clients  directors  shareholders and regulators 
the board will evaluate management on a regular basis 
results of operations overview the company recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  this compares to net income of  reported for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the company reported net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in year over year results is primarily due to a million provision for credit losses recorded during caused by the continued deterioration in the residential real estate market  an increase in non accrual loans  an increase in non interest expenses and a decline in the interest rate environment that has made revenue growth difficult 
bay national bank s mortgage origination operations  located in lutherville and salisbury  maryland  originate conventional first and second lien residential mortgage loans and construction and rehabilitation loans 
bay national bank sells most of its first and second lien residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and typically recognizes a gain on the sale of these loans after the payment of commissions to the loan origination officer 
since its inception in february  the salisbury mortgage division has been a significant contributor to operating results 
the towson mortgage operation was initiated in february and began to contribute to the company s overall profitability during the second half of for the years ended december   and  gains on the sale of mortgage loans totaled   and  respectively 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to a slowdown in the real estate markets in the company s primary market areas 
in  the company introduced a loan program for conventional first lien and second lien residential mortgage loans 
under this program  the company purchased a participation in mortgage loans originated by a mortgage company in the baltimore metropolitan area 
these participations are for loans which a secondary market investor has committed to purchase 
the participations are typically held for a period of three to four weeks before being sold to the secondary market investor 
this holding period represents the amount of time taken by the secondary market investor to review the loan files for completeness and accuracy 
during this holding period  the company earns interest on these loans at a rate indexed to the prime rate 
the primary risk to the company from this program is that the secondary market investor may decline to purchase the loans due to documentary deficiencies or errors 
the company attempts to manage this risk by conducting a thorough review of the documentation prior to purchasing the participation 
if the secondary market investor declines to purchase the loan  the company could attempt to sell the loan to other investors or hold the loan in its loan portfolio 
as of december   the company had no such loans outstanding under this program  which are classified as held for sale 
the company earned  of interest on this program during   during and  during the bank terminated the program in due to deterioration in the national mortgage markets 
earnings and asset growth were a challenge in as a result of the slowing economy 
future results will be subject to the volatility of the provision for credit losses  which is related to asset quality and loan growth and the fluctuation of mortgage loan production  all of which are sensitive to economic and interest rate instability  and other competitive pressures that arise in a slowing economy 
net interest income margins net interest income is the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
earning assets are composed primarily of loans  investments  and federal funds sold 
interest bearing deposits and other borrowings make up the cost of funds 
non interest bearing deposits and capital are also funding sources 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources along with changes in associated interest rates determine changes in net interest income 
interest income from loans and investments for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease from and the decrease from were directly related to changes in average yields caused by a declining interest rate environment in and  an increasing interest rate environment in  and the impact of lost interest on increased non accrual loans over the periods 
if the non accrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  we would have recognized additional interest income of approximately   and  for the periods ended december   and  respectively 
the yields on loans and investments declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  and to for the year ended december  the percentage of average interest earning assets represented by loans was  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the average yield on the loan portfolio was  as compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  loan yields declined from and primarily due to eight reductions by the frb in the target federal funds rate during  beginning with a basis point reduction on january  to and ending with a rate of to effective december  as can be seen by the yields discussed above  these fluctuations had a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the timing and amount of the impact on loan yields of changes to the federal funds rates varies from period to period as a result of differences in the mix of fixed rate loans to variable rate loans at any point in time 
the average yield on the investment portfolio and other earning assets such as federal funds sold was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in the average yields were a direct result of the frb actions discussed above 
the percentage of average interest earning assets represented by investments was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense from deposits and borrowings for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease from and the decrease from are directly related to the changes in average rates paid due to federal reserve actions discussed above 
the average rates paid on these liabilities changed from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during  management observed ongoing pressure to pay higher rates on deposits as the market for funds became more competitive 
in addition  the market for loans has been very competitive  which  as is typical  has created downward pressure on loan pricing 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amount of interest income and interest expense  and the resulting yields on average interest earning assets and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities 
average balances are also provided for non interest earning assets and non interest bearing liabilities 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made and no interest income was exempt from federal income taxes 
all average balances are daily average balances 
the average balances of non accrual loans are included in the average loan balances for the periods indicated 
the amortization of loan fees is included in computing interest income  however  such fees are not material

this slowdown resulted in an increase in loan extensions and delinquencies due to the inability of investors to resell properties as quickly as anticipated 
more specifically  the company experienced weaknesses in its portfolio of investor owned residential construction and reconstruction loans  which totaled approximately million of which million was classified as non accrual as of december  in addition  the company foreclosed on twenty eight pieces of investor owned residential real estate during for additional information on nonperforming loans  see the management discussion and analysis section entitled nonperforming loans and other delinquent assets 
management is aggressively addressing the problems in this portfolio  however  resolving these issues will take time as the residential real estate market works through its downturn and housing inventories return to normal levels 
as such  there can be no assurance that management s actions will result in decreases in the levels of non accrual and past due loans 
for additional information regarding the methodology used to determine the provision for credit losses see the management discussion and analysis section entitled allowance for credit losses and credit risk management 
non interest income the components of non interest income were as follows years ended december  service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of mortgage loans increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance loss on sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure other income total non interest income non interest income consists primarily of gains on the sale of mortgage loans  deposit account service charges and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
for the year ended december   the company realized non interest income in the amount of  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
service charges on deposit accounts totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of and over and  respectively 
the increases over the prior years were attributable to an increase in overdraft fees charged on transaction accounts as well as an increase in analysis fees charged on business checking accounts 
although overdraft fees increased  the company continues to maintain a very low level of average overdrafts 
analysis fees have increased as a result of the previously discussed frb actions  which reduced the rates used to calculate credits available to customers to offset any analysis fees they incurred 
gains on the sale of mortgage loans of  represented of non interest income for the year ended december  this compares to gains on the sale of mortgage loans of  or  of total non interest income for the year ended december  and  or  of total non interest income for the year ended december  the decreases from the years ended december  and were due to a general decline in home purchase and refinance activity in the company s markets 
the company recognized increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli of  for the year ended december  compared to  recognized in the prior year 
the company purchased this investment during the fourth quarter of and the initial investment totaled million 
a loss on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure  totaling  resulting from the sale of seventeen residential real estate properties during the year ended december   offset total non interest income for the year 
other income totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these represent decreases of and over and  respectively 
other income primarily consists of cash management fees and the decreases over the prior periods were attributed to a decline in business activity 
the company will continue to seek ways to expand its sources of non interest income 
in the future  the company may enter into fee arrangements with strategic partners that offer investment advisory services  risk management and employee benefit services 
no assurance can be given that such fee arrangements will be obtained or maintained 
non interest expense the components of non interest expense were as follows years ended december  salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses furniture and equipment expenses legal and professional fees data processing and other outside services advertising and marketing related expenses provision for losses on real estate acquired through foreclosure other expenses total non interest expenses compared to non interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits  legal and professional fees  provisions for losses on real estate acquired through foreclosure and other expenses 
salaries and employee benefit expenses represented and of non interest expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries and benefits increased by  or  over the prior year due to additions to staff during and then paying these additional employees for the full year in during  we increased the number of commercial account portfolio managers  commercial lenders and other operations support and added four commercial bankers  a cash management specialist and a commercial account manager to lead expansion into the baltimore washington corridor 
these additions were made to continue to expand our market presence  as well as to manage the growth of the loan and deposit portfolios and support increased operational volume 
although we ended with fewer employees than we had at the beginning of the year  most of these employees left and or were terminated during the latter part of  and as a result  did not have a significant impact on changes to salaries and benefit expenses for the increased expense related to this staffing growth was offset by a decrease in accrued bonuses based on the company s financial performance and a decrease in commissions based on the industry wide slow down in residential real estate lending 
as of december   we had full time employees compared to full time employees at december  we terminated eight employees during the first quarter of and do not intend to significantly expand or reduce the number of employees in the immediate future 
therefore  we expect salaries and benefit expenses to decrease in occupancy expenses increased by  or  due in part to the acquisition of new space obtained during the fourth quarter of for the company s towson residential lending operation  acquisition of space for the team hired to lead expansion into the baltimore washington corridor  assumption of first floor space that had previously been sublet at the bank s lutherville location as well as scheduled rent increases 
legal and professional fees increased by  or  during the majority of which was related to increased legal fees incurred to help manage and workout loans in the company s residential real estate portfolio 
the company recorded a  provision for losses on real estate acquired through foreclosure during compared to  during the prior year 
the  or  increase from the prior year was primarily driven by the deterioration in the residential real estate market  which negatively impacted property values 
the  or  increase in data processing and other outside services resulted from increased costs during for supporting a computer infrastructure at an additional location  the costs associated with enhanced security and preventive maintenance programs and an increase in outsourced data and item processing costs that are a function of the growth of the bank and the number of customer accounts 
the  or  increase in furniture and equipment expenses during was related to increased costs associated with expanded staffing and facilities 
advertising and marketing related expenses increased  or  and was related to increased advertising for the towson residential lending and baltimore washington corridor loan production offices 
the increase of  or  in all other expenses related to various costs associated with the increased size and complexity of the company 
the banking industry utilizes an efficiency ratio as a key measure of expense management and overall operating efficiency 
this ratio is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income before the loan loss provision and non interest income 
the company s efficiency ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ending december  the increase in the efficiency ratio from the prior year was primarily a result of the million contraction in net interest income as well as the million increase in non interest expenses 
approximately of the occupancy costs in were paid to directors of bay national corporation or entities controlled by directors of bay national corporation 
management believes that the terms of these leases are at least as favorable as could be obtained from independent third parties 
however  management has not conducted a recent market analysis to confirm this

compared to non interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily due to increases in other expenses  data processing and other outside services and occupancy expenses 
salaries and employee benefit expenses represented and of non interest expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries and benefits marginally increased by  or 
the bank experienced staffing growth during in commercial account portfolio managers  commercial lenders and other operations support 
in addition  the company added four commercial bankers  a cash management specialist and a commercial account manager during the second half of the year to lead its expansion into the baltimore washington corridor 
these additions were made to continue to expand its market presence  as well as to manage the growth of the loan and deposit portfolios and support increased operational volume 
the increased expense related to this staffing growth was offset by a decrease in accrued bonuses based on the company s financial performance and a decrease in commissions based on the industry wide slow down in residential real estate lending 
occupancy expenses increased by  or  due in part to the acquisition of new space obtained during the fourth quarter of for the company s towson residential lending operation  assumption of first floor space that had previously been sublet at the bank s baltimore location as well as scheduled rent increases 
legal and professional fees increased by  or  during the increase was related to legal fees incurred in connection with the drafting of a stock incentive plan  increased costs associated with drafting the annual report and proxy materials  and increased legal fees incurred to help manage and workout loans in the company s residential real estate portfolio 
there was also an increase in internal and external audit and other accounting fees related to company growth and implementation of provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of related to the documentation and testing of internal control over financial reporting 
the  or  increase in data processing and other outside services resulted from increased costs paid during for the cost of supporting a computer infrastructure at an additional location  the costs associated with enhanced security and preventive maintenance programs and an increase in outsourced data and item processing costs that are a function of the growth of the bank and the number of customer accounts 
the  or  increase in furniture and equipment expenses during was related to increased costs associated with expanded staffing and facilities 
advertising and marketing related expenses decreased  or  which was related to a decline in charitable contributions offset by increased advertising for the towson residential lending and howard county loan production offices 
the increase of  or  in all other expenses relates to various costs associated with the increased size and complexity of the company and a provision for losses on real estate acquired through foreclosure of  recorded during the fourth quarter of in addition  the company experienced an increase of  in fdic insurance expense due to the fdic s revision of its fee structure and growth in our deposit base 
the company s efficiency ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ending december  the increase in the efficiency ratio from the prior year was a result of management s decision to continue to invest in personnel to support the long term growth of the company 
approximately of the occupancy costs in were paid to directors of bay national corporation or entities controlled by directors of bay national corporation

income taxes for the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to income tax expense of  and million recorded for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to the significant pre tax loss incurred for the year ended december  at december   the company had approximately million of cumulative maryland pre tax net operating loss carryforwards a possible net tax benefit of thousand for the unconsolidated state tax return for bay national corporation 
unless bay national corporation generates income from its own operations ie  unrelated to bay national bank  these operating loss carryforwards will expire in at december   the company had a valuation allowance offsetting of the thousand receivable 
financial condition composition of the balance sheet total assets of the company were million as of december   compared to total assets of million as of december  this represents growth of approximately million  or  since december  deposits at december  were million as compared to deposits of million at december  the increase in deposits was primarily attributed to an increase of million in certificates of deposit and an million increase in non interest bearing deposits  which was offset by a million decrease in other interest bearing deposits 
as of december   loans including loans held for sale net of a million allowance for credit losses  totaled million 
this represents an increase of million  or  from december  loan growth was particularly strong in the company s lutherville office and its former baltimore washington corridor office 
this growth resulted from the addition of experienced commercial relationship managers who were well positioned to take advantage of market disruptions caused by turnover in the lending staffs of two institutions in the company s markets 
a total of approximately million in loans outstanding as of december  were paid off during this activity  combined with normal fluctuations in revolving credit balances and installment payments on amortizing loans  offset the approximately million in new loans  excluding loans held for sale  funded during that same period 
during  the company funded approximately million in mortgage loans held for sale and sold approximately million in the secondary market 
the composition of the loan portfolio as of december  was approximately million of commercial loans excluding real estate loans  million of consumer loans and million of real estate loans excluding million of mortgage loans held for sale 
the composition of the loan portfolio as of december  was approximately million of commercial loans excluding real estate loans  million of consumer loans and million of real estate loans excluding million of mortgage loans held for sale 
the overall growth in the loan portfolio and specifically the increased concentration in commercial loans are a direct result of the expansion into the baltimore washington corridor as well as the marketing efforts of bank employees  members of the board of directors and the baltimore and salisbury advisory boards 
the company experienced weakness in its portfolio of investor owned residential construction and reconstruction loans 
this total portfolio as of december  was approximately million of which million was classified as non accrual 
management is proactively and aggressively addressing the problems in this portfolio by reviewing the specific credits more frequently  consulting with legal counsel when necessary  working with borrowers for potential restructure and or working with potential investors to facilitate the sale of the underlying property 
as a result of these efforts  this portfolio declined by million from a balance of million as of december  in addition  the company has significantly tightened underwriting standards for these types of loans and is currently originating very few of these loans 
resolving these issues will take time as the residential real estate market works through its downturn and housing inventories return to normal levels  and there can be no assurance that management s actions will result in decreases in the level of non accrual and past due loans 
during  the company foreclosed on twenty eight pieces of residential real estate  the majority of which were investor owned properties 
these properties were recorded as real estate acquired through foreclosure at an estimated net realizable value of approximately million 
the million difference between the related loan balances totaling approximately million and the net realizable value of million was charged off to the allowance for credit losses during that period 
as of december   the net realizable value for the remaining fourteen properties was million 
during  the company foreclosed on three pieces of investor owned residential real estate 
these properties were placed into real estate acquired through foreclosure at an estimated net realizable value of approximately million 
the approximate thousand difference between the related loan balances totaling approximately million and the million net realizable value was charged off to the allowance for credit losses during as of december   the net realizable value for these properties was  prior to these foreclosures  the company had no other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
based on review of estimates of current market values for these properties  the company recorded a provision of  and  in december and  respectively 
funds not extended in loans are held in cash and due from banks  and various investments including federal funds sold and other overnight investments  united states treasury securities  federal reserve bank stock and fhlb stock 
these investments totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  other than the investments in federal reserve bank stock and fhlb stock  totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  all investments have maturities of days or less 
the treasury securities are used to collateralize municipal deposits and repurchase agreements which are classified as short term borrowings of which  was outstanding as of december  there were no outstanding repurchase agreements as of december  management reviews its liquidity position daily to ensure that funds are readily available to fund the growth of the loan portfolio or to fund the maturity of higher cost national time deposits 
in march  the board of directors approved a new investment policy and authorized management of the company to invest in a more traditional securities portfolio in order to provide ongoing liquidity  income and a ready source of collateral that can be pledged in order to access other sources of funds 
total stockholder s equity at december  was million as compared to million at december  the decrease in stockholder s equity is primarily a result of the negative operating results for the year ended december  composition of loan portfolio because yields on loans typically exceed the yields on investments  the company s long term business strategy is to continue to increase the overall level of loans  as well as maintain a relatively high percentage of loans to total earning assets 
increasing loans and loans as a percentage of total earning assets will maximize the net interest margin 
as of december  and  loans represented and of total earning assets  respectively 
however  in order to enhance liquidity  the company is willing to accept a slightly lower margin by creating an investment portfolio that could result in a decrease in the percentage of loans to total earning assets 
the following table sets forth the composition of the principal balances of the company s loan portfolio as of december      and  respectively 
commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction real estate home equity line of credit loans held for sale consumer total loans the following table sets forth the percentages of loans in each category for the company s loan portfolio as of december     and  respectively 
commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction real estate home equity line of credit loans held for sale consumer total loans the following table sets forth the maturity distribution for the company s loan portfolio at december  some of the loans may be renewed or repaid prior to maturity 
therefore  the following table should not be used as a forecast of future cash flows 
within one year one to three years three to five years over five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction real estate home equity line of credit loans held for sale consumer total fixed interest rate variable interest rate loans held for sale total the scheduled repayments as shown above are reported in the maturity category in which the payment is due  except for the adjustable variable rate loans  which are reported in the period of repricing 
the company s loan portfolio composition as of december  reflects a concentration in variable rate loans 
loans held for sale represented of the company s loan portfolio 
fixed rate loans totaled million  or  of the company s loan portfolio 
interest rates on variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
loans held for sale are expected to be sold in three months or less and as a result are not materially impacted by interest rate fluctuations 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  the interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and  if rates were to fall  the interest earned would decline 
see liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
the officers and directors of the company  including their related companies  had outstanding loans from the bank of million at december  and million at december  all loans made to officers and directors  including their related companies  are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unaffiliated third parties and do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
allowance for credit losses and credit risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the type of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company charges the provision for credit losses to earnings to maintain the total allowance for credit losses at a level considered by management to represent its best estimate of the losses known and inherent in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate  based on  among other factors  prior loss experience  volume and type of lending conducted  estimated value of any underlying collateral  economic conditions particularly as such conditions relate to the company s market area  regulatory guidance  peer statistics  management s judgment  past due loans in the loan portfolio  loan charge off experience and concentrations of risk if any 
the company charges losses on loans against the allowance when it is believed that collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance 
management uses a loan grading system where all loans are graded based on management s evaluation of the risk associated with each loan 
a factor  based on the loan grading  is applied to the loan balance to reserve for potential losses 
in addition  management judgmentally establishes an additional nonspecific reserve 
the nonspecific portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information about a borrower s financial condition and the difficulty of identifying other risk factors and or triggering events that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
the reserve factors used are based on management s judgment as to appropriate reserve percentages for various categories of loans  and management adjusts those values based on the following historical losses in each category  historical and current delinquency in each category  underwriting standards in each category  comparison of losses and delinquencies to peer group performance and an assessment of the likely impact of economic and other external conditions on the performance of each category 
a test of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is performed and reported to the board of directors on a monthly basis 
management uses the information available to make a determination with respect to the allowance for credit losses  recognizing that the determination is inherently subjective and that future adjustments may be necessary depending upon  among other factors  a change in economic conditions of specific borrowers or generally in the economy and new information that becomes available 
however  there are no assurances that the allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to absorb losses on nonperforming assets or that the allowance will be sufficient to cover losses on nonperforming assets in the future 
the allowance for credit losses as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the amount equates to and of outstanding loans  including loans held for sale  as of december  and  respectively 
bay national corporation has no exposure to foreign countries or foreign borrowers 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate for each period presented 
the following table represents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for credit losses for the periods presented balance at beginning of year provision for credit losses loan charge offs commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction real estate home equity line of credit consumer loan recoveries commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction net charge offs recoveries balance at end of year the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for credit losses  reflecting use of the methodology presented above for the periods presented amount commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction real estate home equity line of credit loans held for sale consumer unallocated total allowance the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses decreased in this occurred because the company calculates an overall reserve level while the underlying portfolio experienced a moderate shift in the mix of loans by risk grade and the real estate market softened in the company s primary market areas 
the shift in the mix of loans by risk grade is a normal result of the addition of new loans  the decrease in balances of more mature loans and the ongoing reassessment of all loans 
the following table sets forth the percentages of loans in each category for the company s loan portfolio as of december      and  respectively 
commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction real estate home equity line of credit loans held for sale consumer total loans nonperforming loans and other delinquent assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more and still accruing  troubled debt restructures and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
management will generally classify loans as non accrual when collection of full principal and interest under the original terms of the loan is not expected or payment of principal or interest has become days past due 
in cases where management has additional information that leads it to believe that we will still collect the full principal and interest due under the loan  management will not classify such loan as non accrual even though payment of principal or interest on such loan has become days past due 
classifying a loan as non accrual results in the company no longer accruing interest on such loan and reversing any interest previously accrued but not collected 
a non accrual loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected 
as of december   the company had million of non accrual loans compared to million as of december  any property acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure on a mortgage loan is classified as real estate acquired through foreclosure and recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
any required write down of the loan to its net realizable value will be charged against the allowance for credit losses 
upon foreclosure  the company generally will require an appraisal of the property and  thereafter  appraisals of the property on at least an annual basis with external inspections on at least a quarterly basis 
as of december  the company held million of real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure  which was net of an allowance of  for estimated losses in market value 
this compares to  held at december   which was net of a provision of  for estimated losses in market value 
troubled debt restructures  which are loans that have been restructured due to the borrower s inability to maintain a current status on the loan  totaled  as of december  and were comprised of three loans from the company s residential real estate construction portfolio 
the company had no troubled debt restructures as of december  the company applies the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that impaired loans  which consist of all modified loans and other loans for which collection of all contractual principal and interest is not probable  be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if repayment of the loan is collateral dependent 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance and corresponding provision for credit losses 
the company considers consumer loans as homogenous loans and thus does not apply the sfas no 
impairment test to these loans 
impaired loans will be written off when collection of the loan is doubtful 
as of december   the company had impaired loans totaling million of which million represented non accrual loans  million represented loans days or more past due and accruing and  represented troubled debt restructures 
non accrual loans as of december  were comprised of commercial loans totaling million  residential investment real estate loans totaling million  residential real estate construction loans totaling million  residential mortgage loans totaling  and home equity lines of credit totaling  troubled debt restructures were comprised of three loans in the company s commercial real estate portfolio 
these nonperforming loans represented of total outstanding loans  including loans held for sale  as of december  all of these loans were at least partially collateralized by real estate 
as of december   the company had impaired loans totaling million  all of which were included in its investor owned residential real estate construction loan portfolio  were classified as non accrual loans and were over days past due 
management will continue to closely monitor these loans and the overall level of delinquencies  however  management believes that the allowance for credit losses was adequate for these loans 
for troubled debt restructures  management establishes a specific reserve for those loans that have an estimated fair value that is below the carrying value 
troubled debt restructures had a carrying amount of  as of december  with specific reserves of  the respective allowance for credit losses allocated to impaired loans was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and no income had been accrued or collected on those impaired loans classified as non accrual loans while they had been classified as impaired 
if the non accrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  the company would have recognized additional interest income of approximately   and  for the periods ended december   and  respectively 
any losses on these loans will be charged off as soon as the amount of loss is determinable 
as of december   the company had approximately million of loans  where known credit problems existed  that were subsequently classified as non accrual loans as the company determined that collection of full principal and interest under the original terms of the loans were not expected 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses was adequate for these loans as of december  investment portfolio the company has chosen to invest its available funds primarily in federal funds sold and other overnight investments 
as a result  investment securities as of december   consisted of  of federal reserve bank stock and  of fhlb stock 
investment securities for the year ended december   consisted of  of federal reserve bank stock   of fhlb stock and  of us treasury securities which mature within three months 
the company had no investments that were obligations of the issuer  or payable from or secured by a source of revenue or taxing authority of the issuer  whose aggregate book value exceeded of stockholders equity at december  the following table reflects the amortized cost  estimated fair value and weighted average yield of the investment portfolio as of december amortized cost estimated fair value weighted average yield us treasury securities due within one year other equity securities total investments amortized cost estimated fair value weighted average yield us treasury securities due within one year other equity securities total investments management has made the decision to maintain its available funds in highly liquid assets because it wants to ensure that funds are readily available to fund loan commitments and maturing time deposits 
management believes that this strategy will allow the company to maximize interest margins while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity 
sources of funds general deposits  short term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements  short term borrowings under an overnight commercial paper program  short term borrowings under secured and unsecured lines of credit  borrowings under the subordinated debt  scheduled amortization and prepayment of loans  funds provided by operations and capital are the current sources of funds utilized by the company for lending and investment activities  and other general business purposes 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit products having a range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposits consist of checking accounts  savings accounts  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the following table sets forth the composition of the company s deposits as of december  and december  demand deposits savings money market and sweep certificates of deposit total deposits the mix of deposits shifted to a higher concentration of demand deposits and certificates of deposit and a decreased concentration in savings and money market and sweep accounts in compared to the increased concentration in demand deposits was primarily a function of the movement of customers funds into these accounts following the termination of the commercial paper program due to the declining interest rate environment and the fdic s temporary liquidity guaranty program  which provides deposit insurance for the full amount of most non interest bearing transaction accounts through december  certificates of deposit accounts increased by approximately million due to management s decision to aggressively compete for national market deposits during for liquidity management 
of the total deposits at december   million  or  was related to one customer as compared to million  or  at december  for this same customer 
the deposits for this large customer tend to fluctuate significantly  as a result  management monitors these deposits on a daily basis to ensure that liquidity levels are adequate to compensate for these fluctuations 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution for the company s deposits at december  some of the deposits may be renewed or withdrawn prior to maturity 
therefore  the following table should not be used as a forecast of future cash flows 
within one year one to three years three to five years over five years total demand deposits savings money market and sweep certificates of deposit total certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more  and their remaining maturities at december   are as follows three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total the market in which the company operates is very competitive and the rates of interest paid on deposits are affected by rates paid by other depository institutions 
management closely monitors rates offered by other institutions and seeks to be competitive within the market 
the company has chosen to selectively compete for large certificates of deposits 
the company will choose to pursue such deposits when expected loan growth provides for adequate spreads to support the cost of those funds 
as of december   the company had outstanding certificates of deposit of approximately million that were either obtained through the listing of certificate of deposit rates on two internet based listing services such deposits are sometimes referred to herein as national market certificates of deposit or to a lesser extent  acquired through promontory financial network s cdars program 
the national market certificates of deposit were issued with an average yield of and an average term of months 
included in the million are national market certificates of deposit totaling million that have been classified as brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes 
these brokered deposits were issued with an average yield of and an average term of months 
as of december   the total certificates of deposit obtained through the listing of certificate of deposit rates on the internet based listing services were approximately million  and included  of brokered deposits 
the company has never paid broker fees for deposits 
in the first quarter of  the company began using brokered certificates of deposit through promontory financial network 
through this deposit matching network and its cdars program  the company had the ability to offer its customers access to fdic insured deposit products in aggregate amounts exceeding current insurance limits 
when the company places funds through cdars on behalf of a customer  it receives matching deposits through the network 
the company also has the ability to raise deposits directly through the network 
these deposits are also considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes 
as of december   the company had approximately million of cdars deposits outstanding all of which was placed on behalf of customers 
these deposits were issued with an average yield of and an average term of months 
effective september   the company was unable to accept additional brokered deposits without prior fdic approval 
this is a standard requirement for banks that are deemed to be adequately capitalized 
as of december   million of the million of brokered cds will mature during the first quarter of below is a reconciliation of total deposits to core deposits as of december  and  respectively december  december  total deposits commercial paper sweep balances national market certificates of deposit variable balance accounts customer in and portion of variable balance accounts considered to be core core deposits core deposits  which management categorizes as commercial paper sweep balances and all deposits other than national market certificates of deposit  cdars deposits and million of the million deposits from the large customer described above  stood at million as of december   down from million as of december  overall  the company did not aggressively compete for new local deposits during  which essentially accounts for the decrease in core deposits from core deposits are closely monitored by management because they consider such deposits not only a relatively stable source of funding but also reflective of the growth of commercial and consumer depository relationships 
borrowings 
short term borrowings as of december  consist primarily of million borrowed under federal funds lines of credit 
these borrowings are unsecured and are subordinated to all deposits 
short term borrowings as of december  included million borrowed under commercial paper  borrowed under federal funds lines of credit and million borrowed under its secured fhlb credit facility 
subordinated debt consists of million of fixed interest rate trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities  issued on december  through a delaware trust subsidiary  bay national capital trust i the trust 
the trust was formed for the purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities and all of its common securities are owned by the company 
the company purchased the common securities from the trust for  in accordance with provisions of fin  the financial position and results of operations are not included in the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the trust used the proceeds of the sale of the trust preferred securities and common securities to purchase from the company the aggregate principal amount of  of the company s fixed rate junior subordinated debt securities due the debt securities 
like the trust preferred securities  the debt securities bear interest at the fixed annual rate of until maturity 
the interest expense on trust preferred securities  which include amortization of issuance costs  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the debt securities mature on february   but may be redeemed at the company s option at any time on any february  may  august or november on or after february   or at any time upon certain events  such as a change in the regulatory capital treatment of debt securities  the trust being deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended  or the occurrence of certain adverse tax events 
except upon the occurrence of the events described above  which require a redemption premium for redemptions prior to february   the company may redeem the debt securities at their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued interest  if any 
the parent is required to retain  of the proceeds from the debt securities for general corporate purposes which may include making interest payments on the debt securities until the earlier of i the date on which the retained funds are reduced to zero  or ii the date on which the bank or any successor meets the statutory requirements to pay dividends of at least  for each of two consecutive quarters with positive retained earnings remaining after any such dividend payment 
as of december   the bank met the retained earnings requirement 
the debt securities are subordinated to the prior payment of other indebtedness of the company that  by its terms  is not similarly subordinated 
although the debt securities are recorded as a liability on the company s balance sheet  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital  subject to regulatory guidelines that limit the amount included to an aggregate of of tier capital 
on january   the company provided notice under the indenture of its election to defer the interest payment due on february  under the terms of the indenture for the debt securities dated december  the indenture  the company has the right to defer payments of interest on the debt securities for up to consecutive quarterly periods  provided that no event of default as defined in the indenture has occurred and is continuing at the time of the deferral 
the company was not in default with respect to the indenture at the time the payments were deferred and such deferral did not cause an event of default under the indenture 
although the company has the financial means to pay the interest on the debt securities  management elected to defer payments of interest at this time to conserve cash 
in addition  the company had informal discussions with the frb that led it to believe that the frb would instruct them to defer the future interest payments 
in february  the company received formal notice from the frb instructing it to suspend its trust preferred interest payments 
during the period in which interest payments are being deferred  the company may not  subject to certain exceptions  i declare or pay any dividends or distributions on  or redeem  purchase  acquire  or make a liquidation payment with respect to  any of its capital stock  ii make any payments on  repay  repurchase or redeem any debt securities other than those that rank senior to the debt securities  or iii make any payment under any guarantees of the company  other than those that rank senior to the company s guarantee on the capital securities issued by the trust 
interest on the debt securities continues to accrue during the deferral period and interest on the deferred interest also accrues  both of which must be paid at the end of the deferral period 
prior to the expiration of the deferral period  the company has the right to further defer interest payments  provided that no deferral period  together with all prior deferrals  exceed consecutive quarters 
as of december   the company had unused commitments for a total of million of borrowing availability under an unsecured federal funds line of credit with another institution 
this facility was terminated on january  primarily based on the company s negative earnings trend 
the company also had approximately million of borrowing capacity with the fhlb of atlanta as of december  this facility was suspended on february  the company has taken steps to restore this line of credit and as of march   the company has available borrowing capacity of approximately million

interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of asset liability management is to minimize interest rate risk as net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to minimize the risk associated with these rate swings  management attempts to structure the company s balance sheet so that the ability exists to adjust pricing on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute interest rate sensitivity 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques used in asset liability management 
the interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments  and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the following table sets forth the amount of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   which are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods shown maturity or repricing within amount percent of total to months to months to years over years interest earning assets federal funds sold and other overnight investments loans held for sale loans variable rate loans fixed rate other earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits variable rate deposits fixed rate short term borrowings variable rate subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities periodic repricing differences periodic gap cumulative gap ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities the company has of its interest earning assets and of its interest bearing liabilities in variable rate balances 
the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities of million in the categories of items maturing or repricing within years comprises the majority of the overall gap 
this gap is generally reflective of the company s emphasis on investing in short term investments and originating variable rate loans and the demand in the market for higher yielding fixed rate deposits 
this analysis indicates that the company generally will benefit from rising market rates of interest but will generally be adversely affected by declining market rates of interest 
however  since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same pace  the gap is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity 
the analysis of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration the fact that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
net interest income may be affected by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management constantly monitors and manages the structure of the company s balance sheet  seeks to control interest rate exposure and evaluate pricing strategies while maximizing earnings and net worth 
strategies and policies to manage the balance sheet are predicated upon the examination of how interest rate risk affects overall business risk  capital risk  liquidity risk  and credit risk 
the proper strategy will depend on the current level of risk  the time frame  and the current and expected interest rate environment 
the company will attempt to extend fixed rate liabilities to longer maturities while purchasing variable rate assets to widen the net interest margin if it determines that interest rates will more than likely increase 
if the company perceives that interest rates will decline  an attempt will be made to shorten fixed rate liabilities while securing longer term fixed rate assets 
in theory  maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity can diminish interest rate risk 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors  including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change and the availability of funding sources 
management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize the overall interest rate risk to the company 
liquidity the company s overall asset liability management strategy takes into account the need to maintain adequate liquidity to fund asset growth  deposit runoff and ongoing operations 
management monitors the liquidity position daily 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  commercial paper  borrowings under the federal funds and fhlb credit facilities  scheduled amortization and prepayment of loans  funds provided by operations and capital 
the company also has access to national markets for certificates of deposit 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competition 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and assets that can be readily converted into cash  including investment securities maturing within one year 
as of december   the company had million in cash and due from banks and million in federal funds sold 
as of december   the company had million in cash and due from banks  million in federal funds sold and other overnight investments and  in three month us treasury securities held in mutual funds 
the increase in the overall level of liquid assets  other than loans expected to be sold within days  is the result of management s decision to maintain margins by using available liquidity to fund loan growth and allow non core time deposits to mature 
as of december   the company had unused commitments for a total of million of borrowing availability under unsecured federal funds lines of credit with one financial institution 
this facility was terminated on january  primarily based on the company s negative earnings trend 
the company also had approximately million of borrowing capacity with the fhlb of atlanta  which was subsequently suspended on february  the company has taken steps to restore this line of credit and as of march   the company has available borrowing capacity of approximately million 
these credit facilities can be used in conjunction with the normal deposit strategies  which include pricing changes to increase deposits as necessary 
from time to time  the company may sell or participate out loans to create additional liquidity as required 
effective with the filing of the september  call report  the company was unable to accept additional brokered deposits without prior approval of the fdic 
this is a standard requirement for banks that are deemed to be adequately capitalized 
as of december   million of the million of brokered cds will mature during the first quarter of as an additional source of liquidity  management has also identified specific loans to sell and has contacted several correspondent banks as potential purchasers of such loans 
some of those correspondents have expressed an interest and have begun preliminary reviews of documentation provided by the company 
since undertaking transactions of this nature could have an adverse impact on the profitability of the company ie  loss in interest income on the participated loans this is being considered only as a contingent source of liquidity 
in early  the bank received notice of changes to its borrowing capacity with a correspondent bank and the fhlb of atlanta and of changes to its clearing account maintained at the federal reserve bank 
these changes were primarily a result of the bank s negative earnings trends and its categorization as adequately capitalized 
on january   the bank was notified that its million unsecured line with fulton bank was terminated 
this line had been used for short term liquidity needs 
on february   the federal reserve bank of richmond notified the company that its federal reserve account would be placed on real time monitoring and the company was responsible for providing million in collateral 
with this change  the company is not allowed to initiate a funds transfer that exceeds its available balance and the pledged collateral would be used to cover inadvertent daylight overdrafts 
the required collateral has been pledged and as of march   a daylight overdraft has not occurred in the account as management closely monitors the position on a daily basis 
also on february   the company was notified by the fhlb of atlanta that it must physically deliver specific loan documents for all pledged collateral and that future borrowing capacity would be determined after fhlb s review of those files 
on march   management received the results of fhlb s review of the loan files and is currently organizing appropriate responses and or gathering additional documentation 
the company currently has borrowing capacity of approximately million with fhlb and expects to increase the available line pending submission of additional loan documentation 
in response to the termination of the line of credit by fulton bank and the temporary revocation of borrowing capacity by fhlb  the company immediately sought to increase liquidity through issuance of national market certificates of deposit 
the company has been successful with generating cash from this market while it works diligently to restore the lines of credit with fhlb and where possible  obtain lines of credit from other institutions 
because management recognizes the importance of liquidity given the negative earnings trends and the deterioration in the economy  the company submitted an application to the federal reserve s discount window lending program 
this program is a mechanism for implementing monetary policy and is also used as a backup source of funds for individual depository institutions 
the primary credit program under the discount window aids the implementation of monetary policy by making funds readily available at the primary credit rate when there is a temporary shortage of liquidity in the banking system  making the process of borrowing from the discount window administratively easier and promoting consistency in the lending function across the federal reserve system 
this program reduces depository institutions reluctance to borrow  thus making the discount window a more effective policy instrument 
the secondary credit program makes credit available  when appropriate  to meet backup liquidity needs of depository institutions that do not qualify for primary credit 
to further aid in managing the company s liquidity  in a march meeting  the board approved the formation of an investment committee and the use of available cash to establish an investment portfolio 
the investment committee will meet to review and discuss recommendations for the composition of the portfolio 
by limiting the maturity of securities and maintaining a conservative investment posture  management can rely on the investment portfolio to help meet any short term funding needs 
among the options available to the company is selling shares of common stock to raise capital and improve our liquidity position 
based on the actions noted above  we believe that the company has backup facilities in place to meet a liquidity shortfall 
although the company believes sufficient liquidity exists  if economic conditions continue to deteriorate and consumer confidence is not restored  this excess liquidity could be depleted  which would then materially affect the company s ability to meet its operating needs and to raise additional capital 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit  lines of credit and standby letters of credit 
the company uses these financial instruments to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
in addition  the company also has operating lease obligations and purchase commitments 
outstanding loan commitments and lines and letters of credit at december  and are as follows loan commitments unused lines of credit letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  which may require payment of a fee 
unused lines of credit represent the unused portion of lines of credit previously extended and available to the customer as long as there is no violation of any contractual condition 
these lines generally have variable interest rates 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  and since it is unlikely that customers will draw upon their line of credit in full at any time  the total commitment amount or line of credit amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company is not aware of any loss it would incur by funding its commitments or lines of credit 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contract amount of the commitment 
in general  loan commitments  lines of credit and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including with respect to collateral  as outstanding loans 
each customer s credit worthiness and the collateral required are evaluated on a case by case basis 
the decline in the overall level of loan commitments and unused lines of credit as of december  as compared to december   is reflective of management s decision to strictly manage loan growth and is also reflective of the current global economic downturn 
the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date within one year one to three years three to five years over five years total deposits without a stated maturity a certificates of deposit a other borrowings a operating leases purchase obligations total a includes accrued interest payable 
the company s operating lease obligations represent short and long term lease and rental payments for facilities 
purchase obligations represent estimated obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company 
the purchase obligation amounts presented above primarily relate to estimated obligations under data and item processing contracts and accounts payable for goods and services received through december  capital resources the company had stockholders equity at december  of million as compared to million at december  the decrease in capital is the result of negative operating results 
the company has declared no cash dividends since its inception 
management is extremely focused on improving the company s capital as required by the terms of the occ s consent order 
banking regulatory authorities have implemented strict capital guidelines that directly relate to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher defined credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risks 
the bank has met its capital adequacy requirements to date and is presently evaluating alternative courses of action to improve its capital position and to meet the higher risk based capital ratios imposed by the occ in its consent order 
banking regulations also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the bank s regulatory agencies 
regulatory approval is required to pay dividends that exceed the bank s net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
the bank could not have paid dividends to the company without approval from bank regulatory agencies at december  and no such payments are currently planned 
furthermore  under the terms of the consent order  the bank may not pay dividends unless it is in compliance with the capital program required by the order and applicable regulatory requirements and receives the occ s written non objection 
in addition  in february  bay national corporation received notice from the federal reserve bank of richmond that it is expected to immediately terminate future dividend payments  including payments on trust preferred securities 
this order will remain in effect until bay national corporation receives written approval from the reserve bank to resume such payments

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting policy that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and  as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s best estimate of losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate  based on  among other factors prior loss experience of the company and peer institutions  current economic conditions  review of the ongoing financial conditions of borrowers  and the views of the company s regulators and the firm that conducts an annual independent loan review 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company uses a loan grading system where loans are graded based on management s evaluation of the risk associated with each loan 
a factor  based on the loan grading  is applied to the loan balance to reserve for losses 
in addition  management judgmentally establishes an additional nonspecific reserve 
the nonspecific portion of the allowance reflects management s estimate of probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
management has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the provision and allowance for credit losses  including the valuation of collateral and the assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  and in establishing allowance percentages and risk ratings 
the establishment of allowance factors is a continuing exercise and allowance factors may change over time  resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount of the provision or allowance based upon the same volume and classification of loans 
changes in allowance factors or in management s interpretation of those factors will have a direct impact on the amount of the provision and a corresponding effect on income and assets 
also  errors in management s perception and assessment of the allowance factors could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio and may result in additional provisions or charge offs  which would adversely affect income and capital 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan and lease losses  see the provision for credit losses and credit risk management section of this financial review 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during and the expected impact of accounting policies  recently issued or proposed  but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impact of these changes are discussed in the applicable section s of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
risk management the board of directors is the foundation for effective corporate governance and risk management 
the board demands accountability of management  keeps stockholders and other constituencies interests in focus and fosters a strong internal control environment 
through its executive  asset liability and audit committees  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including market  credit  liquidity and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior management actively manages risk at the line of business level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability committee  the internal audit process and quality control functions and other risk management groups within the company 
this risk management structure is designed to uncover risk issues through a systematic process  enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk 
the risk management process establishes risk limits  and other measurement systems  with a focus on risk reduction strategies and capital allocation practices
