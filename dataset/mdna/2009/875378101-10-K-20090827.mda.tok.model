item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item should be read in the context of the information included elsewhere in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item of this annual report 
overview we are organized along men s and women s product lines and have two reportable segments men s accessories  consisting of belts  gifts  wallets and other small leather goods  suspenders  and sporting goods  and women s accessories  consisting of belts  small leather goods  and gifts 
the overall negative retail environment and general economic conditions which the global economy began to experience over a year ago are showing signs of modest improvement  but there seems to be little consensus on when a complete economic recovery may occur 
like most companies in the retail industry  our net sales  and resulting profitability  have been severely impacted beginning in fiscal our customers generally have indicated they are taking a very conservative approach toward replenishing inventory in this environment 
as a result  we have made the necessary adjustments internally to respond to these indications  and we continue to work closely with our retail partners to develop products and programs to fit their needs and the current environment 
our operating results for fiscal were not only affected by lower net sales  but also the need to recognize that million of accounts receivable may not be collectible due to several of our customers deteriorating financial condition and bankruptcy filings 
these customers accounted for approximately and of our net sales in the first half of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal was also negatively impacted by a million inventory write down described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
in connection with an organizational restructuring plan announced in january  we recorded charges for termination payments relating to an approximately salaried employee headcount reduction  and other costs 
for the year  we had a net loss of million  or per share 
in fiscal  we had a net loss of million  or per share 
the following presents sales and gross margin data for our reportable segments in thousands of dollars 
other financial information about our segments is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 

table of contents increase decrease net sales men s accessories women s accessories gross margin men s accessories women s accessories gross margin percent of sales men s accessories women s accessories total our sales are generally affected by changes in demand for our product categories volume as well as customer allowances and returns 
sales volume also can impact our gross margins in terms of product mix between mass merchant retailers  which typically sell product at lower price points than department stores  and specialty retailers 
the components of our cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
we include the costs related to our distribution network in sg a while others may include all or a portion of such costs in their cost of goods sold 
consequently  our gross margins may not be comparable to others

table of contents operationally  the most significant challenges in fiscal were maintaining gross margins and controlling sg a expenses as net sales for fiscal declined from the fiscal level which was lower than the prior year  and transitioning management to a new senior executive team and implementing restructuring plans as long time executives retired 
we implemented an aggressive product life cycle management program and have moved away from low margin products with either small shipping quantities or slow turnover rates 
to facilitate implementation of the product life cycle management program  we decided to liquidate inventories requiring excessive resources by reducing selling prices or scrapping items which might be difficult to sell under current market conditions 
consequently  we recorded a million noncash inventory write down reflecting our best estimate of the market values we anticipate realizing based on our experiences selling through inventory liquidation channels 
actual amounts realized from the marked down inventory may differ from our estimates and such differences could have a material impact on our future results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
compared to net sales and gross margins our million fiscal net sales were lower than the prior year with an improved gross margin of which includes a percentage point effect of the inventory write down 
the gross margin in fiscal on net sales of million included an inventory write down effect of percentage points 
men s accessories segment net sales of million in fiscal were below the million in fiscal as the continuing decline in economic conditions further slowed retailers sales of belts and small leather goods 
fewer belt sales to our largest customer accounted for almost half of the lower men s accessories sales and a million decline in small leather goods sales was partly offset by a million improvement in sales of gifts 
the men s accessories fiscal sales decline was offset by lower discounts and allowances for returns approximating million primarily for our gift products 
women s accessories segment net sales of million in fiscal were below the million in fiscal as economic conditions affected its sales of small leather goods 
gross margin dollars in fiscal generally were lower as the result of lower sales and a million inventory write down which negatively impacted the margin percentage by percentage points 
the fiscal gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by percentage points due to an million inventory write down that year 
the margin percentage of net sales for our men s accessories segment in fiscal improved by percentage points over fiscal and both years were affected by inventory write downs fiscal million  or margin percentage points  fiscal million  or margin percentage points 
the women s accessories segment included inventory write downs of million in fiscal percentage point margin effect and million in fiscal percentage point margin effect 
our gross margin percentages also are affected by direct shipments to our customers which are not handled in our distribution centers because higher gross margins are not required to cover distribution costs which would be included in sg a expenses 
any material changes in sales mix  such as higher mass merchant accessory sales or direct shipments  could lower our gross margin percentages during a particular season 
operating expenses total sg a expenses have been reduced million over the last two years with a  or million  reduction in fiscal reflecting distribution cost savings of million and other cost saving initiatives 
fiscal includes a million provision for doubtful accounts receivable and restructuring costs of   associated with headcount reductions 
fiscal includes million in restructuring costs closing west bend  wisconsin distribution facility  terminating staff at other locations  remaining rent under a lease for a vacated office  other initiatives 
fiscal operating expenses include charges of million for the impairment of our men s accessories segment goodwill million and customer lists million as we significantly revised projections of our future operating results in light of changing business conditions and lower fiscal sales 

table of contents interest and taxes interest expense for fiscal includes a  write off of previously capitalized costs due to amending our current credit facility  but was lower than fiscal as both our borrowings and  for most of the year  interest rates were lower 
fiscal interest expense includes  of costs related to a debt covenant waiver we received for the first quarter and  related to costs previously capitalized for the credit facility with our previous lenders 
because we incurred a net loss in fiscal  we do not owe any federal income taxes and  together with the loss in fiscal  we have a federal income tax net loss carryover of million expiring in and part of the fiscal loss was carried back and we received a million tax refund this year 
our effective income tax rates were a negative in fiscal and in fiscal in both years the benefits of the federal statutory rate applied to our pretax losses were offset by deferred tax valuation allowances fiscal  fiscal and  in fiscal  by an additional for goodwill impairment which was not tax deductible 
the valuation allowances are recorded as our operating results over the past three years and revised projections of future operating results do not currently indicate it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets of our us operations will ultimately be realized 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this difference is primarily due to lower sales and accounts receivable and inventory reductions which provided cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the sales level allowed us to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses by million 
to bridge the timing gap between inventory purchases and collection of accounts receivable  our credit facility provides us with funds on a revolving basis 
in fiscal  periodic borrowings totaled million and repayments totaled million 
in fiscal periodic borrowings totaled million and repayments totaled million 
the larger amounts this year were due to an increase in the frequency of borrowing and repayment 
capital expenditures for property and equipment of million were primarily in support of inventory management and other computer related applications 
other investing activity was the million funding of the supplemental executive retirement plan 
financing activities in fiscal included credit facility short term borrowings and repayments resulting in a million net debt reduction for the year  and dividend payments of million 
in order to preserve capital and enhance financial flexibility  dividend payments were suspended after the first quarter of fiscal our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our credit facility which we believe can provide adequate financial resources for our future working capital needs even though the facility was amended effective march  to reduce the credit limit from million to million and adjust the tangible net worth financial ratio because we did not meet the pre amendment ratio at that date 
we expect to replace our current credit facility before it expires in february  but an inability to do so on favorable terms could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial position 
information about our credit facility is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
at june   we had million borrowing availability and no outstanding borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we use estimates throughout our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made or changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our 
table of contents financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are presented below 
revenues and accounts receivable allowances sales are recognized when merchandise is shipped and title to the goods has passed to the customer 
we record allowances  including cash discounts  in store customer allowances  cooperative advertising allowances  and customer returns  as a reduction of sales based upon historical experience  current trends in the retail industry  and individual customer and product experience 
actual returns and allowances may differ from our estimates and differences would affect the operating results of subsequent periods 
sensitivity analysis the following table presents the estimated effect of the indicated increase decrease in our sales  based on fiscal net sales of million  on our allowance for doubtful accounts in thousands except per share amounts 
changes in general economic conditions  trends and developments within our industry  or situations unique to specific customers could result in significant fluctuations in the actual effects of these estimates 
sales allowances earnings change reserves expense per share change in customer allowances and returns change in allowance for doubtful accounts inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes the direct cost of purchased products and  for manufactured products  materials  direct and indirect labor  and factory overhead 
market  with respect to raw materials  is replacement cost and  with respect to work in process and finished goods  is net realizable value 
in our assessment of the value of inventory  we monitor retailer sell through rates  fashion trends  and the accumulation of excess inventory 
our assessment is both a quantitative measurement eg  the use of metrics such as the number of months supply on hand and qualitative measurement eg  the ability to utilize certain styles in current and future programs 
in general we have relationships with off price store customers that will purchase excess inventory at discounted prices and we have been able to realize values at or above the lower of cost or market values at which we carry our inventories 
if circumstances arise in which the market value of items in inventory declines below cost  an inventory markdown is estimated and charged to expense in the period identified 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
sensitivity analysis the effect of a write down in the value of our june  inventory would be in thousands except per share amounts percentage earnings of inventory inventory expense per share change in inventory markdown uncertain tax positions tax liabilities  together with interest and applicable penalties  are recognized for the benefits of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements which more likely than not may not be realized 
we review the appropriateness of items of revenue or expense excluded or included in our tax returns and the requirements for filing returns with jurisdictions which may have laws requiring us to file tax returns 
failure to recognize a tax liability for the benefits of an uncertain tax position which ultimately is not realized could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
share based compensation the fair values of restricted stock and performance unit grants payable in stock are estimated to be the market price of our common stock on the grant dates and  for performance units  reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends 
the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our stock options are based on historical information and current economic conditions 
estimated fair values increase if the expected dividend yield decreases and the other assumptions increase 
neither the grant date market values of our stock nor the resulting 
table of contents output of the black scholes option pricing model using our assumptions may be the value ultimately realized by our directors and employees or accurately measure the tax benefits we may realize
