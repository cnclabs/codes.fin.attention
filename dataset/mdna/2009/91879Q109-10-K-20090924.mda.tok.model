overview the company s operations are grouped into three integrated and interdependent segments mountain  lodging and real estate 
resort is the combination of the mountain and lodging segments 
revenue from the mountain  lodging and real estate segments represented  and  respectively  of the company s net revenue for fiscal mountain segment the mountain segment is comprised of the operations of five ski resort properties as well as ancillary businesses  primarily including ski school  dining and retail rental operations 
the company s five ski resorts were open for business for the ski season from mid november through mid april  which is the peak operating season for the mountain segment 
the company s single largest source of mountain segment revenue is the sale of lift tickets including season passes  which represented approximately  and of mountain segment net revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
lift ticket revenue is driven by volume and pricing 
pricing is impacted by both absolute pricing as well as the demographic mix of guests  which impacts the price points at which various products are purchased 
the demographic mix of guests is divided into two primary categories i destination guests and ii in state guests 
for the ski season  destination guests comprised approximately of the company s skier visits  while in state guests comprised approximately of the company s skier visits  which compares to approximately and  respectively  for the ski season and and  respectively  for the ski season 
destination guests generally purchase the company s higher priced lift ticket products and utilize more ancillary services such as ski school  dining and retail rental  as well as the lodging at or around the company s resorts 
destination guest visitation is less likely to be impacted by changes in the weather due to the advance planning generally required for vacation trips  but can be more impacted by adverse economic conditions or the global geopolitical climate 
in state guests tend to be more value oriented and weather sensitive 
prior to the ski season  the company primarily marketed season passes to in state guests in an effort to offer a value option in turn for a commitment predominately prior to the beginning of the ski season by in state guests to ski at the company s resorts 
this in turn has developed a loyal customer base that generally skis multiple days each season at the company s resorts and provides a more stabilized stream of lift revenue to the company 
given the success of in state pass products  the company introduced a new season pass product the epic season pass for the ski season  marketed to its destination guests and also marketed to in state guests allowing pass holders unlimited and unrestricted access to all five of its ski resorts during the entire ski season 
all of the company s season pass products  including the epic season pass  are sold predominately prior to the start of the ski season 
season pass revenue  although primarily collected prior to the ski season  is recognized in the consolidated condensed statement of operations ratably over the ski season 
for the  and ski season approximately  and  respectively  of total lift revenue recognized was comprised of season pass revenue 
the cost structure of ski resort operations is primarily fixed  with variable expenses including  but not limited to  usda forest service forest service fees  credit card fees  retail rental cost of goods sold and labor  ski school labor and dining operations  as such  profit margins can fluctuate greatly based on the level of revenues 
lodging segment operations within the lodging segment include i ownership management of a group of luxury hotels through the rockresorts brand  including several proximate to the company s ski resorts  ii ownership management of non rockresorts branded hotels and condominiums proximate to the company s ski resorts  iii grand teton lodge company gtlc  iv colorado mountain express cme  a resort ground transportation company acquired in november  and v golf courses 
lodging properties including managed condominium rooms at or around the company s ski resorts  and cme  are closely aligned with the performance of the mountain segment  particularly with respect to visitation by destination guests and represented approximately  and of lodging segment revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenue of the lodging segment during the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters is generated primarily by the operations of gtlc as gtlc s operating season generally occurs from mid may to mid october  golf operations and seasonally low operations from the company s other owned and managed properties as well as cme 
real estate segment the real estate segment owns and develops real estate in and around the company s resort communities and primarily engages in the vertical development of projects  as well as  occasionally the sale of land to third party developers which often includes a contingent revenue structure based on the ultimate sale of the developed units 
revenue from vertical development projects is not recognized until closing of individual units within a project which occurs after substantial completion of the project 
contingent future profits from land sales  if any  are recognized only when received 
the company attempts to mitigate the risk of vertical development by often utilizing guaranteed maximum price construction contracts although certain construction costs may not be covered by contractual limitations  pre selling a portion of the project  requiring significant non refundable deposits  and potentially obtaining non recourse financing for certain projects 
the company s real estate development projects also may result in the creation of certain resort assets that provide additional benefit to the mountain and lodging segments 
the company s revenue from the real estate segment  and associated expense  fluctuate based upon the timing of closings and the type of real estate being sold  causing volatility in the real estate segment s operating results from period to period 
recent trends  risks and uncertainties the data provided in this section should be read in conjunction with the risk factors identified in item a and elsewhere in this form k 
the company s management has identified the following important factors as well as uncertainties associated with such factors that could impact the company s future financial performance the economic recession that has affected the us and global economies  the tightened credit markets and eroded consumer confidence had a negative impact on overall trends in the travel and leisure industries and on the company s results of operations for fiscal in this environment  the company experienced a decrease in overall skier visitation for the ski season and a percentage point decrease in occupancy at the company s owned hotels and managed condominium properties all proximate to the company s ski resorts for fiscal additionally  the company experienced  a decrease in overall guest spending on ancillary services  including ski school  dining and retail rental 
furthermore  the company experienced a change in booking trends such that guest reservations were made much closer to the actual date of stay 
the company cannot predict the extent to which these negative trends will continue  worsen or improve or the timing and nature of any changes to the macroeconomic environment  including the impact it may have on the company s future results of operations  in particular on the ski season 
the timing and amount of snowfall can have an impact on mountain and lodging revenue particularly in regards to skier visits and the duration and frequency of guest visitation 
to mitigate this impact  the company focuses efforts on the sale of season passes prior to the beginning of the season to in state guests and destination guests 
additionally  the company has invested in snowmaking upgrades in an effort to address the inconsistency of early season snowfall where possible 
during the past two ski seasons  early season snowfall has been significantly lower than average  which the company believes had a negative impact on early season visitation 
the company s season pass products provide a value option to its guests which in turn provides a guest commitment predominately prior to the start of the ski season resulting in a more stabilized stream of lift revenue for the company 
the company introduced the epic season pass for the ski season  which largely contributed to season pass revenue as a percentage of total lift revenue increasing from for the ski season to for the ski season 
in march  the company began its pass sales campaign for the ski season  including the epic season pass  and as of july  season pass sales have increased million  or  compared to season pass sales as of july  for the ski season 
the company cannot predict if this trend will continue through the fall pass sales campaign or the impact that season pass sales may have on total lift revenue or etp for the ski season 
the company has historically implemented annual price increases 
however  the company held prices flat for most multi day lift ticket and certain other products and services for the ski season 
prices for the ski season have not yet been finalized  and as such there are no assurances as to the level of price increases  if any  which will occur or the impact that pricing may have on visitation or revenue 
the company operates its ski areas under various forest service permits  and many of the company s operations require permits and approval from governmental authorities  therefore many of the company s on mountain capital improvements must go through an approval process 
changes or impacts to the applicable regulatory environment may have detrimental effects on the company 
real estate reported ebitda is highly dependent on  among other things  the timing of closings on real estate under contract  which determines when revenue and associated cost of sales is recognized 
changes to the anticipated timing or mix of closing on one or more real estate projects  or unit closings within a real estate project  could materially impact real estate reported ebitda for a particular quarter or fiscal year 
the company has two real estate projects currently under development which are scheduled to be completed in the spring summer of one ski hill place in breckenridge and the fall of the ritz carlton residences  vail and has entered into definitive sales contracts with a value of approximately million  which represents approximately of the total current estimated sales value for these two projects 
the company has increased risk associated with selling and closing real estate as a result of the continued instability in the capital and credit markets and slowdown in the overall real estate market 
in april  in response to current market conditions  the company announced a reduction of approximately to the listed selling prices of its ritz carlton residences  vail  as well as price reductions of approximately for purchasers currently under contract 
the company cannot predict the ultimate number of units that it will sell  the ultimate price it will receive  or when the units will sell 
additionally  if a more severe prolonged economic downturn were to occur the company may have to further adjust its selling prices in an effort to sell and close on units currently under development  although it currently has no plans to do so 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents as of july  as well as million available under the revolver component of its credit facility 
the company s plan to continue to self fund its current real estate projects under construction the company estimates to incur between million and million in cash expenditures subsequent to july  combined with historically low operating cash flows during the company s first fiscal quarter will likely require the company to borrow under the revolver component of its credit facility from time to time beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company currently believes it has adequate capacity under its revolver to address potential borrowing needs  even in the event of a more sustained negative economic environment 
under gaap  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually  which the company does so during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of its reporting units and terminal values of the businesses using projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
the company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams 
the company s annual impairment test did not result in a goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment see critical accounting policies in this section of this form k 
however  if a more severe prolonged economic downturn were to occur it could cause less than expected growth and or reduction in terminal values of the company s reporting units which may result in a goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge attributable to certain goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets  particularly related to its lodging and retail rental operations

fiscal compared to fiscal lift revenue decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  decline in lift revenue excluding season pass revenue  partially offset by an increase in season pass revenue of million  or 
the increase in season pass revenue was driven by higher season pass sales resulting primarily from the introduction of the epic season pass in the ski season

real estate segment real estate segment operating results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are presented by category as follows in thousands percentage year ended july  increase decrease total real estate net revenue total real estate operating expense gain on sale of real property total real estate reported ebitda total real estate reported ebitda includes million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s real estate operating revenue is primarily determined by the timing of closings and the mix of real estate sold in any given period 
different types of projects have different revenue and expense volumes and margins  therefore  as the real estate inventory mix changes it can greatly impact real estate segment net revenue  operating expense and real estate reported ebitda 
fiscal real estate net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closings of eight chalets units million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  residences at crystal peak lodge million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  and two condominium units at the arrabelle million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the higher average price per square foot for the chalet units was driven by their premier location at the base of vail mountain in vail village and the fact that this development consisted of only exclusive chalets 
the arrabelle average price per square foot is driven by its ski in ski out location in vail  and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
the crystal peak lodge average price per square foot though significantly lower than the vail project real estate sales  is significantly higher than historical breckenridge project real estate sales and is primarily driven by its ski in ski out location at the base of peak in breckenridge and close proximity to the breckconnect gondola 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million commensurate with revenue recognized  primarily driven by the closing on eight chalets units million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  residences at crystal peak lodge million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of and two units at the arrabelle million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for the arrabelle and chalets are reflective of the high end features and amenities associated with these projects and the relatively high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
the cost per square foot for crystal peak lodge is reflective of its less complicated design features and fewer amenities associated with this project relative to the arrabelle and chalets 
operating expenses also included sales commissions of approximately million commensurate with revenue recognized and general and administrative costs of approximately million including million of stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative costs were primarily comprised of marketing expenses for the major real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
in addition  included in segment operating expense for fiscal  the company recorded million of estimated costs in excess of anticipated sales proceeds for an affordable housing commitment resulting from the cancellation of a contract by a third party developer related to its jhg tc development 
fiscal real estate net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closings of condominium units at the arrabelle million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  the closings of five chalet units million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  the closings of the remaining jhg tc cabins million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of and contingent gains of million on development parcel sales that closed in previous periods 
the higher average price per square foot for the chalet units was driven by the premier location at the base of vail mountain in vail village and the fact that this development consisted of only exclusive chalets 
the arrabelle average price per square foot is driven by its ski in ski out location in vail  and the comprehensive offering of amenities resulting from this project 
the jhg tc cabins yielded a lower price per square foot as its location is proximate to golf and tennis facilities which does not have as strong of a demand compared to real estate featuring ski in ski out locations proximate to our ski resorts 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million commensurate with revenue recognized  primarily driven by the closing on units at the arrabelle million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  the closing on five chalet units million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  and the closing of the remaining jhg tc cabins million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for the arrabelle and chalets are reflective of the high end features and amenities associated with these projects and the relatively high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
the average cost per square foot for the jhg tc was significantly lower than for other projects closed during the period due to the fact that this project did not include the typical high end features of our projects that are in close proximity to our mountain resorts  however  the cost of sales for the jhg tc cabins were relatively high compared to the revenue earned due to unanticipated incremental design and construction related costs 
operating expenses also included sales commissions of approximately million commensurate with revenue recognized and general and administrative costs of approximately million including million of stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative costs were primarily comprised of marketing expenses for the major real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
fiscal real estate net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by the closings of ten residences at gore creek place million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of  residences at mountain thunder million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of and cabins at jhg tc million of revenue with an average selling price per unit of million and an average price per square foot of 
the higher average price per square foot for the gore creek place units was driven by its location in vail s lionshead village and the fact that this development consisted of only exclusive townhomes 
the mountain thunder average price per square foot is reflective of its location not at the base area of the ski mountain in breckenridge 
the jhg tc cabins yielded a lower price per square foot as its location is proximate to golf and tennis facilities which does not have as strong of a demand compared to real estate featuring ski in ski out locations proximate to our ski resorts 
in addition  real estate net revenue included the sale of land together with certain related infrastructure improvements in red sky ranch and breckenridge to third party developers of million  the sale of the sole asset in the fft investment partners real estate joint venture of million and contingent gains on development parcel sales that closed in previous periods of million 
operating expense for fiscal included cost of sales of million commensurate with revenue recognized  primarily driven by the closing on ten residences at gore creek place million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  residences at mountain thunder million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of  and cabins at jhg tc million in cost of sales with an average cost per square foot of 
the cost per square foot for the gore creek place is reflective of the high end features associated with the projects and the relatively high construction costs associated with mountain resort development 
the average cost per square foot for the mountain thunder and jhg tc was significantly lower than for other projects closed during the period due to the fact that the projects did not include the typical high end features of our projects that are at the base of our mountain resorts 
in addition  the cost of sales for the jhg tc cabins were relatively high compared to the revenue earned due to unanticipated incremental design and construction related costs  which resulted in a million charge for estimated total project costs in excess of anticipated sales proceeds which was recorded during fiscal operating expenses also included sales commissions of approximately million commensurate with revenue recognized and general and administrative costs of approximately million including million of stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative costs were primarily comprised of marketing expenses for the major real estate projects under development including those that have not yet closed  overhead costs such as labor and labor related benefits and allocated corporate costs 
other items in addition to segment operating results  the following material items contribute to the company s overall financial position 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal and fiscal increased primarily due to a higher level of capital expenditures and the timing of placing in service significant resort assets  which included  among other assets  the arrabelle including amenities such as a private club  spa  commercial leasing space  and other skier services facilities  a new skier services building  a private club the vail mountain club in vail village and multiple gondolas and lifts within the last two years 
investment income 
the decrease in investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a reduction in the average interest earned on investments the average annualized interest rate earned decreased by approximately percentage points in fiscal versus fiscal  as well as a decrease in average invested cash during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in investment income for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a reduction in the average interest earned on investments  a decrease in average invested cash during the period and a million impairment on a short term investment resulting from a commercial paper write down 
interest expense  net 
the reduction in interest expense  net for fiscal compared to fiscal  is attributable to the payoff of a scheduled debt maturity in the current year and capitalized interest on self funded real estate projects 
the decrease in interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a reduction in the average variable borrowing rate of the employee housing bonds and an increase in capitalized interest associated with real estate and related resort development

the company has historically invested significant cash in capital expenditures for its resort operations  and expects to continue to invest in the future  however  plans for such investment in the near term have been reduced given the significant level of capital expenditures made in the past few years including individually significant projects that do not annually re occur including gondolas and major hotel renovations coupled with the current economic recession

the most restrictive of those covenants include the following credit facility covenants net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  interest coverage ratio and the minimum net worth each as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  the company s financing arrangements  including the indenture  limit its ability to incur certain indebtedness  make certain restricted payments  enter into certain investments  make certain affiliate transfers and may limit its ability to enter into certain mergers  consolidations or sales of assets 
the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is primarily determined by the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio  which is based on the company s segment operating performance  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in its debt instruments as of july  the company expects it will meet all applicable financial maintenance covenants in its credit agreement  including the net funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio throughout the year ending july  however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet such financial covenants 
if such covenants are not met  the company would be required to seek a waiver or amendment from the banks participating in the credit facility 
while the company anticipates that it would obtain such waiver or amendment  if any were necessary  there can be no assurance that such waiver or amendment would be granted  which could have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of the company 
contractual obligations as part of its ongoing operations  the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements  construction agreements in conjunction with the company s development activities and lease agreements 
debt obligations  which total million as of july   are recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of july  obligations under construction contracts are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet until services and or goods are received which is in accordance with gaap 
additionally  operating lease and service contract obligations  which total million as of july   are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet  which is in accordance with gaap 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of july  is as follows in thousands payments due by period fiscal more than contractual obligations total years years years long term debt fixed rate interest operating leases and service contracts purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the fixed rate interest payments  as well as long term debt payments  included in the table above assume that all fixed rate debt outstanding as of july  will be held to maturity 
interest payments associated with variable rate debt have not been included in the table 
assuming that the amounts outstanding under variable rate long term debt as of july  are held to maturity  and utilizing interest rates in effect at july   the company s annual interest payments including commitment fees and letter of credit fees on variable rate long term debt as of july  is anticipated to be approximately million for at least each of the next five years 
the future annual interest obligations noted herein are estimated only in relation to debt outstanding as of july   and do not reflect interest obligations on potential future debt

the company has identified the most critical accounting policies which were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company also has other policies considered key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require the company to make estimates or judgments that are complex or subjective 
the company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the company s audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate revenue and cost of sales 
description the company utilizes the relative sales value method to determine cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate and or condominium units sold within a project  when specific identification of costs cannot be reasonably determined 
the determination of cost of sales may utilize estimates for the fair value of resort depreciable assets that may be part of a mixed use real estate development project and total costs to be incurred on a real estate development project 
judgments and uncertainties changes to either the relative sales values of the components of a project  which may include resort depreciable assets  or the total projected costs to be incurred to determine cost of sales may cause significant variances in the profit margins recognized on individual parcels of real estate and or condominium units within a project 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions a change in the estimates of either the relative sales values of the components of a project or remaining costs to be incurred for projects utilizing the relative sales value method would have changed the profit margin recognized by approximately million for fiscal goodwill and intangible assets 
description the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset below its carrying value 
other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
the company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
judgments and uncertainties application of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company determines the estimated fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimated fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is primarily determined using the income approach based upon estimated future revenue streams 
these analyses require significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  available industry market data  estimation of the long term rate of growth for the company s business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur including terminal multiples  and determination of the respective weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset 
the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis and allocates goodwill to its reporting units based on the reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition generating the goodwill 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are at least tested for impairment annually as of may st of each year 
based upon the company s annual impairment test during the fourth fiscal quarter of the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values 
as such  no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets was recorded 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value calculations of the company s reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets  the company applied a hypothetical decrease to the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets 
this hypothetical decrease of would not have had an impact on the conclusion that the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units and significant indefinite lived intangible assets were in excess of their respective carrying values 
tax contingencies 
description the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires the company to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
a significant amount of time may pass before a particular matter  for which the company may have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the potential exposure associated with the company s various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable and it has adequate reserves for its tax contingencies  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increases or decreases in those reserves and tax provisions that could be material 
an unfavorable tax settlement could require the use of cash and could possibly result in an increased tax expense and effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could possibly result in a reduction in the company s tax expense  effective tax rate  income taxes payable  other long term liabilities and or adjustments to its deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities or intangible assets in the year of settlement or in future years 
depreciable lives of assets 
description mountain and lodging operational assets  furniture and fixtures  computer equipment  software  vehicles and leasehold improvements are primarily depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets may become obsolete or require replacement before the end of their useful life in which the remaining book value would be written off or the company could incur costs to remove or dispose of assets no longer in use 
judgments and uncertainties the estimates of the company s useful life of the assets contain uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate the useful life of the asset 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and the company may be exposed to increased expense related to depreciable assets disposed of  removed or taken out of service prior to its originally estimated useful life  which may be material 
a decrease in the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets would have increased depreciation expense by approximately million for fiscal new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
this fsp delayed the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november  the company s fiscal year ending july  and interim periods within the fiscal year of adoption 
the adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities was effective for the company on august  and did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of the provisions of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree  including the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
sfas r will be applicable prospectively to business combinations consummated after july  the company s fiscal year ending july  
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity within the balance sheet 
currently  noncontrolling interests minority interests are reported as a liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet and the related income loss attributable to minority interests is reflected as an expense credit in arriving at net income 
upon adoption of sfas  the company will be required to report its minority interests as a separate component of stockholders equity and present net income allocable to the minority interests along with net income attributable to the stockholders of the company separately in its consolidated statement of operations 
sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements of sfas shall be applied prospectively 
the requirements of sfas are effective for the company beginning august  the company s fiscal year ending july  
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp which establishes a new model for measuring other than temporary impairments for debt securities  including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write down through earnings versus other comprehensive income 
the fsp also requires additional interim and annual disclosures for impaired securities 
the requirements of the fsp were effective for the company as of july  and did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  subsequent events sfas which establishes the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
sfas requires entities to recognize in their financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet  including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements 
entities shall not recognize subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose subsequent to that date 
in addition  entities are required to disclose the period through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the provisions of sfas were effective for the company as of july  in june  the fasb issued sfas  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r sfas which amends the consolidation guidance under fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
sfas requires entities to perform a qualitative assessment in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the qualitative assessment includes  among other things  consideration as to whether a variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
pursuant to sfas  the requirement to assess whether an entity should be deemed the primary beneficiary is an on going reconsideration 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the company beginning august  the company s fiscal year ending july  
the company is currently evaluating the impacts  if any  the adoption of the provisions of sfas will have on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increase  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenue and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses from late spring to late fall 
conversely  peak operating seasons for gtlc  certain managed hotel properties and the company s owned golf courses occur during the summer months while the winter season results in operating losses 
revenue and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations  management fees from certain managed properties  certain other lodging properties and golf operations are not nearly sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and other lodging operations 
during fiscal  of total combined mountain and lodging segment net revenue was earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing of the company s total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during fiscal of 
based on variable rate borrowings outstanding as of july   a basis point or change in libor would result in the company s annual interest payments to change by million 
the company s market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
