the agreement is non exclusive and sets forth the terms and conditions under which pirelli may purchase our femtocell products 
the initial term of the agreement extends through november  with automatic annual renewals  unless either party gives days notice of its intent not to renew 
qualcomm we have a supply and distribution agreement with qualcomm for our ipbts products 
the agreement has no minimum purchase commitments and sets forth the terms and conditions under which qualcomm may purchase such products 
qualcomm has the exclusive right in north america to distribute our ipbts products for networks that are not intended to be permanently installed 
the term of the agreement extends through july  in january  we entered into an agreement with qualcomm to develop and commercialize certain ev do software products for qualcomm 
the term of the agreement extends through january sales and marketing we market and sell our products both indirectly through our oem customers and directly to wireless operator customers 
to date  substantially all of our sales have been through our oem customers 
in addition to our sales and marketing efforts directed towards oem customers  we augment the sales efforts of our oem customers by working with their delivery and operational teams and assisting in the training and support of their sales personnel 
increasingly  an important part of our sales effort is creating demand for our products by working directly with operators 
we foster relationships with operators by discussing technology trends  identifying market requirements  carrying out field support trials of our technologies in conjunction with teams from our oem customers and 
table of contents providing training and education related to our technology 
through these contacts with our end customers  we believe we are better able to understand their operations  incorporate feature and product requirements into our solutions and better track the technology needs of our end customers 
as of december   we had employees in sales and marketing 
service and support we offer technical support services to our oem customers and  in some cases  directly to wireless operators 
our oem customers are responsible for handling basic first level customer support  with our technical support personnel addressing complex issues related to our technologies 
our service and support efforts are divided into two main categories ongoing commercial network support  and pre commercial or new network rollout support 
our ongoing customer support and services include live network product rollout  around the clock technical support  software and hardware maintenance services  emergency outage recovery and service ticket tracking and management 
pre commercial support services include deployment optimization services  customer network engineering and on site deployment work related to system configuration and integration with existing infrastructure 
we also provide customer consulting services including network and radio frequency deployment planning  network optimization and overall performance management 
our products and technology are sold with a full range of technical documentation  including planning  installation and operation guides 
we also provide standard and customized training targeted at management  operational support personnel and network planners and engineers 
as of december   we had employees in service and support 
research and development investment in research and development is at the core of our business strategy 
as of december   we had engineers in chelmsford  massachusetts  bangalore  india and cambridge  united kingdom with significant expertise in digital communications  including wireless communications  ip and broadband networking 
our research and development organization is responsible for designing  developing and enhancing our software and hardware products  performing product testing and quality assurance activities  and ensuring the compatibility of our products with third party platforms 
our research and development organization is also responsible for developing new algorithms and concepts for our existing and future products 
we have made substantial investments in product and technology development since our inception 
research and development expense totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect our research and development expense to increase for certain product areas  primarily related to our investment in fmc products  but decrease overall from fiscal manufacturing and operations we develop and test our software products in house and outsource the manufacturing of the carrier grade hardware components of our products 
we believe that outsourcing the manufacturing of these hardware components enables us to conserve working capital  better adjust manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand and more quickly deliver products 
as of december   we had employees in manufacturing and operations 
competition the market for network infrastructure products is highly competitive and rapidly evolving 
the market is subject to changing technology trends  shifting customer needs and expectations and frequent introduction of new products 
we believe we are able to compete successfully primarily on the basis of our expertise in all ip wireless communication  the performance and reliability of our products and our oem business model 

table of contents the nature of our competition varies by product 
for our ev do products  we face competition from several of the world s largest telecommunications equipment providers that offer either a directly competitive product or a product based on alternative technologies 
our competitors include alcatel lucent  hitachi  huawei  lg nortel and samsung 
in our sales to oem customers  we face the competitive risk that oems might seek to develop in house alternative solutions to those currently licensed from us 
additionally  oems might elect to source technology from our competitors 
the market for fmc solutions is in its early stages 
we expect to encounter competition from products already on the market  as well as new products to be developed 
our competition includes several public companies  including cisco  ericsson and samsung  as well as several private companies  including huawei 
our current and potential new competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  many of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do  including relationships with our potential customers 
our competitors may therefore be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to market or sell their products more effectively 
moreover  further consolidation in the communications equipment market could adversely affect our oem customer relationships and competitive position 
our products may not continue to compete favorably and we may not be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering the markets in which we provide products 
intellectual property we believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology  the skills of our employees and the ability of our employees to continue to innovate and incorporate advances in wireless communication technology into our products 
we regard our products and the internally developed software embedded in our products as proprietary 
the wireless industry is dominated by large vendors with significant intellectual property portfolios 
to establish and protect our own intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws 
as of february   we had been issued patents  with additional patents allowed and had over patent applications pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions 
we license our technology pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on customers ability to use the technology  such as prohibiting reverse engineering and  in the case of software products  limiting the use of software copies and restricting access to our source code 
we also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property using contractual obligations  by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute nondisclosure  non compete and assignment of intellectual property agreements 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our means to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products  obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  or even elect to design around our current intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and many foreign countries do not enforce their intellectual property laws as diligently as us government agencies and private parties 
litigation and associated expenses may be necessary to enforce our property rights 
we have licensed from qualcomm some of its ev do technology for use in our products 
our software also relies on certain application specific integrated circuit  or asic  technology from qualcomm used in ev do products 
an inability to access these asic technologies could result in significant delays in our product releases and could require substantial effort to locate or develop replacement technology 
many companies in the wireless industry have significant patent portfolios 
these companies and other parties may claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights 
we may become involved in litigation as a result of 
table of contents allegations that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
for example  we have received letters from wi lan inc asserting that some of our products infringe four issued united states patents and an issued canadian patent relating to wireless communication technologies 
a majority of our revenue to date has been derived from the allegedly infringing ev do products 
we have evaluated various matters relating to wi lan s assertion and we do not believe that our products infringe any valid claim of the patents identified by wi lan 
however  we may seek to obtain a license to use the relevant technology from wi lan 
we cannot be certain that wi lan would provide such a license or  if provided  what its economic terms would be 
if we were to seek to obtain such a license  and such license were available from wi lan  we could be required to make significant payments with respect to past and or future sales of our products  and such payments may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
if wi lan determines to pursue claims against us for patent infringement  we might not be able to successfully defend against such claims 
employees as of december   we had approximately employees  of which approximately were located in india  approximately were located in the united kingdom and the vast majority of the remainder were based in the united states 
none of our employees is represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
facilities our corporate headquarters is located in chelmsford  massachusetts  where we lease approximately  square feet of office space 
this lease expires on april  we also lease approximately  square feet of space in bangalore  india pursuant to a lease which expires in march and approximately  square feet of space in cambridge  united kingdom pursuant to leases which expire in february and august legal proceedings from time to time  we may be involved in disputes or litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations 
we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings 
item a 
risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks 
we caution you that the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec  press releases  communications with investors and oral statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they may be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the sec 
risks relating to our business we depend on a single oem customer that recently filed for bankruptcy protection  nortel networks  for almost all of our revenue and billings  and a significant shortfall in sales to nortel networks would significantly harm our business and operating results 
we derived almost all of our revenue and billings in each of the last several years from sales to a single oem customer  nortel networks 
nortel networks accounted for of our revenue and of our billings in fiscal  of our revenue and of our billings in fiscal and of our revenue and of our billings in fiscal on january   nortel networks announced that it and certain of its affiliates had filed for bankruptcy protection 
at the time of that filing  we had million in outstanding invoices to nortel networks and approximately million to million of unbilled amounts related to royalties earned through january  the collection of these amounts is subject to nortel networks bankruptcy proceedings and it is likely that a 
table of contents portion or all of these amounts will not be collected 
as a result  we have excluded the million of outstanding invoices to nortel networks from accounts receivable and deferred revenue as of december  and billings for the quarter and year ended december  since the date of nortel networks bankruptcy filing  we and nortel networks have continued to deliver products and services to nortel networks cdma ev do wireless operators under the terms of nortel networks existing agreement with us 
we are continuing to incur costs related to the research and development of future software releases for nortel networks 
although we intend to work with nortel networks to have our agreement assumed  there can be no assurance that nortel networks will assume its agreement with us or that we will recover our costs 
if our agreement with nortel networks is assumed  nortel networks will be required to become current in all of its outstanding obligations to us  including obligations outstanding prior to january  if our agreement is not assumed  all outstanding obligations billed and unbilled invoices will be subject to discharge and we likely will not be able to collect these receivables in full 
should nortel networks not assume its agreement with us  we would cease to do business with nortel networks unless we could agree with nortel networks on the terms for a new agreement 
any new terms agreed to could be less favorable to us than our current agreement 
in addition  because of nortel networks bankruptcy filing  operators may slow their purchases of infrastructure solutions from nortel networks  which would harm our business 
furthermore  we anticipate that we will incur some costs related to working with nortel networks to assume our contract and collect our outstanding invoices 
this process could be time consuming and could divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
even if nortel networks agrees to assume our contract  nortel networks can terminate that contract at any time and  in any event  the contract does not contain commitments for future purchases of our products 
the rate at which nortel networks purchases products from us depends on its success in selling to operators its own ev do infrastructure solutions that include our products 
there can be no assurance that nortel networks will continue to devote and invest significant resources and capital to its wireless infrastructure business or that it will be successful in the future in such business 
nortel networks might seek to develop internally  or acquire from a third party  alternative wireless solutions to those currently purchased from us 
in addition  nortel networks may seek to develop an alternative solution by utilizing technology that has been developed by lg electronics  with which nortel networks has a joint venture 
consolidation is common in the telecommunications industry 
should nortel networks merge its wireless infrastructure businesses with another telecommunications company  nortel networks could seek to deploy alternative solutions by utilizing technology that has been developed by the other company 
we expect to derive a substantial majority of our revenue  billings and cash flow in fiscal from nortel networks  and therefore any adverse change in our relationship with nortel networks  or a significant decline or shortfall in our sales to nortel networks  would significantly harm our business and operating results 
because our oem business model requires us to defer the recognition of most of our revenue from product and service sales until we deliver specified upgrades  and in some cases to further defer a portion of our revenue until applicable warranty periods expire  our revenue in any period is not likely to be indicative of the level of our sales activity in that period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products and services under our oem agreements only after we deliver specified upgrades to those products that were committed at the time of sale 
the period of development of these upgrades can range from to months after the date of commitment 
as a result  most of our revenue in any quarter typically reflects license fees under our oem agreements for products and services delivered and invoiced to customers several quarters earlier 
for these products and services  we generally record the amount of the invoice as deferred revenue and then begin to recognize such deferred revenue as revenue upon delivery of the committed software upgrades 
when we cannot establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for our maintenance and support services  we recognize a portion of the product and services revenue based on the portion of the maintenance period that has elapsed when the revenue first becomes recognizable  and we recognize the remaining portion of that product and services revenue ratably over the remaining maintenance period 
as a result  our revenue is not likely to be indicative of the level of our sales activity in any period 
due to our oem business model  we expect that  for the foreseeable future  any quarter in which we recognize a significant amount of deferred revenue as a result of our delivery of a previously committed upgrade will be followed by one or more quarters of insignificant revenue as we defer revenue while we develop additional upgrades 
investors may 
table of contents encounter difficulties in tracking the performance of our business because our revenue will not reflect the level of our billings in any period  and these difficulties could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenue and billings growth may be constrained by our product concentration and lack of revenue diversification 
almost all of our revenue and billings to date have been derived from sales of our ev do products  and we expect ev do revenues to remain a major contributor to revenue for the foreseeable future 
continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success 
the future demand for our ev do products depends  in large part  on the continued expansion of the ev do based wireless networks currently deployed by operators and determinations by additional operators to deploy ev do based wireless networks 
demand for our ev do products also depends on our ability to continue to develop and deliver on a timely basis product upgrades to enable operators to enhance the performance of their networks and implement new mobile broadband services 
any decline in demand for ev do products  or inability on our part to develop and deliver product upgrades that meet the needs of operators  would adversely affect our business and operating results 
a majority of our current products are based exclusively on the cdma air interface standard for wireless communications  and therefore any movement by existing or prospective operator customers to a different standard could impair our business and operating results 
there are multiple competing air interface standards for wireless communications networks 
a majority of our current products are based exclusively on the cdma air interface standard  which handles a majority of wireless subscribers in the united states 
other standards  such as gsm umts  are currently the primary standards used by wireless operators in mobile networks worldwide 
our ev do products do not operate in networks using the gsm umts standards 
we believe there are a limited number of operators that have not already chosen the air interface standard to deploy in their g wireless networks 
our success will therefore depend  to a significant degree  on whether operators that have currently deployed cdma based networks expand and upgrade their networks and whether additional operators that have not yet deployed g networks select cdma as their standard 
our business will be harmed if operators currently utilizing the cdma standard transition their networks to a competing standard and we have not at that time developed and begun to offer competitive products that are compatible with that standard 
our business will also be harmed if operators that have currently deployed both cdma and gsm umts networks determine to focus more of their resources on their gsm umts networks 
the introduction of fourth generation wireless technology could reduce spending on our ev do products and therefore harm our operating results 
the standards for mobile broadband solutions are expected to evolve into a fourth generation of wireless standards  known as g 
wireless operators have announced plans to build networks based on the g standard 
for example  verizon wireless  bell mobility and telus have each announced its intent to build g networks using the long term evolution  or lte  standard and sprint nextel has announced its intent to build a g network using wimax technology 
in addition  bell mobility and telus each recently announced that it will overlay its cdma networks with umts technology as it migrates to the lte standard 
the market for our existing ev do products is likely to decline if and when operators begin to delay expenditures for ev do products in anticipation of the availability of new g based products 
our primary oem customer  nortel networks  has publicly announced that it is developing g based lte products 
we do not have an agreement to supply nortel networks with any g based products 
we believe that it is likely that nortel networks will choose to enter into partnerships for g based products with one or more of our competitors or choose to develop these products internally 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop and market new products compatible with g standards and the acceptance of those products by operators 
the development and introduction of these products will be time consuming and expensive  and we may not be able to correctly anticipate the market for g compatible products and related business trends 
any inability to develop successfully g based products could harm significantly our future business and operating results 

table of contents in  qualcomm indicated to us that we may owe royalties on ev do products that we sold beginning in if we are required to pay these royalties  our business and operating results would be harmed 
some of the technology that we incorporate into our ev do products and sell to nortel networks is licensed from qualcomm 
historically  we utilized this technology under license agreements between our company and qualcomm and between nortel networks and qualcomm 
some of the royalties for this technology were paid to qualcomm by nortel networks 
in march  qualcomm undertook an audit of the royalties that were paid in respect of the ev do products that we sold between and in connection with the audit  qualcomm indicated that  due to a change in its licensing arrangement with nortel networks  we may owe additional royalties of up to approximately million to qualcomm for products that we sold to nortel networks beginning in we believe that we should not be responsible for any such royalties to qualcomm because  among other things  we were delivering products to nortel networks under nortel networks license agreement with qualcomm and we had established a course of dealing with qualcomm in which nortel networks paid the royalties for such licensed technology and we had not been notified of the modifications to qualcomm s licensing arrangement with nortel networks 
as such  we have not provided for any potential liability in regard to this matter 
if we are required to pay royalties on either past or future sales of ev do products  such payments would adversely affect our operating results 
the variable sales and deployment cycles for our ev do products are likely to cause our quarterly billings to fluctuate materially 
the deployment by operators of wireless infrastructure equipment that enables new end user services typically occurs in stages  and our quarterly billings will vary significantly depending on the rate at which such deployments occur 
operators will typically make significant initial investments for new equipment to assure that new services facilitated by such equipment are available to end users throughout the operator s network 
operators typically will defer significant additional purchases of such equipment until end user usage of the services offered through such equipment creates demand for increased capacity 
our quarterly billings will typically increase significantly when an operator either chooses initially to deploy an ev do network or deploys a significant product upgrade introduced by us  and our quarterly billings will decline in other quarters when those deployments have been completed 
it is difficult to anticipate the rate at which operators will deploy our wireless infrastructure products  the rate at which the use of new mobile broadband services will create demand for additional capacity  and the rate at which operators will implement significant product upgrades 
for example  our product and service billings in fiscal reflected an increase in sales of software for oem base station channel cards that support rev a as operators ramped up their deployments of ev do infrastructure 
our product and service billings for each of the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal were less than our product and service billings for the first half of fiscal our product and service billings for the second half of fiscal were greater than they were for the first half of fiscal we believe that several large operators completed their initial deployments of rev a software in the first half of fiscal and then moderated their deployments over the remainder of the year 
we believe that several large operators began their capacity deployments in the second half of the staged deployments of wireless infrastructure equipment by customers of both our existing and new oems are likely to continue to cause significant volatility in our quarterly operating results 
if demand for mobile broadband services does not grow as quickly as we anticipate  or develops in a manner that we do not anticipate  our revenue and billings may decline or fail to grow  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  all of our revenue and billings from sales of mobile broadband infrastructure products 
we expect demand for mobile broadband services to be the primary driver for growth and expansion of ev do networks 
the market for mobile broadband services is relatively new and still evolving  and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
the level of demand and continued market acceptance for these services may be adversely affected by factors that limit or interrupt the supply of mobile phones designed for ev do networks 
for example  an order  currently under appeal  that was issued in by the united states international trade commission in a patent dispute between broadcom 
table of contents corporation and qualcomm  which bars importation into the united states of some qualcomm chips that are used in ev do mobile phones may have the effect of hampering demand for mobile broadband services 
in addition  the unavailability of ev do versions of popular mobile devices  such as the apple i phone that only work on umts technology  could hamper the expansion of ev do networks 
another expected driver for the growth of ev do networks is voip 
the migration of voice traffic to ev do networks will depend on many factors outside of our control 
if the demand for voip and other mobile broadband services does not grow  or grows more slowly than expected  the need for our ev do products would be diminished and our operating results would be significantly harmed 
deployments of our ev do products by two large us wireless operators account for a substantial majority of our revenue and billings  and a decision by these operators to reduce their use of our products would harm our business and operating results 
a substantial portion of our cumulative billings for fiscal  and are attributable to sales of our ev do products by nortel networks to two large wireless operators in north america 
our sales of ev do products currently depend to a significant extent on the rate at which these operators expand and upgrade their cdma networks 
our business and operating results would be harmed if either of these operators were to select a wireless network solution offered by a competitor or for any other reason were to discontinue or reduce the use of our products or product upgrades in their networks 
if the market for our fmc products does not develop as we expect  or our fmc products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance  our business will suffer 
we are investing significantly in the development of both our ev do based and umts based fmc products so that operators may offer mobile broadband services using wireline broadband connections and a combination of mobile and wi fi networks 
we do not expect to have meaningful sales of our fmc products until at least the second half of  depending on operators deployment plans 
however  it is possible that the market for our fmc products will not develop as we expect 
even if a market for our fmc products develops  it is uncertain whether our fmc products will achieve and sustain high levels of demand  market acceptance and profitability 
our ability to sell our fmc products will depend  in part  on factors outside our control  such as the commercial availability and market acceptance of mobile phones designed to support fmc applications and the market acceptance of femtocell access point products 
the market for our fmc products may be smaller than we expect  the market may develop more slowly than we expect or our competitors may develop alternative technologies that are more attractive to operators 
our fmc products are an important component of our growth and diversification strategy and  therefore  if we are unable to successfully execute on this strategy  our sales  billings and revenues could decrease and our operating results could be harmed 
our future sales will depend on our success in generating sales to a limited number of oem customers  and any failure to do so would have a significant detrimental effect on our business 
there are a limited number of oems that offer ev do solutions  several of which have developed their own ev do technology internally and  therefore  do not require solutions from us 
we currently have agreements with two oem customers 
we do not expect to commence significant sales to one of these oem customers in the immediate future because the markets for the products that we are developing for this customer are still developing 
the market for our fmc products is still developing 
we currently have three agreements with oem customers to deliver our umts femtocell product solutions and three agreements with oem customers to deliver our cdma femtocell product solutions  but have not yet had any significant sales to these customers 
our operating results for the foreseeable future will depend to a significant extent on our ability to effect sales to our existing cdma and umts oem customers and to establish new oem relationships 
our oem customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating pricing and other contractual terms with us 
in addition  further consolidation in the communications equipment market could adversely affect our oem customer relationships 
if we fail to generate significant product and service billings through our existing oem relationships or if we fail to establish significant new oem relationships  we will not be able to achieve our anticipated level of sales and our results of operations will suffer 

table of contents the unpredictability of our future results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our operating results have varied significantly from period to period  and we expect them to continue to vary significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future due to a number of factors in addition to the unpredictable purchasing patterns of operators 
the following factors  among others  can contribute to the unpredictability of our operating results the effect of our oem business model or changes to this model on our revenue recognition  the timing of agreements or commitments with our oem customers for new products or software upgrades  the timing of our delivery of software upgrades  the timing of our delivery of maintenance and support sold with products  the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us as they become due or in the case of nortel networks  when they would have become due  but for their filing for bankruptcy  the unpredictable deployment and purchasing patterns of operators  fluctuations in demand for products of our oem customers that are sold together with our products  and the timing and size of orders for such products of our oem customers  new product introductions and enhancements by our competitors and us  the timing and acceptance of software upgrades sold by our oem customers to their installed base of operators  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and deploy new products and product upgrades that meet customer requirements in a timely manner  adjustments in the reporting of royalties and product sales by our oem customers resulting from reviews and audits of such reports  our and our oem customers ability to obtain sufficient supplies of limited source components or materials  our and our oem customers ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  and general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the communications  networking  wireless and related industries 
our operating expenses are largely based on our anticipated organizational and product and service billings growth  especially as we continue to invest significant resources in the development of future products and expand our international presence 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation  are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  any shortfall in product and service billings in relation to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from period to period and could result in negative cash flow from operations 
we believe that comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future periods  our revenue  product and service billings  earnings  cash from operations or other operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock may decrease substantially 
we may not be able to achieve profitability for any period in the future or sustain cash flow from operating activities 
we began to recognize revenue in fiscal  began to have positive cash flow from operating activities in fiscal and achieved profitability in fiscal we have only a limited operating history on which you can base your evaluation of our business  including our ability to continue to grow our revenue and billings and to sustain cash flow from operating activities and profitability 
the amount and percentage of our operating expenses that are fixed expenses have increased as 
table of contents we have grown our business 
as we continue to expand and develop our business  we will need to generate significant billings to maintain positive cash flow from operating activities  and we might not sustain positive cash flow from operating activities for any substantial period of time 
we do not expect to achieve profitability for any fiscal year unless we are able to recognize significant revenue from our oem arrangements in that fiscal year 
if we are unable to increase our billings and sustain cash flow from operating activities  the market price of our common stock will likely fall 
on january   nortel networks announced that it and certain of its affiliates had filed for bankruptcy protection 
at the time of that filing  we had million of outstanding invoices to nortel networks and approximately million to million of unbilled amounts related to royalties earned through january  the collection of these amounts is subject to nortel networks bankruptcy proceedings and it is likely that a portion or all of these amounts will not be collected 
had nortel networks not filed for bankruptcy protection  these amounts would likely have been paid in due course in the first quarter of fiscal our cash flows for the first quarter of will be negatively impacted by million to million  representing the total billed and unbilled amounts due from nortel networks at the time of the filing 
claims by other parties that we infringe their proprietary technology could force us to redesign our products or to incur significant costs 
many companies in the wireless industry have significant patent portfolios 
these companies and other parties may claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights 
we may become involved in litigation as a result of allegations that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
any party asserting that our products infringe their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves  and possibly our customers  against the alleged infringement 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
we also could be forced to do one or more of the following stop selling  incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  redesign those products that use any allegedly infringing technology  which may be costly and time consuming  or refund deposits and other amounts received for allegedly infringing technology or products 
for example  in  we received a letter from wi lan inc asserting that some of our ev do products infringe two issued united states patents and an issued canadian patent relating to wireless communication technologies 
a majority of our revenue to date has been derived from the allegedly infringing ev do products 
we have evaluated various matters relating to wi lan s assertion and we do not believe that such products infringe any valid claim of the patents identified by wi lan in that letter 
in november  we received an additional letter from wi lan asserting that some of our other products infringe one of the previously identified united states patents and that the products identified in the first letter and some of our other products infringe two other united states patents 
we have evaluated wi lan s claims related to the products and patents identified in its november letter and we do not believe that our products infringe any valid claim of the patents identified by wi lan in that letter 
under certain circumstances we may seek to obtain a license to use the relevant technology from wi lan 
we cannot be certain that wi lan would provide such a license or  if provided  what its economic terms would be 
if we were to seek to obtain such a license  and such license were available from wi lan  we could be required to make significant payments with respect to past and or future sales of our products  and such payments may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
if wi lan determines to pursue claims against us for patent infringement  we might not be able to successfully defend against such claims 
intellectual property litigation can be costly 
even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could deplete our financial resources 
litigation is also time consuming and could divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
furthermore  during the course of litigation  confidential information may be disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests  depositions or trial testimony 
disclosure of our confidential information and our involvement in intellectual property litigation could materially adversely affect our business 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property 
table of contents litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources 
in addition  any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could significantly limit our ability to continue our operations 
if we are not successful in obtaining from third parties licenses to intellectual property that are required for gsm umts products that we are developing  we may not be able to expand our business as expected and our business may suffer 
the gsm umts markets are characterized by the presence of many patents held by third parties 
we will need to obtain licenses from third parties for intellectual property associated with our development of gsm umts products 
any required license might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we succeed in obtaining these licenses  but the payments under these licenses are higher than we anticipate  our costs for these products would increase and our operating results would suffer 
if we failed to obtain a required license  our ability to develop gsm umts products would be impaired  we may not be able to expand our business as expected and our business may suffer 
if we do not timely deliver new and enhanced products that respond to customer requirements and technological changes  operators may not buy our products and our revenue and product and service billings may decline significantly 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
to achieve market acceptance for our products  we must effectively anticipate operator requirements  and we must offer products that meet changing operator demands in a timely manner 
operators may require product features and capabilities that our current products do not have 
if we fail to develop products that satisfy operator requirements  our ability to create or increase demand for our products will be harmed 
in developing our wireless infrastructure products  we seek to identify the long term trends of wireless operators and their customers 
the development cycle for our products and technologies can take multiple years 
the ultimate success of our new products depends  in large part  on the accuracy of our assessments of the long term needs of the industry  and it is difficult to change quickly the design or function of a planned new product if the market need does not develop as we anticipate 
we may experience difficulties with software development  industry standards  hardware design  manufacturing or marketing that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or implementation of new products and enhancements 
the introduction of new products by competitors  including some of our oem customers  the emergence of new industry standards or the development of entirely new technologies that replace existing product offerings could render our existing or future products obsolete 
if our products become technologically obsolete  operators may purchase solutions offered by our competitors and our ability to generate revenue and product and service billings may be impaired 
our revenue and product and service billings growth will be limited if our oem customers are unable to continue to sell our products to large wireless operators or if we have to discount our products to support the selling efforts of our oem customers 
our future success depends in part on the ability of our oem customers to sell our products to large wireless operators operating complex networks that serve large numbers of subscribers and transport high volumes of traffic 
our oem customers operate in a highly competitive environment and may need to reduce the prices they charge for our products in order to maintain or expand their market share 
we may reduce the prices we charge our oem customers for our products in order to support their selling efforts 
if our oem customers incur shortfalls in their sales of mobile broadband solutions to their existing customers or fail to expand their customer base to include additional operators that deploy our products in large scale networks serving significant numbers of subscribers or if we reduce the prices we charge our oem customers for our products  our operating results will suffer 

table of contents we depend on sole sources for certain components of our products and our business would be harmed if the supply from our sole sources were disrupted 
we depend on sole sources for certain components of our products and also rely on contract manufacturers for the production of our hardware products 
we have not entered into long term agreements with any of our suppliers 
we depend on several software vendors for the operating system and other capabilities used in our products 
in addition  we and one of our oem customers purchase from qualcomm the cell site modem chips used in any base station and base station channel cards 
if these cell site modem chips were to become unavailable to us or to our oem customers  it would take us a significant period of time to develop alternative solutions and it is likely that our operating results would be significantly harmed 
the market for network infrastructure products is highly competitive and continually evolving  and if we are not able to compete effectively  we may not be able to continue to expand our business as expected and our business may suffer 
the market for network infrastructure products is highly competitive and rapidly evolving 
the market is subject to changing technology trends  shifting customer needs and expectations and frequent introduction of new products 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future as the market for network infrastructure products grows and new and existing competitors devote considerable resources to introducing and enhancing products 
for our ev do products  we face competition from several of the world s largest telecommunications equipment providers that provide either a directly competitive product or a product based on alternative technologies  including alcatel lucent  hitachi  huawei  lg nortel and samsung 
in our sales to oem customers  we face the competitive risk that oems might seek to develop internally alternative solutions to those currently purchased from us 
additionally  our oem customers might elect to purchase technology from our competitors 
for our fmc products  our competition includes several public companies  including cisco and ericsson  as well as several private companies such as huawei 
our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  many of our competitors have more extensive customer relationships than we do  and  therefore  our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to market or sell their products more effectively 
moreover  further consolidation in the communications equipment market could adversely affect our oem customer relationships and competitive position 
our products may not continue to compete favorably 
we may not be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering the markets in which we provide products 
as a result  we may experience price reductions for our products  order cancellations and increased expenses 
accordingly  our business may not grow as expected and our business may suffer 
our agreement with our largest oem customer  nortel networks  provides nortel networks with an option to license some of our intellectual property to develop internally products competitive with the products it currently purchases from us 
under our oem agreement with nortel networks  nortel networks has the option to purchase from us the specification for communications among base stations  radio network controllers and network management systems 
the specification would enable nortel networks to develop ev do software to work with the base station channel card software licensed from us and deployed in the networks of its wireless operator customers 
if nortel networks elects to exercise this option  nortel networks will pay us a fixed fee as well as a significant royalty on sales of current and future products that incorporate this specification 
the royalty rate varies with annual volume but represents a portion of the license fees we currently receive from our sales to nortel networks 
if nortel networks were to exercise the option  nortel networks would receive the current interface specification at the time of option exercise  updated with an upgrade then under development  plus one additional upgrade subject to a development agreement within a limited time after the option exercise for an additional fee 
if nortel networks 
table of contents were in the future to develop its own ev do software  it could  by exercising this option  enable its own software to communicate with the base station channel cards currently installed in its customers networks 
adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial and credit markets could negatively affect our customers  and therefore our performance 
a prolonged economic downturn in the business or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a decline in our revenue and billings 
volatility and disruption of financial and credit markets could limit customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and invest in network infrastructure and therefore also could reduce demand for our products and result in a decline in our revenues and billings 
in addition  during economic downturns  customers may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors or become unable to pay their debts as they become due 
if any of our significant customers do not pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner or becomes unable to pay such amounts to us at a time when we have substantial amounts receivable from such customers  our cash flow and results of operations may suffer 
at the time they filed for bankruptcy protection  nortel networks had outstanding invoices to us of million and approximately million to million of unbilled amounts which are now subject to the bankruptcy process 
we will not be able to collect on these invoices when they otherwise would have been due  and we may be unable to collect them in full  or at all 
additionally  disruptions of the credit markets and any limitations on the availability of credit to our customers could impact their ability to invest in network infrastructure and purchase our products 
because our business depends on the continued strength of the communications industry  our operating results will suffer if that industry experiences an economic downturn 
we derive most of our revenue and billings from purchases of our products by customers in the communications industry 
our future success depends upon the continued demand from wireless operators for communications equipment 
the communications industry is cyclical and reactive to general economic conditions 
in the recent past  worldwide economic downturns  pricing pressures  mergers and deregulation have led to consolidations and reorganizations 
these downturns  pricing pressures and restructurings have caused delays and reductions in capital and operating expenditures by many wireless operators 
these delays and reductions  in turn  have reduced demand for communications products such as ours 
a continuation or recurrence of these industry patterns  as well as general domestic and foreign economic conditions and other factors that reduce spending by companies in the communications industry  could harm our operating results in the future 
the success of our business could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately 
our success depends to a degree upon the protection of our software  hardware designs and other proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees  contract manufacturers  consultants  customers and other third parties to protect our intellectual property rights 
other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us  and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties 
in addition  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
for example  if a competitor were to gain use of certain of our proprietary technology  it might be able to develop and manufacture similarly designed and equipped mobile broadband solutions at a reduced cost  which could result in a decrease in demand for our products 
furthermore  we have adopted a strategy of seeking limited patent protection both in the united states and in foreign countries with respect to the technologies used in or relating to our products 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims  and even if patents are issued  they may be contested  
table of contents circumvented or invalidated over the course of our business 
moreover  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages  and  as with any technology  competitors may be able to develop and obtain patents for technologies that are similar to or superior to our technologies 
if that happens  we may need to license these technologies and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  if at all  thereby causing great harm to our business 
in addition  if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could become burdensome and expensive  even if we were to prevail 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business  cause dilution to our stockholders and harm our financial condition and operating results 
we intend to pursue acquisitions of companies or assets in order to enhance our market position or expand our product portfolio 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  if at all 
if we do complete acquisitions  we cannot be sure that they will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or that they will not be viewed negatively by customers  securities analysts or investors 
in addition  any acquisitions that we make could lead to difficulties in integrating personnel and operations from the acquired businesses and in retaining and motivating key personnel from those businesses 
acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day responsibilities  increase our expenses and harm our operating results or financial condition 
future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or the application of new standards could adversely affect our operating results 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  the sec and various other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and they could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  we recognize substantially all of our revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop no 
the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant accounting standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in software licensing arrangements and arrangements for the sale of hardware products that contain more than an insignificant amount of software 
we collaborate with our oem customers to develop and negotiate pricing for specific features for future product releases and specified software upgrades 
because we do not sell the same products and upgrades to more than one customer  we are unable to establish fair value for these products and upgrades 
as a result  under sop no 
 we are required to defer most of our revenue from sales to our oem customers until after we ship specified upgrades that were committed to the oem customer at the time of sale 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards  including sop no 
 or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue recognition accounting policies that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in august  the sec decided to seek public comments on the potential mandatory adoption of international financial reporting standards  or ifrs  by all us issuers 
the proposed roadmap targets potential mandatory adoption of ifrs in the us beginning in  but lays out several milestones that would need to be achieved prior to the sec mandating use of ifrs for all us issuers 
the proposed rule would allow certain qualifying domestic issuers to use ifrs as early as fiscal years ending on or after december  should we be required to adopt ifrs  our operating results for past  current  or future periods may be adversely affected 
we have not yet assessed the impact of potentially applying ifrs 
in december  the fasb and the international accounting standards board issued a discussion paper which detailed their preliminary views on a single  assets and liabilities based revenue recognition model that they believe will improve financial reporting 
if and when a new revenue recognition model is finalized  it may change 
table of contents the way in which we recognize and record revenue and could adversely affect our operating results in current or future periods 
we have not yet assessed the impact of this preliminary revenue recognition model 
the loss of key personnel or an inability to attract and retain additional personnel may impair our ability to grow our business 
we are highly dependent upon the continued service and performance of our senior management team and key technical and sales personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  chief technical officer  and vice president  femto business and corporate development 
none of these officers is a party to an employment agreement with us  and any of them therefore may terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice 
the replacement of these officers likely would involve significant time and costs  and the loss of these officers may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous technology  software and manufacturing companies 
for example  our competitors may be able to attract and retain a more qualified engineering team by offering more competitive compensation packages 
if we are unable to attract new engineers and retain our current engineers  we may not be able to develop and service our products at the same levels as our competitors and we may  therefore  lose potential customers and sales penetration in certain markets 
our failure to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan and  as a result  our ability to compete effectively in the mobile broadband solutions market could decrease  our operating results could suffer and our revenues could decrease 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company as compared with our history as a private company  and our management is required to devote substantial time to public company compliance initiatives 
if we are unable to absorb these increased costs or maintain management focus on development and sales of our product offerings and services  we may not be able to achieve our business plan 
as a public company  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq stock market  have imposed a variety of requirements on public companies  including requiring changes in corporate governance practices 
our management and other personnel have and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly 
for example  we believe these new rules and regulations have made it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
we are exposed to potential risks and will continue to incur significant costs as a result of the internal control testing and evaluation process mandated by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and assessed all deficiencies on both an individual basis and in combination to determine if  when aggregated  they constitute a material weakness 
as a result of this evaluation  no material weaknesses were identified 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs  including increased accounting fees and increased staffing levels  in order to maintain compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we continue to monitor our controls for any weaknesses or deficiencies 
no evaluation can provide complete assurance that our internal controls will detect or uncover all failures of persons within our company to disclose material information otherwise required to be reported 
the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could also be limited by simple errors or faulty judgments 
in addition  as we continue to expand globally  the challenges involved in implementing appropriate internal controls will increase and will require that we continue to improve our internal controls over financial reporting 
in the future  if we fail to complete our sarbanes oxley evaluation in a timely manner  or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot attest in a timely manner to our evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls which could adversely impact 
table of contents the market price of our common stock 
we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting which may result in a loss of public confidence in our internal controls and adversely impact the market price of our common stock 
in addition  any failure to implement required  new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we are unable to manage our growth and expand our operations successfully  our business and operating results will be harmed and our reputation may be damaged 
we anticipate that further expansion of our infrastructure and headcount may be required to achieve planned expansion of our product offerings and planned increases in our customer base 
our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to refine our operational  financial and management controls  human resource policies  and reporting systems and procedures 
we may not be able to implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
if we are unable to manage future expansion  our ability to provide high quality products and services could be harmed  which would damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us  and if it is available  may dilute our existing stockholders ownership of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund ongoing operations  take advantage of opportunities  including more rapid expansion of our business or the acquisition of complementary products  technologies or businesses  develop new products  or respond to competitive pressures 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership of our common stock 
capital raised through debt financing would require us to make periodic interest payments and may impose potentially restrictive covenants on the conduct of our business 
furthermore  additional financings may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in the current economic environment 
a failure to obtain additional funding could prevent us from making expenditures that may be required to grow or maintain our operations 
our ability to sell our products depends in part on the quality of our support and services offerings  and our failure to offer high quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
once our products are deployed within an operator s network  the operator and our oem customer depend on our support organization to resolve issues relating to our products 
a high level of support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products 
if we do not effectively assist operators in deploying our products  succeed in helping operators quickly resolve post deployment issues  and provide effective ongoing support it would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
as a result  our failure to maintain high quality support and services would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our products are highly technical and may contain undetected software or hardware errors  which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business 
our products are highly technical and complex and are critical to the operation of many networks 
our products have contained and are expected to continue to contain one or more undetected errors  defects or security vulnerabilities 
some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by 
table of contents an operator 
for example  we have encountered errors in our software products that have caused operators using our products to experience a temporary loss of certain network services 
any errors  defects or security vulnerabilities discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition  loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost  any of which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we could face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty  including claims related to changes to our products made by our oem customers 
our contracts for the sale of our products contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations  which in certain cases may not be upheld 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  is costly and may divert management s attention and adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products 
in addition  if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  our financial condition could be harmed 
our international operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we have sales personnel in seven countries worldwide  nearly engineers and support staff in bangalore  india and approximately engineers and support staff in cambridge  united kingdom 
we expect to continue to add personnel in foreign countries  especially at our bangalore  india and cambridge  united kingdom facilities 
our international operations subject us to a variety of risks  including the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices and the increased travel  infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations  difficulties in enforcing contracts  collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles  especially in emerging markets  the need to localize our products and licensing programs for international customers  tariffs and trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets  increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
our foreign operations incur expenses in local currencies 
because we incur a substantial portion of our operating expenses in india and the united kingdom  we are subject to currency exchange risks between the us dollar on the one hand  and the indian rupee and british pound  on the other 
we may derive some of our future revenue from customers in foreign countries that pay for our products in the form of their local currency  which also would subject us to currency exchange risks 
our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales  adversely affecting our business  operating results and financial condition 
if wireless devices pose safety risks  we may be subject to new regulations  and demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers may decrease 
concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions  even if unfounded  may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless devices  which would decrease demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers 
in recent years  the fcc and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment  including wireless phones and other wireless devices 
in addition  interest groups have requested that the fcc investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags  hearing aids and other medical devices 
concerns have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated with the use of wireless devices while driving 
any legislation that may be adopted in response to these expressions of concern could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers in the united states as well as foreign countries 

table of contents risks relating to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
our common stock has a limited trading history 
the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile 
some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include fluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us  fluctuations in our revenue as a result of our revenue recognition policy  even during periods of significant sales activity  changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts  failure of any of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any adverse change in our relationship with nortel networks  including as a result of nortel networks bankruptcy filing  changes in market valuations of similar companies  success of competitive products  changes in our capital structure  such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt  announcements by us or our competitors of significant products  contracts  acquisitions or strategic alliances  regulatory developments in the united states  foreign countries or both  litigation involving our company  our general industry or both  additions or departures of key personnel  general perception of the future of cdma technology  investors general perception of us  and changes in general economic  industry and market conditions 
in addition  if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence  the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if any of the foregoing occurs  it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that  even if unsuccessful  could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 
if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock  the price of our common stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business 
we do not control these analysts 
the price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 
a significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the public market in the near future  which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
if our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

table of contents the holders of a majority of our common stock have rights  subject to some conditions  to require us to file registration statements under the securities act or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file in the future for ourselves or other stockholders 
if we register their shares of common stock  they could sell those shares in the public market 
our directors and management will exercise significant control over our company 
our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will be able to influence our management and affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws or delaware law might discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and  therefore  depress the trading price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our by laws or delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock 
these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management 
these provisions include limitations on the removal of directors  a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings  the ability of our board of directors to make  alter or repeal our by laws  and the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to institute a rights plan  or a poison pill  that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer  likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder  generally a person which together with its affiliates owns  or within the last three years has owned  of our voting stock  for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the existence of the foregoing provisions and anti takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
they could also deter potential acquirers of our company  thereby reducing the likelihood that stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and  consequently  the ability to achieve a return on an investment in our common stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock 
although we paid a special cash dividend on our capital stock in april  we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to invest our future earnings  if any  to fund our growth 
therefore  stockholders are not likely to receive any dividends on shares of common stock for the foreseeable future

overview we are a leading provider of network infrastructure products used by wireless operators to provide mobile broadband services 
we specialize in helping operators transform the mobile experience of users worldwide 
our high performance technology and products  from comprehensive femtocell solutions to core mobile network infrastructure  enable operators to deliver broadband services to mobile subscribers  wherever they are 
most of our current products are based on a wireless communications standard known as cdma xev do  or ev do 
in  we began delivering commercial infrastructure products based on the first generation ev do standard known as rev the second generation ev do standard is known as rev a  and supports push to talk  voip and faster internet services 
we delivered our first rev a software release in april prior to  most of our ev do sales were driven by operator deployments focused on coverage with operators extending their broadband services across larger portions of their subscriber geographies 
operators in some markets continue to deploy our products to expand coverage 
data traffic and service revenue growth continues to outpace voice growth at many major wireless operators around the world 
our ev do sales in were driven by capacity growth as operators looked to expand their capacity to accommodate increased data traffic fueled by greater consumer use of handheld devices  web browsing and g multimedia applications 
over the longer term  we expect our ev do sales to continue to be driven by capacity growth as operators acquire more broadband subscribers that consume more broadband data 
we have developed a special business model to serve mobile operators and our oem customers with embedded software products 
our software is deployed in an oem s installed base of wireless networks 
these networks are designed to deliver high quality wireless services to millions of consumers and are built and regularly upgraded over long periods of time  often to years 
a key element of our strategy is to deliver significant increases in performance and functionality to both our oem customers and to operators through software upgrades to these networks 
in  we delivered two major ev do software releases that provide for deployment of high performance multi media applications by enabling faster downlink and uplink speeds  supporting push to talk services  and adding new proprietary clustering features that are designed to dramatically improve network scalability 
in we delivered two additional ev do software releases which enable mobile operators to more efficiently increase capacity and accelerate the roll out of next generation multimedia services 

table of contents we are also investing significantly in fixed mobile convergence products that transform the experience of using mobile devices indoors  providing benefits such as better coverage  better quality and performance of broadband applications  and lower costs for both users and operators 
our fmc products enable operators to take advantage of wireline broadband connections such as cable  dsl and fiber that already exist in most offices and homes to connect mobile devices to an operator s services 
there are two ways to accomplish this 
the first is to use wi fi and the second is to place a personal base station  or what the industry refers to as a femtocell access point in the home or office 
to address both of these market opportunities  we have developed our universal access gateway  or uag  product to manage security and hand offs when connecting a wi fi phone or a femtocell product to an operator s network 
currently  there is significant operator interest in our fmc products  especially our femtocells  as they work with existing handsets 
our fmc products include versions to support cdma and umts networks 
our fmc products are an important component of our growth and diversification strategy 
users also utilize our mobile broadband technology and products to create private mobile networks 
we were founded in march and sold our first product in the second quarter of fiscal our growth has been driven primarily by sales through our oem customers to wireless operators already using our ev do products as they increase the capacity and geographic coverage of their networks  and by an increase in the number of wireless operators that decide to deploy our ev do products on their networks 
we have sold nearly  channel card licenses for use by over operators worldwide 
in april  we acquired way networks  a united kingdom based provider of femtocell products and solutions for umts networks  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash and  shares of common stock 
the acquisition furthered our strategy to address the umts market and to deliver fmc and in building mobile broadband solutions 
in july  we completed our ipo  in which we sold and issued million shares of our common stock at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from our ipo  or million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of approximately million 
in august  we entered into an agreement with nokia siemens networks to certify interoperability of our umts femtocell product with nokia siemens networks femto gateway product 
we and nokia siemens networks plan to provide a joint solution to operators  and cooperate in joint marketing  sales and support programs 
the agreement is non exclusive and sets forth the terms under which we may use their proprietary interface specifications of their products 
in september  we entered into an agreement with nortel networks amending certain provisions of the development and purchase and sale agreement for cdma high data rate xev do products  dated as of october   between us and nortel networks  in which we agreed to pricing for our products and services  including pricing for software products and upgrades that were under development at the time and were subsequently delivered in june our agreement with nortel networks is subject to rejection and discharge in nortel networks bankruptcy 
although we intend to work with nortel networks to have our agreement assumed  there can be no assurance that nortel networks will assume its agreement with us 
in january  we entered into a global sourcing agreement with thomson to supply our umts femtocell technology 
pursuant to the agreement  thomson may use our femtocell products in conjunction with its own residential gateway offerings 
the agreement is non exclusive and sets forth the terms and conditions under which thomson may purchase our femtocell products 
the term of the agreement extends through january  with automatic annual renewals 
either party may terminate the agreement with days notice 
in february  we entered into a global oem agreement with motorola to provide our cdma femtocell solution products 
the agreement is non exclusive and sets forth the terms and conditions under which motorola may purchase our femtocell and uag products 
the initial term of the agreement extends through may  with automatic annual renewals 
following the initial term  motorola may terminate the agreement with days notice 

table of contents in june  we entered into an agreement with alcatel lucent to develop an integrated ip multimedia subsystem  or ims femtocell solution for cdma network operators that combines airvana s femtocell access point and femtocell network gateway with alcatel lucent s ims core network infrastructure 
in july  we entered into an agreement with hitachi to develop a joint cdma femtocell solution that integrates our femtocell products with hitachi s core radio access network infrastructure that hitachi offers in japan 
in september  we entered into a supply agreement with hitachi under which hitachi will provide marketing  sales and support activities for our femtocell products 
the initial term of the supply agreement extends through june and provides for automatic annual renewals  unless either party gives days notice of its intent not to renew 
in november  we entered into another agreement with nortel networks amending certain provisions of the development and purchase and sale agreement for cdma high data rate xev do products  dated as of october   between us and nortel networks  in which we agreed to pricing for software products and upgrades that were under development at the time 
our agreement with nortel networks is subject to rejection and discharge in nortel networks bankruptcy 
although we intend to work with nortel networks to have our agreement assumed  there can be no assurance that nortel networks will assume its agreement with us 
in december  we entered into a sourcing agreement with pirelli broadband solutions to add wireless broadband connectivity to pirelli s portfolio of consumer broadband devices by using our umts femtocell technology 
the agreement is non exclusive and sets forth the terms and conditions under which pirelli may purchase our femtocell products 
the initial term of the agreement extends through november  with automatic annual renewals  unless either party gives days notice of its intent not to renew 
our oem business model we operate in the highly consolidated and competitive market for mobile broadband equipment 
to compete in this market  we have developed oem channels  unique products and a business approach that targets the needs of large equipment vendors and their end customers  wireless operators 
wireless operators invest significantly in building out large scale wireless networks  which are very costly to replace 
equipment vendors compete aggressively to win market share and they retain their market position by upgrading their installed systems regularly  thereby enabling their wireless operator customers to deliver new services to their subscribers 
these vendors develop detailed product roadmaps and look to us to design and deliver software upgrades that are consistent with their roadmaps 
we collaborate with our oem customers to develop specific features for products that they sell to their wireless operator customers 
we expect to continue to develop  for each oem customer  products based on our core technology that are configured specifically to meet the requirements of each oem and its customers 
we also offer our oem customers the option to purchase and make available to their wireless operator customers new products and specified upgrades at prices that we set typically several months prior to the new product or specified upgrade release 
we expect that we will release one or more specified upgrades per year 
our oem customers typically are also potential competitors of ours in the markets that they serve 
we face the competitive risk that our oem customers might seek to develop internally alternative solutions or to purchase alternative products from our competitors 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop products that offer advantages over alternative solutions that our oem customers might develop or purchase from others 
our typical sales arrangements involve multiple elements  including perpetual licenses for our software products and specified software upgrades  the sale of hardware  maintenance and support services  and the sale of professional services  including training 
software is more than incidental to all of our products and  as a result  we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition 
impact of sop no 
 software revenue recognition to recognize revenue from current product shipments  we must establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for all undelivered elements of our sales arrangements  including our specified software upgrades 
the best objective evidence of fair value would be to sell these specified software upgrades separately to 
table of contents multiple customers for the same price 
however  because of our oem business model  the features and functionality delivered in our software upgrades are defined in collaboration with our oems based on each oem s particular requirements 
as a result  it is highly unlikely that we will ever be able to sell the same standalone software upgrade to a different oem customer and thus establish vsoe of fair value for such upgrade 
as a result  we defer all revenue from sales to oems until all elements without vsoe of fair value have been delivered 
this deferral is required because there is no basis to allocate revenue between the delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement without vsoe of fair value 
the revenue deferral is necessary even though our specified software upgrades are not essential to the standalone functionality of any product currently deployed  the purchase of our upgrades are based on separate decisions by our oem customers and generally require separate payment at the time of delivery and there is no refund liability for payments received on any previously shipped and installed product in the event we are not able to deliver the specified upgrade 
we recognize deferred revenue from sales to an oem customer only when we deliver a specified upgrade that we have previously committed 
when we commit to an additional upgrade before we have delivered a previously committed upgrade  we defer all revenue from product sales after the date of such commitment until we deliver the additional upgrade 
any revenue that we had deferred prior to the additional commitment is recognized when the previously committed upgrade is delivered 
we anticipate that the revenue recognition related to the our fixed mobile convergence products will be complex given that a number of our current arrangements for the development and supply of these products contain significant customization services  volume discounts  specified upgrades and multiple elements for new service offerings for which vsoe of fair value does not currently exist 
to date  there have been no material revenues recognized with respect to these products 

table of contents the following diagram presents a hypothetical example of how software product releases and commitments to specified upgrades affect the relationship between product billings  product revenue and deferred product revenue under a business model similar to our current ev do oem business model 
the diagram does not reflect the actual timing of any of our software releases  the actual level of our product and service billings  revenue or deferred revenue in any period  the actual timing of recognition of our product and service revenues  or the deferral of product revenue that can result from the inability to establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support services 
flow chart software release a is delivered and related product and service billings are recognized as revenue because there are no outstanding commitments for upgrades 
software upgrade b is committed in period and  therefore  product and service billings for shipments of software release a after that point cannot be recognized as revenue before software upgrade b is delivered 
before software upgrade b is delivered  software upgrade c is committed in period and  therefore  product and service billings for shipments of software release a after that point cannot be recognized before software upgrade c is delivered 
when software upgrade b is delivered in period  all deferred revenue  which consists of deferred revenue from billings of software release a  from the time of the commitment of software upgrade b until the time of the commitment of software upgrade c is recognized  subject to being able to establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support services 
when software upgrade c is delivered in period  all remaining deferred revenue from the time of the commitment of software upgrade c  which consists of deferred revenue from billings of software release a and 
table of contents software upgrade b  is recognized because no commitments are outstanding  subject to being able to establish vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support services 
as illustrated in this example  we begin to recognize our revenue in periods during which we deliver specified upgrades 
when we have such revenue recognition events  we begin to recognize revenue from sales invoiced during multiple prior periods 
as a result  we believe that our revenue  taken in isolation  provides limited insight into the performance of our business 
we evaluate our performance by also assessing product and service billings  which reflects our sales activity in a period  cost related to product and service billings  which reflects the cost associated with our product and service billings  deferred revenue at the end of the period  which reflects the cumulative billings that we were unable to recognize under our revenue recognition policy  deferred product cost at the end of a period  which reflects the cumulative costs that we were unable to recognize under our revenue recognition policy associated with our deferred product revenue  and cash flow from operating activities 
we expect this pattern of commitments and delivery of future specified upgrades and the resulting impact on the timing of revenue recognition to continue with respect to our oem business 
as we introduce new products  the variability of the total revenue recognized in any fiscal period may moderate  provided that we are able to establish vsoe of fair value for these new products or upgrades to these new products  and as sales of these new products represent a larger percentage of our overall business 
key elements of financial performance revenue our revenue consists of product revenue and service revenue from sales through our oem customers and directly to our end customers 
product revenue 
our product revenue is principally currently derived from the sale of our ev do mobile network products that are used by wireless operators to provide mobile broadband services 
these products include four major components base stations or oem base station channel cards  radio network controllers  network management systems  and software upgrades to the oem s installed base 
we have sold oem base station channel cards both as hardware software combinations and as software licenses when the oem customer chooses to have the hardware manufactured for it by a third party 
rncs and network management systems are usually sold as software licenses as the oem customer procures off the shelf hardware from third party suppliers 
almost all of our revenue and product and service billings to date have been derived from sales of our ev do products through our oem agreement with nortel networks 
revenue from our fmc products have not been material to date 
we first derived revenue and product and service billings in fiscal from the sale of first generation ev do mobile network products based on the rev version of the standard 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal  we sold rev based base station channel cards  which were manufactured for us by a third party  and licensed rev software for these oem base station channel cards  as well as for rncs and network management systems 
in connection with the transition to products based on the rev a version of the standard  nortel networks exercised its right to license our hardware design in order to manufacture the oem base station channel cards that support rev a instead of purchasing this hardware from us 
as a result  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  our product sales to nortel networks are derived solely from the license of software  specifically rev and rev a software  rncs and network management systems  as well as rev a software for oem base station channel cards and system upgrades 
under our revenue recognition policy  as described above  we begin to recognize revenue from sales to an oem customer only after we deliver a specified upgrade that we have previously committed 
when we commit to an additional upgrade before we have delivered a previously committed upgrade  we defer all revenue from product sales after the date of such commitment until we deliver the additional upgrade 
our product revenue in fiscal consisted primarily of software license fees and hardware shipments to our primary oem customer from fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal  which is when we made an additional commitment for a specified future software upgrade 
we refer to that software upgrade as our april specified upgrade or software version in the first quarter of fiscal  we delivered software version as a result  we recognized product revenue of million that consisted primarily of software license fees and hardware shipments to our primary oem customer from april through september  which is when we 
table of contents made another commitment for a specified future software upgrade 
we refer to that software upgrade as our september specified upgrade or software version in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we delivered software version as a result  we recognized product revenue of million that consisted primarily of software license fees and hardware shipments to our primary oem customer from september through june  which is when we made another commitment for a specified future software upgrade 
we refer to that software upgrade as the june specified upgrade or software version in the second quarter of fiscal  we delivered software version as a result  we recognized product revenue of million that consisted primarily of billings from software license fees to our primary oem customer from june through december  when we made another commitment for a specified future software upgrade 
we refer to that software upgrade as the december specified upgrade or software version in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we delivered software version as a result  we recognized product revenue of million that consisted primarily of billings from software license fees to our primary oem customer from december through july  when we made another commitment for a specified future software upgrade 
we refer to that software upgrade as the july specified upgrade or software version in october  we made another commitment for a specified software upgrade  which we refer to as the october specified upgrade or software version as of december   there were two specified software upgrades that we had not yet delivered  software version  which we expect to deliver in the second quarter of fiscal and software version  which we expect to deliver in the second half of fiscal service revenue 
our service revenue is derived from support and maintenance services  which we refer to as post contract customer support or pcs  for our ev do products and other professional services  including training 
our support and maintenance services consist of the repair or replacement of defective hardware  around the clock help desk support  technical support and the correction of bugs in our software 
our annual support and maintenance fees are based on a fixed dollar amount associated with  or a percentage of the initial sales price for  the applicable hardware and software products 
included in the price for the product  we provide maintenance and support during our product warranty period  which is two years for our base station channel cards and one year for our software products 
as discussed above  we defer all revenue  including revenue related to maintenance and support services  until all specified upgrades outstanding at the time of shipment have been delivered 
when vsoe of fair value for pcs does not exist  all revenue related to product sales and software only license fees  including bundled pcs  is deferred until all specified software upgrades outstanding at the time of shipment are delivered 
at the time of the delivery of all such upgrades  we recognize a proportionate amount of all such revenue previously deferred based on the portion of the applicable warranty period that has elapsed at the time of such delivery 
the unearned revenue is recognized ratably over the remainder of the applicable warranty period 
when vsoe of fair value for pcs exists  we allocate a portion of the initial product revenue and software only license fees to the bundled pcs based on the fees we charge for annual pcs when sold separately 
when all specified software upgrades outstanding at the time of shipment are delivered  under the residual method  we recognize the previously deferred product revenue and software only license fees  as well as the earned pcs revenue  based on the portion of the applicable warranty period that has elapsed 
the unearned pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the remainder the applicable warranty period 
notwithstanding our inability to establish vsoe of fair value of maintenance and support services to nortel networks under sop no 
for revenue recognition purposes  we are permitted to present product revenue and service revenue separately on our consolidated statements of operations based on historical maintenance and support services renewal rates at the time of sale 
our support and maintenance arrangements for our ev do products are typically renewable for one year periods 
we invoice our support and maintenance fees in advance of the applicable maintenance period  and we recognize revenue from maintenance and support services ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance and support period as services are delivered 
we also offer professional services such as deployment optimization  network engineering and radio frequency deployment planning  and provide training for network planners and engineers 
we generally recognize revenue for these services as the services are performed 

table of contents product and service billings product and service billings  which is a non gaap measure  represents the amount invoiced for products and services that are delivered and services that are to be delivered to our end customers directly or through our oem channels for which we expect payment will be made in accordance with normal payment terms 
software only product sales under our oem agreements are invoiced monthly upon notification of sale by the oem customer 
we present the product and service billings metric because we believe it provides a consistent basis for understanding our sales activity and our oem channel sales from period to period 
we use product and service billings as a measure to assess our business performance and as a key factor in our incentive compensation program 
wireless operators generally purchase communications equipment in stages driven first by coverage and later by capacity 
the initial stage involves deploying new services in selected parts of their networks  often those geographic regions with the highest concentration of customers 
wireless operators then typically expand coverage throughout their network 
later purchases are driven by a desire to expand capacity as the usage of new services grows 
initial purchases usually occur around the time that we and our oem customers offer products that substantially improve the performance of the network 
subsequent purchases to expand the geographic coverage and capacity of an operator s wireless network are difficult to predict because they are typically related to consumer demand for mobile broadband services 
as a result  our product and service billings have fluctuated significantly from period to period and we expect them to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period for the foreseeable future 
on january   nortel networks announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection 
at the time of that filing  we had outstanding invoices to nortel networks in the amount of million and approximately million to million of unbilled amounts related to royalties earned through january  the collection of these amounts is subject to nortel networks bankruptcy proceedings 
as a result  we excluded the million of pre bankruptcy filing outstanding invoices to nortel networks from billings for the quarter and year ended december  billed and unbilled receivables as of the date of the nortel networks filing will be accounted for on a cash basis as collected 
our product and service billings were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal product and service billings to nortel networks were of billings in fiscal  of billings in fiscal and of billings in fiscal 
the following table reconciles revenue to product and service billings fiscal year revenue deferred revenue  at end of period less deferred revenue acquired less deferred revenue  at beginning of period product and service billings deferred revenue product and service billings for invoiced shipments and software license fees  and related maintenance services  as well as non recurring engineering and other development services for which revenue is not recognized in the current period are recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue increases each fiscal period by the amount of product and service billings that are deferred in the period and decreases by the amount of revenue recognized in the period 
we classify deferred revenue that we expect to recognize during the next twelve months as current deferred revenue on our balance sheet and the remainder as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   million of deferred revenue is included in current liabilities and million of deferred revenue is included in long term liabilities 

table of contents cost of revenue cost of product revenue consists primarily of cost for channel card hardware provided by contract manufacturers  cost of hardware for our rncs and network management systems  license fees for third party software and other intellectual property used in our products  and other related overhead costs 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for employees that provide support services to customers and manage the supply chain 
in  qualcomm indicated to us that we may owe them royalties of up to approximately million for ev do products that we sold to nortel networks beginning in see note to the financial statements contained in part ii  item below  related party transactions 
although we believe we are not obligated to pay these royalties  if we are required to pay additional royalties on past or future sales  our cost of product revenue would increase 
cost related to product and service billings cost related to product and service billings  which is a non gaap measure  includes the cost of products delivered and invoiced to our customers  the cost directly attributable to the sale of software only products by our oem partners and the cost of services in the current period 
cost related to product billings is recorded as deferred product and service cost until such time as the related deferred revenue is recognized as revenue 
at the time of revenue recognition  we expense the related deferred product and service costs in our income statement as cost of revenue 
deferred product and service costs cost related to product billings for invoiced shipments and software only license fees for which revenue is not recognized in the current period is recorded as deferred product cost 
in addition  when the company performs development services that are essential to the functionality of the initial delivery of a new product where the associated revenues have been deferred due to the fact that they do not qualify as units of accounting separate from the delivery of the software  the company defers direct and incremental development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the costs deferred consist of employee compensation and benefits for those employees directly involved with performing the development  as well as other direct and incremental costs 
all costs incurred in excess of the related revenues are expensed as incurred 
deferred product and service costs increases each fiscal period by the amount of product and service costs associated with product and service billings that are deferred in the period and decreases by the amount of product and service costs associated with revenue recognized in the period 
we classify deferred product cost that we expect to recognize during the next twelve months as current deferred product and service costs on our balance sheet 
as of december   million of deferred product cost was included in current assets and million of deferred service cost was included in long term assets 
gross profit our gross profit represents revenue recognized during the period less related cost and is primarily attributable to oem product shipments and software license fees 
our gross profit varies from period to period according to the mix of revenue from hardware products  software products and services 
gross profit on billings our gross profit on billings  a non gaap measure  represents product and service billings during the period less cost related to product and service billings and is primarily attributable to oem product shipments and software 
table of contents license fees 
our gross profit on billings varies from period to period according to our mix of billings from hardware products  software products and services 
due to the nortel networks bankruptcy filing on january   we excluded the million of pre bankruptcy filing outstanding invoices to nortel networks from billings for the quarter and year ended december  as a result  our gross profit on billings was reduced by the same amount for the quarter and year ended december  operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation related to our engineers  cost of prototypes and test equipment relating to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  and other related overhead costs 
we expense all research and development cost as it is incurred 
our research and development is performed by our engineering personnel in the united states  india and the united kingdom 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts  which we believe are essential to maintaining our competitive position and the development of new products for new markets 
accordingly  we expect research and development expense to remain similar in amount through fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation related to our sales  marketing and customer support personnel  commissions payable to our sales personnel  travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  marketing program expenses  and other related overhead costs 
we expense sales commissions at the time they are earned  which typically is when the associated product and service billings are recorded or when a customer agreement is executed 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in amount and as a percentage of product and service billings for the foreseeable future as we continue to augment our sales and marketing functions  primarily outside the united states 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation related to our executive  finance  legal  human resource and administrative personnel  professional services costs  and other related overhead costs 
general and administrative expense has increased in amount and as a percentage of product and service billings in and we expect this trend to continue in as we invest in infrastructure to support continued growth and incur additional expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including additional audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  disclosure obligations and other regulations  investor relations expense and insurance premiums 

table of contents stock based compensation expense we adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal sfas no 
r addresses all forms of shared based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
based on current stock option grants  we expect to recognize a future expense for non vested options of million over a weighted average period of years as of december  we expect stock based compensation expense will increase for the foreseeable future as we expect to continue to grant stock based incentives to our employees 
operating income on billings operating income on billings  which is a non gaap measure  varies from period to period according to the amount of gross profit on billings less operating expenses for the period 
interest income  net interest income  net  primarily relates to interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
in fiscal  interest income was partially offset by interest expense from our outstanding debt and non cash interest expense relating to our preferred stock warrants 
cash flow from operating activities customer collections and  consequently  cash flow from operating activities are driven by sales transactions and related product and service billings  rather than recognized revenues 
we believe cash flow from operating activities is a useful measure of the performance of our business because  in contrast to income statement profitability metrics that rely principally on revenue  cash flow from operating activities captures the contribution of changes in deferred revenue and deferred charges 
we present cash flow from operating activities because it is a metric that management uses to track business performance and  as such  is a key factor in our incentive compensation program 
in addition  management believes this metric is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of software companies with significant deferred revenue balances 
due to the nortel networks bankruptcy filing on january   we excluded the million of pre bankruptcy filing outstanding invoices to nortel networks from accounts receivable for the quarter and year ended december  in addition  we had approximately million to million of unbilled amounts related to royalties earned through january  the collection of these amounts is subject to nortel networks bankruptcy proceedings  and as a result  we can not determine when we may collect these amounts  if at all 
these amounts will be treated on a cash basis  as collected 
we expect cash flows for the first quarter of to be negatively impacted by million to million  representing the total amount of billed and unbilled amounts due from nortel networks at the time of the filing 
cash and investments we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling million as of december  and million as of december  our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments are invested primarily in money market funds  high grade government sponsored enterprises aaa a  high grade commercial paper a p  and high grade corporate notes a a 
we do not invest in any types of asset backed securities such as those backed by mortgages or auto loans 
none of our investments have incurred defaults or have been downgraded 
we do not hold auction rate securities 
we hold unrestricted cash and cash equivalents for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we have an investment policy that guides our investing activities 
among other things  our investment policy limits the concentration of our investments in any one issuer with the exception of investments in us treasury and us agency debt obligations and sec registered money market funds to no more than of the book value of 
table of contents our investment portfolio at the time of purchase 
currently  we have investments in one issuer  the value of which equals approximately of our portfolio 
we intend to reduce our investment in this issuer as the securities mature to meet the concentration limits of our investment policy 
we are otherwise in compliance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs  maximize yields and maintain proper fiduciary control over our investments

critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and ii the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the licensing of software products and software upgrades  the sale of hardware products  maintenance and support services  and the sale of professional services  including training 
our products incorporate software that is more than incidental to the related hardware 
accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition 
under multiple element arrangements where several different products or services are sold together  we allocate revenue to each element based on vsoe of fair value 
we use the residual method when fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in a multiple element arrangement 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and subsequently recognized when earned 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate element  the undelivered items must not be essential to the functionality of the delivered item and there must be vsoe of fair value for the undelivered items in the arrangement 
fair value is generally limited to the price charged when the we sell the same or similar element separately or  when applicable  the stated substantive renewal rate 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
for example  in situations where we sell a product during a period when we have a commitment for the delivery or sale of a future specified software upgrade  we defer revenue recognition until the specified software upgrade is delivered 
significant judgments in applying the accounting rules and regulations to our business practices principally relate to the timing and amount of revenue recognition given our current concentration of revenues with one customer and our inability to establish vsoe of fair value for specified software upgrades 
we sell our products primarily through oem arrangements with telecommunications infrastructure vendors such as nortel networks 
we have collaborated with our oem customers on a best efforts basis to develop initial 
table of contents product features and subsequent enhancements for the products that are sold by a particular oem to its wireless operator customers 
for each oem customer  we expect to continue to develop products based on our core technology that are configured for the requirements of the oem s base stations and its operator customers 
this business practice is common in the telecommunications equipment industry and is necessitated by the long planning cycles associated with wireless network deployments coupled with rapid changes in technology 
large and complex wireless networks support tens of millions of subscribers and it is critical that any changes or upgrades be planned well in advance to ensure that there are no service disruptions 
the evolution of our infrastructure technology therefore must be planned  implemented and integrated with the wireless operator s plans for deploying new applications and services and any equipment or technology provided by other vendors 
given the nature of our business  the majority of our sales are generated through multiple element arrangements comprised of a combination of product  maintenance and support services and  importantly  specified product upgrades 
we have established a business practice of negotiating with oems the pricing for future purchases of new product releases and specified software upgrades 
we expect that we will release one or more optional specified upgrades annually 
to determine whether these optional future purchases are elements of current purchase transactions  we assess whether such new products or specified upgrades will be offered to the oem customer at a price that represents a significant and incremental discount to current purchases 
because we sell uniquely configured products through each oem customer  we do not maintain a list price for our products and specified software upgrades 
additionally  as we do not sell these products and upgrades to more than one customer  we are unable to establish vsoe of fair value for these products and upgrades 
consequently  we are unable to determine if the license fees we charge for the optional specified upgrades include a significant and incremental discount 
as such  we defer all revenue related to current product sales  software only license fees  maintenance and support services and professional services until all specified upgrades committed at the time of shipment have been delivered 
for example  we recognize deferred revenue from sales to an oem customer only when we deliver a specified upgrade that we had previously committed 
however  when we commit to an additional upgrade before we have delivered a previously committed upgrade  we defer all revenue from product sales after the date of such commitment until we deliver the additional upgrade 
any revenue that we have deferred prior to the additional commitment is recognized after the previously committed upgrade is delivered 
if there are no commitments outstanding for specified upgrades  we recognize revenue when all of the following have occurred delivery fob origin  provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  as long as all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if there are uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  we recognize revenue and related cost of revenue when those uncertainties are resolved 
any adjustments to software license fees are recognized when reported to us by an oem customer 
for arrangements where we receive initial licensing fees or customization fees for new products under development  we defer recognition of these fees until the final product has been delivered and accepted  and then we recognize the fees over the expected customer relationship period 
revenue from pre production units is deferred and recognized once the final product has been delivered and accepted  provided that the other criteria for revenue recognition are met  including but not limited to the establishment of vsoe of fair value for post contract support 
if vsoe of fair value cannot be established for undelivered elements  we defer all revenues until vsoe of fair value can be established or the undelivered element is delivered 
if the only remaining undelivered element is post contract support  we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual post contract support period 
for arrangements that include annual volume commitments and pricing levels  where such discounts are significant and incremental and where the maximum discount to be provided can not be quantified prior to the expiration of the arrangement  we recognize revenue  provided that delivery and acceptance has occurred and provided that no other commitments such as specified upgrades are outstanding  based on the lowest pricing level stated in the arrangement 
any amounts invoiced in excess of the lowest pricing level are deferred and recognized ratably over the remaining discount period  which typically represents the greater of the pcs period or the remaining contractual period 

table of contents for our direct sales to end user customers  which have not been material to date  we recognize product revenue upon delivery provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our support and maintenance services consist of the repair or replacement of defective hardware  around the clock help desk support  technical support and the correction of bugs in our software 
our annual support and maintenance fees are based on a percentage of the initial sales or list price of the applicable hardware and software products and may include a fixed amount for help desk services 
included in the price of the product  we provide maintenance and support during the product warranty period  which is typically one year 
as discussed above  we defer all revenue  including revenue related to maintenance and support services post contract customer support or pcs  until all specified upgrades outstanding at the time of shipment have been delivered 
in connection with an amendment to the company s oem arrangement with nortel network in  we can no longer assert vsoe of fair value for pcs to nortel networks 
when vsoe of fair value for pcs cannot be established  all revenue related to product sales and software only license fees  including bundled pcs  is deferred until all specified software upgrades outstanding at the time of shipment are delivered 
at the time of the delivery of all such upgrades  we recognize a proportionate amount of all such revenue previously deferred based on the portion of the applicable warranty period that has elapsed as of the time of such delivery 
the unearned revenue is recognized ratably over the remainder of the applicable warranty period 
when vsoe of fair value for pcs can be established  we allocate a portion of the initial product revenue and software only license fees to the bundled pcs based on the fees we charge for annual pcs when sold separately 
when all specified software upgrades outstanding at the time of shipment are delivered  under the residual method  we recognize the previously deferred product revenue and software only license fees  as well as the earned pcs revenue  based on the portion of the applicable warranty period that has elapsed 
the unearned pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the remainder the applicable warranty period 
notwithstanding our inability to establish vsoe of fair value of maintenance and support services to nortel networks under sop no 
for revenue recognition purposes  we present product revenue and service revenue separately on our consolidated statements of income based on historical maintenance and support services renewal rates at the time of sale 
for maintenance and service renewals  we recognize revenue for such services ratably over the service period as services are delivered 
we provide professional services for deployment optimization  network engineering and radio frequency deployment planning  and provides training for network planners and engineers 
we generally recognize revenue for these services as the services are performed as we have deemed such services not essential to the functionality of our products 
we have not issued any refunds on products sold 
as such  no provisions have been recorded against revenue or related receivables for potential refunds 
in addition  certain of our contracts include guarantees regarding failure rates 
historically  the we have not incurred substantial costs relating to these guarantees and we currently expense such costs as they are incurred 
we review these costs on a regular basis as actual experience and other information becomes available  and should they become more substantial  we would accrue an estimated exposure and consider the potential related effects of the timing of recording revenue on our license arrangements 
we have not accrued any costs related to these warranties in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees  we classify the reimbursement by customers of shipping and handling costs as revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue 
we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both product and services revenues and as a direct cost of product and services in accordance with eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
for fiscal  and  shipping and handling and reimbursable out of pocket expense were not material 
we have neither issued nor do we anticipate issuing any refunds on products sold 
as such  no provisions have been recorded against deferred revenues  revenue or any related receivables for potential refunds 
we anticipate that the revenue recognition related to the our fixed mobile convergence products will be complex given that a number of our current arrangements for the development and supply of these products contain significant customization services  volume discounts  specified upgrades and multiple elements for new service 
table of contents offerings for which vendor specific evidence of fair value does not currently exist 
to date  there have been no material revenues recognized with respect to these products 
investments and restricted investments we determine the appropriate categorization of investments in securities at the time of purchase 
as of december  and december   our investments were categorized as held to maturity and are presented at their amortized cost 
we classify securities on our balance sheet as short term or long term based on the date we reasonably expect the securities to mature or liquidate 
as of december   we held securities in an unrealized loss position totaling less than  the unrealized losses on these individual securities were less than of amortized cost and represented less than of total amortized cost of all investments 
given the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities that are in an unrealized loss position at december   we concluded there is no other than temporary impairment on any of these investments

sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize the compensation cost of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award  which is generally four to five years  and have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value 
sfas no 
r eliminated the alternative of applying the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
to stock compensation awards 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r on the first day of fiscal using the prospective transition method 
as such  we will continue to apply apb opinion no 
in future periods to equity awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to july   the date of our ipo  we determined the volatility percentage used in calculating the fair value of stock options it granted based on an analysis of the historical stock price data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility percentage used in determining the fair value of stock options granted in the year ended december  was between and and in the year ended december  was between and 
the expected life of options was determined utilizing the simplified method as prescribed by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payments and sfas r 
the expected life of options granted during the year ended december  was between and years and during the year ended december  was years 
for the years ended december  and december   the weighted average risk free interest rates used were and  respectively 
the risk free interest rate is based on a weighted average of a year and year treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
although we paid a one time special cash dividend in april  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during fiscal and fiscal was per share and per share  respectively 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period  whereas sfas no 
permitted companies to record forfeitures based on 
table of contents actual forfeitures  which was our historical policy under sfas no 
as a result  we applied an estimated forfeiture rate of for the year ended december  and between and for the year ended december  in determining the expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
these rates were derived by review of our historical forfeitures since for the years ended december  and december   we recorded expenses of  and  respectively  in connection with share based awards and related tax benefit of approximately and for fiscal and  respectively 
as of december   future expense for non vested stock options of  was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the adoption of sfas no

we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
under sfas no 
 we determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must then periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

 which is an interpretation of sfas no 
fin no 
creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
by prescribing the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
on january  we did not recognize any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of adopting fin no 
as of january  our fin no

we do not invest in any types of asset backed securities such as those backed by mortgages or auto loans 
none of our investments have incurred defaults or have been downgraded 
we do not hold auction rate securities

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we have an investment policy that guides our investing activities

fiscal year in thousands cash and cash equivalents investments  short term accounts receivable working capital cash flow from operating activities cash flow from investing activities cash flow from financing activities on january   nortel networks announced that it and certain of its affiliates had filed for bankruptcy protection 
at the time of that filing  we had outstanding invoices to nortel networks in the amount of million and approximately million to million of unbilled amounts related to royalties earned through january  the collection of these amounts is subject to nortel networks bankruptcy proceedings and it is likely that a portion or all of these amounts will not be collected 
had nortel networks not filed for bankruptcy protection  these amounts would likely have been paid in due course in the first quarter of we expect cash flows for the first quarter of to be negatively impacted by million to million  representing the total amount of billed and unbilled invoices due from nortel networks at the time of the filing 
in connection with the announcement  nortel networks informed us that it will continue to purchase goods and services from us and that we are a long term partner and a key supplier to nortel networks 
purchases subsequent to the filing date will be under the terms of nortel networks current agreement with us 
we intend to work with nortel networks to assume its agreement with us 
if nortel networks assumes its agreement with us  nortel networks would be required to become current in all of its outstanding obligations to us  including obligations outstanding prior to the filing date 
if the agreement is not assumed  all outstanding obligations billed and unbilled invoices will be subject to discharge and we likely will not be able to collect these receivables in full

cash flow from operating activities is generally derived from net income  fluctuations of current assets and liabilities and to a lesser extent non cash expenses 
in fiscal  our net income of million exceeded our cash flow from operating activities by million primarily as a result of a decrease in deferred revenue of million and increases in accounts receivable of million associated with a significant increase in billings in the fourth quarter and prepaid taxes of million  partially offset by a reduction in deferred charges of million

our ability to

the timing of tax payments also impacts cash flow from operating activities from period to period 
tax payments do not necessarily match pretax income or loss in a given period due to permanent and temporary differences in taxable income including deferred revenue and deferred charges 
we paid million in fiscal in federal  state and foreign taxes

we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least one operating cycle months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our product and service billings growth  the introduction and market acceptance of new products  the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities  and the timing of our revenue recognition and related income tax payments 
to the extent that our cash  cash equivalents and investments and cash from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may be required to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products 
in the event we require additional cash resources  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect any equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all

however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities
