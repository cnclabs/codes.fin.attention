item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of southwest water 
the md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the md a also contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements on page of this report for additional information 
overview southwest water s principal business activity is to operate and maintain water and wastewater infrastructure 
through our operating subsidiaries  we own systems and operate hundreds more under contract to cities  utility districts and private companies 
southwest water was incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in we maintain our corporate offices in los angeles  california 
in the past ten years  we have completed over acquisitions of both utility and contract service businesses 
these acquisitions operated largely independent of each other  resulting in a complex business structure with varying business practices 
in  our board of directors appointed a new chief executive officer to  among other things  review company operations and plan for future growth 
beginning in  we implemented changes to better integrate the various segments of the business 
in and  we made a major change to how we operate  we consolidated many of the departments that provide common support functions such as environmental health and safety  our financial and accounting services  information technology and our customer call center 
these consolidated departments allocate their costs to each operating segment 
in  our operations were divided into four operating segments to better focus the distinct strategies of each of our operating businesses 
each segment has imbedded in it the direct operating cost and infrastructure to deliver its plan  relying upon the allocated common support functions discussed above 
each operating segment is led by a managing director and a financial director 
we believe this management structure brings both direct operational and financial management accountability to each of the operations 
as a result of this reorganization  we now have four reporting segments 
we separate our segments first by whether we own the utility or we provide contract services to others 
our owned water and wastewater utilities are referred to as our utilities operations utilities 
in our financial statements we report our texas utilities operations texas utilities as a separate segment because of different economic characteristics 
this is principally because the texas utilities predominantly under recovered their current cost of service  which includes a reasonable return on equity  as we have made large investments in these operations since acquisition that are not yet being recovered through the rates we charge 
our contract operations are segmented by contract type into those that are generally larger  stand alone operations o m services and those that are small  full service contracts operated by a common team of personnel resulting in a model that proportions a fractional cost to each client texas mud services 
utilities consist of our owned water and wastewater utilities located in california  alabama  mississippi and our recently sold new mexico utility see item  legal 
table of contents proceedings for detailed information on the new mexico utility sale 
residential customers make up the largest component of our utilities customer base  with these customers representing approximately of our water and wastewater connections 
substantially all of our utilities customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for each customer s water consumption 
each of the operations in this segment has a unique service territory that is subject to state and federal regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters 
the rates that we can charge for water and wastewater service include the opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on investments in these utilities as approved by state regulatory agencies  except for some of our alabama wastewater rates which are governed by our service agreements 
some of these governmental agencies approve a forward looking recovery of costs and some approve recovery of costs based on a historical test year backward looking 
our utilities operations are characterized by ongoing capital investments to maintain and enhance the reliability and quality of the service we provide  as well as routine growth from rate increases and new connections 
texas utilities consists of small  mostly rural systems that are grouped into nine jurisdictional utilities across texas 
residential customers make up the largest component of our texas utilities customer base  with these customers representing approximately of our water and wastewater connections 
substantially all of our texas utilities customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers water consumption 
these systems are broadly dispersed geographically 
the majority of the systems are organized as one utility with a single tariff  known as monarch utilities 
the monarch systems  as well as two smaller systems acquired in  were in various stages of disrepair at the time of acquisition and we continue to spend significant amounts of capital to maintain regulatory compliance and to improve the quality of service 
we are not yet recovering all of these costs in our rates and as a result  we have a lower rate of return than typically expected from a utility 
we intend to actively pursue recovery of these costs in the rate setting process 
all other aspects of operations for these utilities are the same as our utilities operations  therefore  as soon as we are recovering our costs  including a reasonable return on equity  we expect to aggregate this segment with our utilities segment 
o m services generally consists of operations that are project specific contracts with cities  public agencies and private owners 
most contracts are stand alone operations staffed with project specific personnel  with an average contract life of two to three years 
under a typical o m contract  we charge a fee that covers a specified level of service that includes facility operations and maintenance and may include other water or wastewater related services 
services are typically provided evenly throughout the contract period and are billed on a monthly basis 
if we provide services beyond the scope of a contract  we bill for the additional services on a time and materials basis or negotiate a unique price 
these contracts are largely located in california  colorado  alabama  mississippi  and georgia 
texas mud services is a full service provider of utility services to a large number of small utilities in texas that are mostly owned by municipal utility districts mud 
a mud is created to provide water supply  wastewater treatment and drainage service to areas where municipal services are not available 
we service over mud clients with a common team of client managers  operators  customer service and billing personnel 
therefore  these contracts are allocated a proportional amount of each cost center creating a business model that is significantly different from that of o m services 
under a typical mud contract  we bill a monthly base fee to provide a specified level of service  
table of contents usually water and or wastewater facility inspections  routine operations  equipment maintenance  and utility customer service including meter reading  call center  dispatch  billing and collection services 
we bill for any additional services provided beyond the basic contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
most contracts provide for an increase in the monthly base fee as the number of customer connections increases and generally include inflation adjustments 
the majority of our mud contracts are cancelable with to day prior notice by either party  but tend to last for long periods due to the close working relationships between the operators and the clients 
no one district represents more than of the overall revenue of this segment 
impacts to results of operations utilities texas utilities our utilities segments results of operations are generally influenced by a variety of factors that are similar between the two segments and the industry in general 
a more complete understanding of these factors can be gained by reviewing this section along with the risk factors section herein 
as we review and discuss performance  the general areas of impact we evaluate are as follows growth related growth in our utilities segments is generally characterized by the following drivers  growth in the number of connections served within existing utility certified service areas  or acquisition of new service areas 
in our utilities segment  our largest utility is our california utility which is a substantially built out system that does not generally see much change in connection count 
the majority of our other utilities are in markets that experienced significant new home construction in ranging from to annual growth  but saw this growth significantly decline in and in this growth averaged less than across all systems 
growth through acquisitions was most significant in with the acquisition of a  connection wastewater utility system in alabama in early as well as the full year impacts of some smaller acquisitions made in texas in rate related each of our utilities will increase rates from time to time as allowed by the regulator or governing contract  to recover expenses and realize a return on invested capital 
rate cases can take months or years to impact results due to the time needed to prepare  present and ultimately receive approval from the regulator 
in each of our utilities  we have a long term rate strategy that matches our expectation for growth  regulatory change and demand 
in  we were actively pursuing rate increases in our california  texas  new mexico and alabama utilities 
our texas utilities benefited in from a full year impact of an interim rate increase from our monarch rate filing  which was resolved through an all party settlement in december by march this rate case settlement will have resulted in phased in water rate increases totaling 
the settlement also required us to refund an estimated million impacting revenue 
we also reached all party settlements in three smaller pending texas rate cases 
at our california utility as part of our rate case settlement  we were authorized step rate increases in and of and  respectively 
in alabama we have a contractual agreement with the local government over our shelby county wastewater utility that provides us with the ability to request rate increases annually  pursuant to the terms of the contract 
accordingly  we requested and received increases in january of both and additionally  we were actively working with our regulators in on additional rate cases that will impact and beyond 
in california we worked with the cpuc on 
table of contents our general rate case which was settled in the first quarter of for an increase over our rates at the beginning of in new mexico we filed for and received a rate rider surcharge 
surcharges were required to be deposited in escrow as they were collected 
they relate to our dispute with the entity that treats and disposes of our sewage  who was also the entity seeking to acquire our utility through eminent domain 
at the closing of the sale through eminent domain in may  million was distributed to us from funds collected through the rate rider 
in alabama  we applied for a rate increase under our shelby county wastewater utility contract and received permission to raise rates in january demand related the need for our water is a major driver of our operating results 
our utility results are largely dependent upon the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary greatly with rainfall and temperature levels 
not only does rainfall vary from season to season  but from year to year 
the uniform rate design that regulators require for our utilities can result in unrecovered fixed costs and lower earnings during periods of abnormally low water use 
this can occur during abnormal weather conditions  such as when summer temperatures are cooler than normal or during mandatory restrictions on water use because of drought 
also  demand related changes can occur as a result of conservation and socio economic impacts 
demand related changes often impact both the revenue of the utility and the cost of production 
in we saw increased demand and demand related costs in texas due to drought conditions 
we saw lower demand at our california utility in  largely due to conservation and socio economic conditions associated with the decline in general economic conditions 
supply related the cost of water and related commodities is a major driver of our results 
utilities that purchase water are subject to changes in operations due to the amount and cost of that water 
purchased water supply changes are typically driven by longer term climate issues such as extended drought but can also be driven by short term maintenance needs 
in  we saw increased cost of production in texas as we purchased more water than in previous years at a higher cost per gallon  due to the inability of our owned sources of ground water to produce enough water to meet the heightened demand due to drought conditions 
operation maintenance related o m our operation and maintenance costs include fuel  power  labor  labor benefits  facility costs  and other ordinary costs of producing or treating water 
these costs are impacted by compliance with environmental and health safety standards 
they are also typically subject to inflation effects and while we can file for recovery after inflation effects are incurred in backward looking rate making jurisdictions  we often experience a lag between the time we incur these costs and when we receive the rate increase to cover these costs 
in california  which is a forward looking rate making environment  we estimate the impacts of inflation in our rate filings and must absorb any costs that are different than our estimates 
general administrative related g a our general and administrative costs include expenses directly incurred by the segment such as management expense as well as costs for services performed by consolidated support functions that are then allocated to each segment 
these support costs include it  shared financial services  customer service center and environmental health and safety 
in and  we made large investments in our consolidated support functions that have 
table of contents driven costs higher  but we now have a foundation upon which to drive sustainable continuous improvement into the organization 
as the efficiencies of these investments take hold  we have targeted objectives to reduce the fixed costs of supporting our operations 
other other is reserved for unusual items that may impact results from time to time 
most significantly in our texas utilities impaired goodwill by million and our utility in new mexico expensed million in costs related to the settlement of a sewer fee dispute and eminent domain proceedings 
o m services segment our o m services segment results of operations are generally influenced by a variety of factors 
as we review and discuss performance  the general areas of impact we evaluate are as follows contract growth growth is generally due to new contracts  additional project work under existing contracts and contract price increases 
our primary driver of contract growth in and has been from increased contract pricing and expanding the scope of work provided to existing customers 
lost work lost work is generally driven by lost contracts or a reduction in project work for existing contracts 
we lost a number of contracts in and due to increased competition in our service territories  specifically in the southeast 
we also cancelled two of our contracts in california in due in part to the financial under performance of the contracts 
general administrative related g a our general and administrative costs include expenses directly incurred by the segment such as management expense as well as costs for services performed by consolidated support functions that are then allocated to each segment 
these support costs include it  shared financial services  customer service center and environmental health and safety 
in and  we made large investments in our consolidated support functions that have driven costs higher but we now have a foundation upon which to drive sustainable continuous improvement into the organization 
as the efficiencies of these investments take hold  we have targeted objectives to reduce the fixed costs of supporting our operations 
other other is reserved for unusual items that may impact results from time to time  such as legal fees  fines or the elimination of certain service offerings 
most significantly in and  we eliminated certain non core service offerings including electrical contracting and construction management  and incurred legal fees including reserves for potential compliance related fines 
texas mud services segment our texas mud services segment s results of operations are generally influenced by a variety of factors 
as we review and discuss performance  the general areas of impact we evaluate are as follows contract growth new contracts  additional project work and contract price increases are offset by lost contracts  reductions in project work  or a reduction in other ancillary services such as new taps and inspection services for new home construction 
in and we lost a number of contracts due to increased competition in our service territories and our ancillary service work was significantly impacted due to reduced taps and inspection services associated with the slowdown in new home construction 

table of contents general administrative related g a our general and administrative costs include expenses directly incurred by the segment such as management expense as well as costs for services performed by consolidated support functions that are then allocated to each segment 
these support costs include it  shared financial services  customer service center and environmental health and safety

as the efficiencies of these investments take hold  we have targeted objectives to reduce the fixed costs of supporting our operations 
other other is reserved for unusual items that may impact results from time to time 
most significantly in and  we discontinued offering non core service offerings including specialty pipe rehabilitation work and bookkeeping services 
corporate segment our corporate segment represents costs related to executive management  investor relations  human resources  general legal and insurance  certain it functions that support all operations and public company needs  audit costs  and other expenses generally related to the parent organization 
most of the costs are general and administrative in nature and not subject to much variation 
on occasion  we do have other costs that flow through the segment 
in and  the expenses associated with the cornerstone project were largely supported by the corporate segment 
this project upgraded our core it infrastructure such as phones  servers and communications links 
in addition  as of january  we are operating on a single company wide financial ledger system 
in the fourth quarter of  the remaining portions of the project were put on hold and certain portions of the project were eliminated  resulting in an impairment of the capital investment of million 
total project expenses were million in and million in  which includes the costs to suspend the project 
the total capital investment in and was million and million respectively  of which million has been placed into service 
in may  the company  based on additional current information  determined that it was not probable that the implementation of the remaining uncompleted software modules would be completed and recorded a charge of million during the quarter ended june  acquisitions our financial position  results of operations and cash flows have been affected by our history of acquisitions 
our most recent significant acquisitions  which affect the comparability of the historical financial condition and results of operations described in the md a  are utilities a birmingham  alabama based wastewater collection and treatment system that serves approximately  residential and commercial connections in a service area directly adjacent to our existing shelby county collection and treatment system  acquired in january  a madison county  alabama based wastewater collection and treatment system servicing approximately connections acquired in november  and  
table of contents a northern mississippi based water and wastewater utility serving approximately water connections and servicing approximately wastewater connections through four collection systems acquired in february texas utilities two san antonio  texas based water utilities serving approximately  connections acquired in may  and  two austin  texas based water utilities serving connections acquired in assets held for sale and dispositions during  we committed to a plan to sell our wholesale water and wastewater operations in texas 
in december  we completed the sale of our wholesale wastewater business for net cash proceeds of million and a receivable of million 
the wastewater treatment plant sold represents a portion of the combined water and wastewater operations assets and liabilities 
we are uncertain whether we can consummate the sale of the remaining business during  accordingly  the business activity of the water component will be reflected in consolidated continuing operations in we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our southwest environmental laboratories  inc subsidiary in for cash consideration of million paid at close and up to an additional million of consideration consisting of of the buyer s quarterly aggregate invoice amounts subsequent to the sale 
the sale closed on april  in january we reached a settlement in eminent domain proceedings against our new mexico utility  new mexico utilities inc nmui 
on may  we received million in cash at closing million settlement and million escrow release  less million retained by the condemning entity in settlement of sewer treatment fees 
we used million of the net proceeds to pay down nmui bonds and the remaining cash proceeds of million was used to pay any unassumed liabilities of nmui and to pay down our revolving credit facility 
results of operations compared to consolidated operating revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
consolidated operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for resulting operating income decreased million  or  to a loss of million for the year ended december   from operating income of million for the prior year

the terms of the long term debt are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the bank line of credit bears interest at variable rates and therefore the amount of future interest payments are uncertain 
borrowings bear interest  at our option  based on a margin either a over libor  or b under the prime rate 
the margins vary based on our consolidated debt to equity ratio 
the weighted average annual interest rate on our bank line of credit borrowings was at december  million has been included as a payment in related to the nmui settlement and the resulting repayment of the nmui mortgage bonds 
interest on the mortgage bonds is fixed at a weighted average annual interest rate of and is payable semiannually

excludes preferred stock dividend obligations 
preferred stockholders are entitled to receive annual dividends of per share and there are  shares of preferred stock outstanding at december  the preferred stock is redeemable by the company at any time for per share and  from time to time  we have elected to repurchase shares offered to us by preferred stockholders at prices less than per share 
financial condition we expect our existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations 
our business is capital intensive  requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses  construction expenditures  and interest and dividend payments 
during and in subsequent years  we may from time to time satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash from operations and funds from the capital markets as conditions warrant 
we expect that borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will continue to be available to manage working capital during those periods 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at december  we also had million of operating lease obligations at december  that are payable during we have access to million in financing under a revolving credit facility that expires february  a total of eight banks participate in the facility 
at december   we were operating under an amendment to our credit agreement  primarily allowing for additional time with regards to financial filings 
we had million of additional borrowings available under our revolving credit facility  which expires on february  subsequent to the end of the year  we entered into additional amendments to our credit agreement which waived existing and anticipated defaults  specifically related to additional time with regards to financial filings and with regard to the debt to capitalization ratio 
the agreement requires we maintain a ratio below 
we anticipated the impact of the restatement on our retained earnings  combined with the additional borrowings on the facility during  would create a default under the debt to capitalization covenant 
the default was cured due to the second amendment to the credit agreement dated may  our credit facility was reduced from million to million as part of the second amendment  leaving million of available liquidity on the facility under the new amendment as of may  our ability to comply with financial covenants  pay principal or interest and refinance our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance as well as other factors beyond our control 
continued opportunity for operating improvements  cash management and suspension of elective capital should improve our ability to comply with the covenants in the revolving credit facility 
as of december   our debt to 
table of contents capitalization ratio was 
as of june   our debt to capitalization ratio was estimated at 
under the amendments discussed above  we also were provided additional time to file our september  and march  quarterly reports on form q 
it is our intention to meet the extended filing deadlines provided in the amendment  and to remain current on our filings thereafter 
the credit agreement and amendments are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as part of the amended credit agreement with our primary working capital line  we have agreed to only utilize up to an additional million under our capital lease facility 
our california and new mexico mortgage bond indentures permit the issuance of an additional million of first mortgage bonds at december  however  the terms of our revolving credit facility do not permit additional first mortgage bond indebtedness without prior consent from the credit facility lenders 
the mortgage bond indentures also limit the amount of cash and property dividends our california and new mexico utilities paid to the parent company 
dividends have averaged million to million per year and are less than the aggregate cumulative dividend restriction threshold by million at december  we were in compliance with or obtained waivers for all loan agreement covenants during the year ended december  we have on file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which is effective for the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of common stock  debt securities and warrants 
to date we have issued approximately million of common stock under the shelf registration  and about million remains available for issuance at december  as we were unable to timely file our required sec filings for the september  and march  quarterly reports on form q and our annual report on this form k  we can not use registration statements on form s for registration of our securities with the sec at this time 
use of form s requires  among other things  that the issuer be current and timely in its reports under the exchange act for at least twelve months 
accordingly  we will have to meet more demanding requirements to register additional securities  which may make it more difficult for us to effect public offering transactions  and our range of available financing alternatives could be limited 
in january we reached a settlement of eminent domain proceedings against our new mexico utility 
on may  we received million in cash at closing million settlement and million escrow release  less million retained by abcwa in settlement of sewer treatment fees 
we used million of the net proceeds to pay down nmui bonds and we used the remaining cash proceeds of million to pay any unassumed liabilities of nmui and to pay down our revolving credit facility 
certain contractual commitments and indemnities at december   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the amount of million issued and outstanding under our credit facility 
during our normal course of business  we have entered into agreements containing indemnities pursuant to which we may be required to make payments in the future 
these indemnities are in connection with facility leases and liabilities and operations and maintenance contracts entered into by our contract services businesses 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is 
table of contents indefinite 
substantially all of these indemnities provide no limitation on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make and is not quantifiable 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities 
off balance sheet arrangements through the date of this report  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our subsidiaries

our future operating lease payment obligations are more fully described under the caption contractual obligations above 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates and judgments are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made and they are evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis 
to the extent our estimates and judgments are different than actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies we use in preparing our financial statements and are important to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial position and results of operations 
regulated utility accounting our regulated utilities are subject to regulation by the public utility commissions and the local governments of the states in which they operate the regulators 
these regulators have allowed recovery of costs and credits which we have recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities 
accounting for future recovery of costs and credits as regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
this statement sets forth the application of gaap for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
in accordance with sfas  costs and credits on the balance sheet are deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the income statement in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged for water and wastewater service 
in the event that our assessment as to the probability of the inclusion in the rate making process is incorrect  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in assessment or change in regulatory approval 

table of contents two of our alabama wastewater utilities in the utilities segment and a wholesale water and wastewater business wholly owned by one of the companies within the texas utilities segment do not meet the criteria for application of sfas because the rates charged by these entities are not established by or subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
three of our utilities in the texas utilities segment and a mississippi utility in the utilities segment do not meet the criteria for application of sfas because their current rate structures do not allow full recovery of cost of service 
our remaining utilities in both the utilities and the texas utilities segments do meet the criteria for application of sfas historically  our contract service companies provided construction  operations and maintenance services to our new mexico utility and recognized a profit on those services 
in accordance with sfas  we did not eliminate the services profit recognized on these services because we believed the sales price was reasonable and it was probable that  through the rate making process  future utilities revenue approximately equal to the sales price would result from the regulated utilities use of the services 
we did  however  eliminate revenue to the extent of the related costs in our consolidated financial statements 
in  we stopped this practice and have subsequently restated the performance of prior periods by charging all costs from operations of the new mexico utility within the utilities segment 
the o m services and mud services now reflect only third party service revenue 
revenue recognition water utility revenue is recognized when water is delivered to customers 
estimated amounts for unbilled revenue for water usage since the previous billing period of million and million at year end and  respectively were accrued 
unbilled revenue is determined using several factors including the timing of accounting period end relative to the length of the billing cycle  the weather and consumption patterns of one accounting period versus another and the timing of rate increases between one accounting period and another 
revenue for contract operations is recognized and billed at the end of the month based on a monthly fee to provide a specific level of service as outlined in each individual contract 
we generally bill for additional services provided beyond the scope of the base contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
estimates of work completed  but not yet billed were utilized to estimate revenue for the period of million and million at year end and  respectively 
certain non refundable activation fees in our non regulated wholesale water operations are recognized over the expected period of performance 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets for the years ended december   and  the company s goodwill totaled million and  million respectively 
as required by sfas  we test goodwill annually  as of october  for impairment at the reporting unit level  or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable  in which case  an interim test is performed 
the company uses a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any in accordance with sfas for each of the company s reporting units 
the step calculation used  to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value for 
table of contents each of the company s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values  including goodwill  on the measurement date 
if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value  step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 
the step calculation of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of the reporting unit s identified assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 
the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 
the estimated fair value of the company s utility reporting units are based on a combination of the following valuation techniques comparable equity securities of publicly traded water utilities observable trading prices  considered by us to be the company s peers  and discounted cash flow models developed from the company s internal forecasts 
the estimated fair values of the services reporting units are determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models 
the comparable technique applies average peer company multiples to the company s utility reporting units historic and forecasted cash flows 
the peer company multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publicly traded water utilities  their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers 
the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit s five year cash flows using an estimated long term growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital 
in conjunction with the step one calculation  we also reconcile the difference between the calculated market capitalization and the aggregate carrying value of the reporting units to ensure that any excess is supportable by relevant market information 
we make certain assumptions  which we believe to be appropriate  that support this reconciliation 
we consider  in addition to the listed trading price of the company s shares  the applicability of a control premium to the company s shares and certain other factors we may deem appropriate 
as a result  we may conclude that the company s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  we perform the second step of the impairment test 
in this step  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the impairment charge  if any  is measured as the difference between the implied fair value of the goodwill and its carrying value 

table of contents during  charges totaling million were recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
during annual impairment testing at october   global market events  including the credit market crisis  resulted in declines in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities and a decline in our stock price 
these combined factors led to a lower estimated fair market value for all of our segments 
discounted cash flows models were updated based upon the current expectations of future period performance and consideration for past performance 
the discount rate was adjusted for texas utilities from in to in the discount rate was adjusted for utilities from in to in the discount rate was adjusted for mud services from in to in the discount rate was adjusted from in to in for o m services 
the increase in all discount rates reflects the factors that are commonly considered in determining premiums  including  risks related to financial projections  access to capital markets  litigation regulatory risk  among others 
in addition  the discount rates were higher related to the general cost of capital increase associated with both debt and equity markets 
the higher discount rates in the service related business units as compared to the utilities business units can generally be attributed to the less secure nature of our service revenue contracts as compared to the nature of the more stable revenue from the utilities 
an increase of in the discount rates would not alter the results of our testing 
based on updated projections and the impacts of the market conditions  we impaired the entire million of goodwill associated with our texas utilities and another million of goodwill associated with our alabama utilities in  leaving goodwill of million  million and million in the o m services  texas mud services and utilities segments  respectively 
on december  our stock price was trading at a week low point 
due to the continued decline in our stock price and the stock price of many of our peers  we performed an impairment test as of this date  but no additional impairment was identified 
subsequent to year end  the market valuation of the company and many of its peers has improved  and no other events have been identified that would require an interim testing of impairment 
during  charges totaling million were recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill 
during  the company committed to a plan to sell its wholesale water and wastewater operations in texas 
as a result  the operations and cash flows for these operations are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
intangible and other long lived assets are assessed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of those assets 
an additional impairment of million was recorded against other long lived assets during we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance 
these market events could include additional declines over a period of time of our stock price  a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities  the lack of an increase in our market price consistent with peer companies  or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect 
a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan  such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates  could also result in an impairment charge 
recognition of impairments of a significant portion of 
table of contents goodwill would negatively affect our reported results of operations and total capitalization  the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings  secure financing on attractive terms  maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 
share based compensation we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
this option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require subjective assumptions such as the expected future volatility of the stock price 
because the stock options we grant have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the calculated results  in management s opinion  the stock option valuation models  including black scholes  may not necessarily provide an exact measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized stock compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively  using the black scholes option valuation model 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements and conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the financial condition of the company and results of operations may differ from the estimates and assumptions made by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements accompanying this report 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in order to recognize future tax effects attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as the recognition of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period that the enactment occurs 
we file a consolidated us federal income tax return  which includes all of our subsidiaries 
liabilities are recorded for probable income tax assessments based on estimates of potential tax related exposures 
accounting for these assessments requires significant judgment as uncertainties often exist with respect to existing tax laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and assumptions  or changes in assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
our california and new mexico regulated utilities recorded additional deferred income taxes  as well as corresponding regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities as permitted by the cpuc and the nmprc  respectively 
in addition  unamortized investment tax credits 
table of contents have been deferred and are amortized over the estimated productive lives of the related assets as allowed by the cpuc and the nmprc 
on january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin creates a single model to address the accounting for the uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before recognition in the financial statements 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit expense to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit expense that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
any tax position recognized would be an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
fin allows the company to prospectively change its accounting policy as to where interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities are classified 
historically  our accounting policy is to classify interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities above the line on our consolidated statement of earnings 
at december  and  the company did not have liabilities for uncertain tax positions that were material 
the company s policy is to classify interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax benefits above the line of the consolidated statements of operations 
there were no material interest and penalties incurred during the years ended december  and recent accounting pronouncements refer to the recent accounting pronouncements discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  included in part ii
