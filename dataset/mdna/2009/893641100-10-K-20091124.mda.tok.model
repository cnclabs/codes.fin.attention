item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data and td group s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the heading entitled risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we believe we are a leading global designer  producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today 
our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers 
some of our more significant product offerings  substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end users in the aerospace industry  include mechanical electromechanical actuators and controls  ignition systems and components  gear pumps  specialized valves  engineered connectors  power conditioning devices  specialized fluorescent lighting  specialized ac dc electric motors  aircraft audio systems  engineered latches and cockpit security devices  lavatory hardware and components  hold open rods and locking devices  specialized cockpit displays  elastomers  nicad batteries and chargers  starter generators and related components 
each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 
for fiscal year  we generated net sales of million and net income of million 
in addition  for fiscal year  our ebitda was million  or of net sales  our ebitda as defined was million  or of net sales  and our capital expenditures were million  or of net sales 
see ebitda and ebitda as defined below for certain information regarding ebitda and ebitda as defined  including a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and ebitda as defined and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined 
we estimate that over of our net sales for fiscal year were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design 
these products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers who often certify only one manufacturer s component design for a specific application on an aircraft  government agencies and or the faa and similar entities or agencies 
in addition  for fiscal year  we estimate that we generated approximately of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 
most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue 
once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft  we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft 
this installed base and our sole source provider position generate a long term stream of aftermarket revenues over the estimated year life of an individual aircraft 
we estimate that approximately of our net sales in fiscal year were generated from aftermarket sales  the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets 
these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have been more stable than sales to oems 
in fiscal year  our top two customers accounted for approximately of our net sales  and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our net sales 
however  our components are ultimately used on a large  diverse installed base of aircraft and  therefore  we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate end users of our products 
in the commercial aerospace sector  which generated approximately of our net sales for fiscal year  we sell to distributors of aftermarket components  as well as directly to commercial airlines  aircraft maintenance facilities  systems suppliers  and aircraft and engine oems 
in addition  for fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector 
net sales to the defense sector are generated 
table of contents primarily through sales to the united states and foreign militaries  brokers  distributors and defense oems 
the remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year  or approximately of our net sales during this period  were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining and power generation industries

trend information we predominantly serve customers in the commercial  regional  business jet and general aviation aftermarket  which accounts for approximately of total sales  the commercial aerospace oem market  comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers  which accounts for approximately of total sales  and the defense market  which accounts for approximately of total sales 
non aerospace sales comprise approximately of our total sales 
the commercial aerospace industry  including the aftermarket and oem market  is impacted by the health of the global economy and geo political events around the world 
the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles  or rpms  between and  as well as increases in oem production and backlog  however  the global economic downturn  airline capacity reductions and concerns over the financial credit markets have negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly in the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 
our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk 
we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry  and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft  which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform 
at times  declines in sales in one sector have been offset by increased sales in another 
however  due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers  variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 
there are many short term factors including inventory corrections  unannounced changes in order patterns  strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause short term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years 
to normalize for short term fluctuations  we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet short term periods 
as such  it can be difficult to determine longer term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 
there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter to quarter  as well as variations in product mix from quarter to quarter  that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems 
again  in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

table of contents commercial aftermarket the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft 
although rpms increased annually between and  industry consensus indicates that will have had negative growth as a result of expected reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy 
industry reports expect rpms to stabilize in and return to positive growth thereafter 
commercial oem market there is industry consensus that aircraft deliveries in the large commercial transport market sector aircraft with or more seats may reach its peak in however  there are conflicting industry opinions regarding the level of future deliveries  but we believe deliveries may be flat or decrease going forward 
another indicator of future oem sales in this market is the order backlog at the boeing company and airbus sas despite a significant number of airplanes in the backlog  current year orders for new airplanes have decreased from the prior year and the availability of financing is uncertain due to the current state of the credit markets 
furthermore  the business jet oem market significantly declined in and is expected to continue to decrease in the near future 
this market has also been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth  corporate profits  commodity prices and stock market returns across the world 
defense in recent years  defense spending has reached historic highs  due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 
our military business fluctuates from year to year  and is dependent  to a degree  on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products will be flat in over the current high levels 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends 
these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition and related allowances substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the customer  at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm  fixed price purchase orders received from customers 
provisions for returns  uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified  as appropriate  by the most current information available 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances  however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness 
the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers 
management s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information 
the 
table of contents determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management 
if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate  management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products 
the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company s operations  ranging from days to six years 
in addition  certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions 
the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources 
the company also provides a general amount based on historical results 
historically  actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first in  first out fifo methods for all locations except cef  which determines the cost of inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in service for or more years  it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels  past usage and future sales forecasts 
although management believes that the company s estimates of obsolete and slow moving inventory are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future 
in addition  in accordance with industry practice  all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales  even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 
intangible assets mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed or exchanged  regardless of the company s intent to do so 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data 
the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required 
intangible assets  such as goodwill  trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
gaap requires that the annual  and any interim  impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level 
the reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the company 
substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction  and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment 
certain of the acquisitions were or are being integrated into an existing operating subsidiary  and therefore any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary 
stock options and deferred compensation plans the company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options vesting periods 
compensation expense is recorded over the service period using the straight line method for service based awards and in the service period corresponding to the performance target for performance based awards 
in addition  the company accounts for its deferred compensation plans by recording the cost of deferred compensation arrangements over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner 

table of contents purchase accounting our mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method 
accordingly  fair value adjustments to the company s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition 
we generally use third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data of the company  including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales  amounts in thousands fiscal years ended of sales of sales of sales net sales cost of sales selling and administrative amortization of intangibles income from operations interest expense  net income tax provision net income fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year sales of million resulted from the acquisitions of cef and the unison product line in fiscal as well as the recent acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation  acme and the woodward hrt product line 
sales declined excluding acquisitions by million or from the prior year 
the organic sales decline was primarily due to i a decrease of million of commercial oem sales resulting primarily from the impact of the significant decline in production rates in the business jet market resulting from the continued impact of global economic conditions negatively impacting the business jet market and a reduction in sales to the boeing company due to its employee strike  and ii a decrease of million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the impact of the global economic downturn resulting in a decline in worldwide airline traffic and business jet activity 
partially offsetting the decline in organic commercial sales was an increase of million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for oem and aftermarket spare parts and repairs across most of our product lines 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from from fiscal year cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of million discussed above and higher acquisition related costs of million 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due the strength of the company s proprietary products  productivity improvements from continued cost reduction efforts and favorable product mix partially offset by the dilutive impact from recent acquisitions and higher acquisition related costs 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million  of net sales  for fiscal year from million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the higher sales discussed above 

table of contents amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased by million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily due to the recent acquisitions discussed above 
income from operations 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above 
interest expense net 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a reduction in interest income of million 
the company s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately billion during both fiscal and year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately during fiscal from for the comparable period last year see liquidity and capital resources below 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the research and development tax credit 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year sales growth excluding acquisitions was million and represented an increase over the prior year 
the organic sales growth was primarily due to i an increase of million of military sales primarily resulting from increased demand for aftermarket spare parts across most of our product lines  ii an increase of million of commercial oem sales primarily resulting from an increase in production rates from the boeing company and airbus sas and related oem suppliers  and iii an increase of million of commercial aftermarket sales despite being negatively impacted by an increase in the replacement time period for certain cockpit security components  as well as  modest system wide inventory fluctuations 
the remaining million increase in net sales resulted from the acquisition of of cef in fiscal and the businesses of ati and bruce in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from from fiscal year cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of million discussed above  partially offset by a million decrease  or of net sales  in acquisition related costs 
the decrease in acquisition related expenses was primarily due to inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs recorded in the prior year of million related to the acquisitions of ati and cda partially offset by current year inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs of million primarily related to the acquisitions of bruce and cef 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due a decrease from acquisition related costs discussed above  the strength of the company s proprietary products and continued productivity efforts  partially offset by the impact from the acquisitions of ati  bruce and cef 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the higher sales discussed above and an increase in research and development expenses of million primarily relating to the boeing program  partially offset by the non recurring charge of million relating to the secondary offering recorded in the prior year 

table of contents amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles decreased by million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year income from operations 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above 
interest expense net 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to an increase in our debt of approximately million from the acquisition ati in february  partially offset by lower interest rates and higher interest income of million 
the company s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately billion during fiscal compared to approximately billion during the comparable period last year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately during fiscal from for the comparable period last year see liquidity and capital resources below 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in state and local taxes  an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of a prior year irs audit and state tax refund of million partially offset by a lower research and development tax credit 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 
backlog as of september   the company estimated its sales order backlog at million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of million as of september  this decrease in backlog of million is mainly due to lower commercial oem and aftermarket demand including the impact of order cancellations and pushouts as well as significant reductions in business jet production rates 
these declines were partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation  acme and the woodward hrt product line 
the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september  are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months 
purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment 
the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  the company s backlog as of september  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 
foreign operations although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states  we manufacture some products in malaysia through our wholly owned malaysian subsidiary 
we sell our products in the united states  as well as in foreign countries 
substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and  therefore  we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales 
in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers  including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary  are not material  with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 
our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
sales to foreign customers are subject to 
table of contents numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
inflation many of the company s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which could result in changing operating costs 
the effects of inflation on the company s businesses during the fiscal years  and were not significant 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million generated during fiscal the increase of million in fiscal is primarily due to an increase in net income of million partially offset by the payout of the deferred compensation liability of and the change in income taxes receivable including the impact of the excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to million generated during fiscal the increase of million in fiscal is primarily due to an increase in net income of million and favorable changes in accounts receivable and inventory of approximately million 
investing activities

cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of cef and unison for a total of million and capital expenditures of million 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of ati  cda  and bruce for a total of million and capital expenditures of million 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal related to the exercise of stock options of million partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock for million 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal of million related to the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal of million consisted of the proceeds received of million  net of fees  from the issuance of additional senior subordinated notes and additional term loans of million  net of fees  to finance the acquisition of ati and million related to the exercise of stock options 
description of current senior secured credit facility and indenture in june transdigm refinanced its entire debt structure 
in connection with the refinancing  transdigm inc obtained a new senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility consisted of a million term loan facility  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million revolving loan facility 
in addition  under 
table of contents the terms of the senior secured credit facility  transdigm inc had the right to request but no lender was committed to provide additional term loans of up to million  subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions  including pro forma compliance with the financial covenant contained in the senior secured credit facility after giving effect to any such incremental term loan borrowings 
in connection with the acquisition of ati in february  transdigm inc entered into an amendment of the senior secured credit facility  which provided for  among other things  i an additional term loan of million  ii a million increase in the revolving credit facility bringing the total available revolver to million  and iii a million increase in the uncommitted incremental loan facility to million 
at september   million of the revolving credit facility was available 
the term loan facility will mature in june and is not subject to interim scheduled amortization  but is subject to certain prepayment requirements 
under the amended terms of the senior secured credit facility  commencing days after the end of fiscal and each fiscal year thereafter  transdigm inc is required to prepay outstanding term loans in a principal amount equal to of excess cash flow as defined in the senior secured credit facility  provided that the amount of the prepayment will be reduced to of excess cash flow if the consolidated leverage ratio at the end of the applicable fiscal year is less than to  but greater than to 
transdigm inc will not be required to prepay any of the term loans if the consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal year is equal to or less than to or if the term loans achieve certain minimum credit ratings at the end of such fiscal year 
excess cash flow is a negotiated definition generally designed to capture the cash that was generated by our business in excess of cash used in the business 
consolidated leverage ratio means the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to the aggregate amount of ebitda as defined  calculated on a pro forma basis 
transdigm s consolidated leverage ratio was approximately to at september   thus the company was not obligated to make a prepayment of the term loans based upon the excess cash flow provision 
in addition  subject to exceptions including reinvestment in productive assets  transdigm inc is required to offer to prepay the term loans with the net proceeds of certain asset sales 
the revolving loan facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in june the senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by td group and all of transdigm inc s current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of transdigm inc and all of transdigm inc s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  and a first priority pledge of the capital stock of transdigm inc and transdigm inc 
s domestic subsidiaries 
the interest rates per annum applicable to loans  other than swingline loans  under the senior secured credit facility are  at the company s option  equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libo rate for one  two  three or six month or to the extent available to each lender  nine or twelve month interest periods chosen by transdigm inc  in each case  plus an applicable margin percentage 
the alternate base rate is the greater of credit suisse s prime rate or basis points over the weighted average rates on overnight federal funds as published by the federal reserve bank of new york 
the adjusted libo rate is determined by reference to settlement rates established for deposits in dollars in the london interbank market for a period equal to the interest period of the loan as adjusted for the maximum reserve percentages established by the board of governors of the united states federal reserve 
the applicable margin percentage is a percentage per annum equal to for alternate base rate term loans  for adjusted libo rate term loans  in the case of alternate base rate revolving loans and adjusted libo rate revolving loans  a percentage which varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio of transdigm inc as of the relevant date of determination 
transdigm inc entered into a three year interest rate swap in june with credit suisse for an initial notional amount of million at a fixed rate of 
the notional amount decreased to million on september   and the swap agreement expired on june  transdigm inc entered into an additional three year interest rate swap in january with credit suisse for the notional amount of million at a fixed rate of through march
