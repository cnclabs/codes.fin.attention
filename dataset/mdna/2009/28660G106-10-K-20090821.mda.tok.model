table of contents effective june   we became the exclusive  global licensee for the sale  manufacture  distribution and marketing of the liz claiborne fragrance brands under a long term license agreement with liz claiborne  inc and certain of its affiliates 
the liz claiborne fragrance portfolio consists of the juicy couture  curve by liz claiborne  lucky  liz  realities  bora bora and mambo fragrances 
in connection with the liz claiborne license agreement we also assumed a license for the usher celebrity fragrances 
the liz claiborne licensing arrangement should enable us to i grow our market share in our north america fragrance segment  ii increase our gross margins in our north america fragrance segment by converting existing mass customer sales from distribution margins to owned licensed margins  and iii add sales volume to our international segment  particularly with the juicy couture fragrance brand 
in fiscal  we incurred transition expenses relating to the liz claiborne license agreement of approximately million  before taxes 
in addition  our gross margins for the first half of fiscal were impacted by expenses of approximately million which did not require the use of cash in the current period  before taxes  relating to liz claiborne inventory that we purchased at a higher cost prior to the effective date of the license agreement 
in fiscal  we incurred expenses related to the liz claiborne transaction of million  before taxes 
in addition  in connection with this license we discontinued certain brands and products resulting in a product discontinuation charge in fiscal of million  before taxes 
in fiscal  we commenced a comprehensive review of our global business processes to re engineer our extended supply chain  distribution  logistics and transaction processing systems 
we call this initiative our global efficiency re engineering initiative 
in may  we announced an acceleration of the re engineering of our extended supply chain functions as well as the realignment of other parts of our organization to better support our new business processes 
in connection with this initiative  in july we completed the first phase of the implementation of an oracle financial accounting system general ledger and accounts payable in accordance with our projected timeline and plan to complete the remaining portion of the financial accounting system as well as the order processing system in the second half of fiscal the system is intended to improve key transaction processes and accommodate the anticipated growth of our business 
we expect this infrastructure investment to simplify our transaction processing by utilizing a common platform to centralize our primary global transaction processing functions 
as a result of the acceleration of the re engineering of our extended supply chain functions and the implementation of the oracle financial accounting and order processing system  and the migration to a shared services transaction processing model we have implemented a restructuring plan that will result in restructuring and one time expenses  including severance  relocation  recruiting and temporary staffing expenditures 
we expect these expenses to be incurred primarily in fiscal years and and currently estimate that they will total million to million before taxes 
through june   we have incurred a total of million before taxes  which includes million related to our oracle implementation  and million for initiative related restructuring 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe are most likely to occur 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates  which are recorded in the period in which they become known 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
if these changes result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements  their impact is disclosed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures below logo 
table of contents also note situations in which it is reasonably likely that future financial results could be affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
the term reasonably likely refers to an occurrence that is more than remote but less than probable in the judgment of management 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position which delayed the effective date of sfas for those non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november  with respect to financial assets and liabilities  sfas became effective for us on july  for non financial assets and liabilities  sfas became effective for us on july  the adoption of sfas with respect to financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements 
we are evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the application of sfas with respect to non financial assets and liabilities 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail below 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of these and other accounting polices 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets 
under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  the purchase costs  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
commencing on july  we will be adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ  and the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that require more judgment is determining the fair value and useful lives of intangible assets 
in this process  we often obtain the assistance of third party valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we discontinue or experience a decline in the profitability of one or more of our brands  the value of the intangible assets associated with those brands or their useful lives may decline  or  certain intangible assets such as the elizabeth arden brand trademarks  may no longer be classified as an indefinite lived asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses  trademarks and other intellectual property  customer relationships and lists  noncompete agreements and goodwill 
the value of these assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives such as our elizabeth arden trademarks  are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
we typically perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not fully be recoverable 
there is a two step process for impairment logo 
table of contents testing of goodwill 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets to their respective carrying values 
if an impairment is identified  the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to estimated fair value 
we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks have indefinite useful lives as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
during the quarter ended june   we completed our annual impairment testing of the elizabeth arden trademarks and goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
in assessing the fair value of these assets  we considered both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value is based on quoted market prices and the number of shares outstanding of our common stock 
under the income approach  the fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the analysis and assessments of these assets indicated that no impairment adjustment was required as the estimated fair value of these intangible assets exceeded the recorded carrying value 
a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our north america fragrance reporting unit would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of our elizabeth arden trademarks or a hypothetical increase in the discount rate used to estimate fair value would not result in an impairment of our elizabeth arden trademarks 
however  the capital markets continue to experience substantial volatility and on the date of our annual impairment test and subsequent to that date  our net book value exceeded our market capitalization 
in management s judgment  a significant portion of the recent declines in our stock price is related to the deterioration of macroeconomic conditions  including substantial volatility of the capital markets  and is not reflective of the expected underlying cash flows of our reporting units 
due to the ongoing uncertainty in capital market conditions  which may continue to negatively impact our market value  we will continue to monitor and evaluate the expected future cash flows of our reporting units and the long term trends of our market capitalization for the purposes of assessing the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived elizabeth arden trademarks  other trademarks and intangible assets 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate further  this could increase the likelihood of future material non cash impairment charges to our results of operations related to our goodwill  indefinite lived elizabeth arden trademarks  or other trademarks and intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
periodically  we review the lives assigned to our long lived assets and adjust the lives  as circumstances dictate 
because estimated useful life is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we experience significant declines in net sales in certain channels of distribution  it could affect the estimated useful life of certain of our long lived assets  such as counters or trade fixtures  which could result in additional charges to net income 
long lived assets 
we review for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
because the fair value is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
the same circumstances that could affect the estimated useful life of a long lived asset  as discussed above  could cause us to change our estimate of the fair value of that asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
logo 
table of contents revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns  markdowns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns and markdowns represents management s estimate of future returns and markdowns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product for credit against amounts previously billed or to receive a markdown allowance 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical and projected experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
such provisions and markdown allowances are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
because there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the allowance for returns and markdowns  it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates 
if  for example  customer demand for our products is lower than estimated  additional provisions for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
as a percentage of gross sales  our expense for returns and markdowns was  and for the fiscal years ending june   and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for sales returns and markdowns as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates  which may result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required  resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
because of the subjective nature of this estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  demand for our products declines or if we decide to discontinue certain products  we may need to increase our provision for inventory obsolescence which would result in additional charges to net income 
a hypothetical change in the value of our provision for inventory obsolescence as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
hedge contracts 
we have designated each qualifying foreign currency contract we have entered into as a cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  associated with these contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
share based compensation 
all share based payments to employees  including the grants of employee stock options  are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values  but only to the extent that vesting is considered probable 
compensation cost for awards that vest will not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of market based restricted stock awards is determined using a monte carlo simulation model  and the fair value of all other restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation costs for awards are amortized using the straight line method 
option pricing model logo 
table of contents input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility and risk free interest rate impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions are based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we rely on our historical experience and post vested termination activity to provide data for estimating our expected term for use in determining the fair value of our stock options 
we currently estimate our stock volatility by considering our historical stock volatility experience and other key factors 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using our historical experience 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimates 
because of the significant amount of judgment used in these calculations  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate  additional charges to net income may be required 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged or credited to net income in the period in which such determination was made 
we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not that such position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits 
while we believe that our assessments of whether our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained are reasonable  each assessment is subjective and requires the use of significant judgments 
as a result  one or more of such assessments may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could result in a change to net income 
subsequent events 
effective june   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 subsequent events sfas 
management has evaluated subsequent events through august   which is the date the financial statements were issued 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

our principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  including brand development and marketing expenses  new product launches  additional brand acquisitions or product licensing and distribution arrangements  capital expenditures and debt service 
in addition  we may use funds to repurchase our common stock and senior subordinated notes 
we have historically financed our working capital needs primarily through internally generated funds  our credit facility and external financing 
we collect cash from our customers based on our sales to them and their respective payment terms 
we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  for which jpmorgan chase bank is the administrative agent  which generally provides for borrowings on a revolving basis 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in order to accommodate the increased working capital requirements associated with the growth of our business  in july  the credit facility was amended to increase its size from million to million  with a million sub limit for letters of credit 
under the terms of the credit facility we may  at any time  increase the size of the credit facility up to million without entering into a formal amendment requiring the consent of all of the banks  subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions 
the credit facility expires in december the credit facility is guaranteed by all of our us subsidiaries and is collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our us  canada and puerto rico accounts receivable and us inventory

our obligations under the credit facility rank senior to our senior subordinated notes due the credit facility has only one financial maintenance covenant  which is a debt service coverage ratio that must be maintained at not less than to if average borrowing base capacity declines to less than million million from december through may 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may pay dividends or repurchase common stock if we maintain borrowing base capacity of at least million from june to november  and at least million from december to may  after making the applicable payment 
the credit facility restricts us from incurring additional non trade indebtedness other than refinancings and certain small amounts of indebtedness 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facility for the year ended june  borrowings under the credit portion of the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the applicable margin  which is determined by reference to a specific financial ratio 
at our option  the applicable margin may be applied to either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the reference ratio for determining the applicable margin is a debt service coverage ratio 
the applicable margin charged on libor loans ranges from to and is for prime rate loans  except that the applicable margin on the first million of borrowings from august to october of each year  while the temporary increase in our borrowing base is in effect  is higher

the borrowing availability under the credit facility typically declines in the second half of our fiscal year as our higher accounts receivable balances resulting from holiday season sales are likely to decline due to cash collections 
at june   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by our us subsidiaries 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the indenture pursuant to which the senior subordinated notes were issued provides that such notes will be our senior subordinated obligations 
the senior subordinated notes rank junior to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  including indebtedness under the credit facility  and pari passu in right of payment to all of our senior subordinated indebtedness 
interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually on february and august of each year 
the indenture generally permits us subject to the satisfaction of a fixed charge coverage ratio and  in certain cases  also a net income test to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  purchase or redeem our common stock or redeem subordinated indebtedness 
the indenture generally limits our ability to create liens  merge or transfer or sell assets 
the indenture also provides that the holders of the senior subordinated notes have the option to require us to repurchase their notes in the event of a change of control involving us as defined in the indenture 
based upon our internal projections  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months  other logo 
table of contents than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands  new product launches or licensing or distribution arrangements 
a further deterioration in the economic and retail environment  however  could cause us to fail to satisfy the financial maintenance covenant under our bank credit facility that applies only in the event we do not have the requisite average borrowing base capacity as set forth under the credit facility 
in such an event  we would not be allowed to borrow under the revolving credit facility and may not have access to the capital necessary for our business 
in addition  a default under our credit facility that causes acceleration of the debt under this facility could trigger a default under our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under our credit facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be

for the year ended june   we purchased  shares of common stock on the open market under the stock repurchase program at an average price of per share and at a cost of million  including sales commissions 
the acquisition of these shares by us was accounted for under the treasury method
