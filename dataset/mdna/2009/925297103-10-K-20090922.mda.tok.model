the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to increased gross revenues and improved operating margins during fiscal year during fiscal year  the company recorded a  loss on marketable securities that the company was holding in the fisco income plus fund 
the fisco fund received an immediate demand margin call from its broker  ubs 
rather than allow the fund the customary time to satisfy the margin call at the end of the day  ubs demanded the fund cover all calls and puts at high premiums immediately or indicated it would take control of the fund and start liquidating the fund 
the fund has terminated its relationship with ubs and transferred the assets to a new custodian 
the fund is currently taking legal action against ubs to cover its losses 
the company has participated in any recovery from such action to date 
during the remaining periods of fiscal year  the company recovered  of the initial loss before the funds were liquidated from the fisco fund 
the company has liquidated its remaining assets from marketable securities and now holds them in depository accounts with its primary bank due to the volatile nature of the market 
interest expense for fiscal year was  compared to interest income of  in fiscal year the increase in interest expense was due to costs associated with capital leases and the financing of insurance premiums and the lower federal prime rate of interest resulting in no offsetting interest income received on funds held by the company in its bank depository account due to the lower federal prime rate 
income tax expense for fiscal year was  a decrease of  compared to that reported for fiscal year income tax expense for fiscal year increased by  over that reported in fiscal year primarily due to the release of the company s tax valuation allowance during fiscal year resulting in a tax benefit of  for fiscal year during fiscal year  the company was carrying a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets

in addition  the company s current ratio at june  was  compared to reported on june  the company s financial ratios have continued to improve due to the company s strong financial performance during fiscal year accounts receivables increased by approximately million primarily due to changes in contract vehicles that have caused payment delays

these covenants require a minimum tangible net worth of million  a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  and a minimum current ratio of at least to borrowings under the renewed line of credit will be at prime less with a floor interest rate of 
failure to meet the covenant requirements gives the bank the right to demand outstanding amounts due under the line of credit  which may impact the company s ability to finance its working capital requirements

information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition contracts in process are stated at the lower of actual costs incurred plus accrued profits or incurred costs reduced by progress billings 
on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
the company records income from major fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may affect the revenue recognition on a project 
revisions to such estimates are made when they become known 
detailed quarterly project reviews are conducted with project managers to review all project progress accruals and revenue recognition 
there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of the company s business on projects where the company is contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability and collectibility 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management reviews outstanding receivables on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectibility of such receivables 
all receivables over days old are reviewed as part of this process 
net deferred tax asset the company has approximately million in net deferred tax assets as of june  during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company released the entire million tax valuation allowance that was previously established against such assets due to the improved earnings and likelihood of realizing such deferred tax assets in future periods 
asset retirement obligation during fiscal year  the company recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with the estimated clean up costs for its chemical laboratory in its national security business segment 
in accordance with sfas  the company estimated the costs to clean up the laboratory and return it to its original state at a present value of approximately  the company currently estimates the amortization and accreation expense to be approximately  to  per year over the next years 
the company is rigorously pursuing reimbursement for such costs and other costs from the us army as a significant portion of the chemical agent that was used in the chemical laboratory was government owned 
if the company determines that the estimated clean up cost is larger than expected or the likelihood of recovery from the us army is remote  such adjustments will be reflected when they become known in accordance with sfas at june   the company has accrued approximately  long term liability to clean up the chemical laboratory 
goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is approximately  relating to the acquisition of versar global solutions  inc  which is now part of the program management business segment 
the program management business segment was broken out separately in fiscal year  primarily due to the increase in business volume in iraq and in the united states construction related work 
in performing its goodwill impairment analysis  management has utilized a market based valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the program management business segment 
management engages outside professionals and valuation experts annually  as necessary  to assist in performing this analysis and would test more often if events and circumstances warrant it 
an analysis was performed on public companies and company transactions to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of the program management business segment exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of million on an enterprise value basis by a substantial margin 
should the program management business segment s financial performance not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether a write down of goodwill value would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact the company s cash flow or financial debt covenants
