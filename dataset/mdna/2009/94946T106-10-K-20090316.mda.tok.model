item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
services coverage medicaid the medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve effectively our constituencies in the communities in which we operate 
although our medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members  in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive 
our medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care 
in general  members are required to use our network  except in cases of emergencies  transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs  and generally must receive a referral from their primary care physician pcp in order to receive health care from a specialist  such as an orthopedic surgeon or neurologist 
members do not pay any premiums  deductibles or co payments for most of our medicaid plans 
medicare through our medicare advantage plans  we also cover a wide spectrum of medical services 
we provide additional benefits not covered by original medicare  such as vision  dental and hearing services 
through these enhanced benefits  the out of pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced  which allows our members to better manage their health care costs 
most of our medicare advantage plans require members to pay a co payment  which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided 
typically  members of our ccps are required to use our network of providers except in cases such as emergencies  transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs 
ccp members may see an out of network specialist if they receive a referral from their pcp and may pay incremental cost sharing 
pffs plans are open access plans that allow members to be seen by any physician or facility that participates in the medicare program  is willing to bill us for reimbursement and accepts our terms and conditions 
we have some flexibility in designing benefits packages and we offer benefits that original medicare fee for service coverage does not offer 
our pilot ppo plans offer members the option to seek any services outside of our contracted network but  in such case  they are subject to higher cost sharing 
we also offer special needs plans for those who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid d snps  which are ccps  in most of our markets 
d snps are designed to provide specialized care and support for medicare beneficiaries  including those who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid  with frailties or serious chronic conditions 
we believe that our d snps are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs 
the medicare part d benefit  which provides prescription drug benefits  is available to medicare advantage enrollees as well as original medicare enrollees 
we offer part d coverage in many forms  including stand alone pdps and as a component of many of our medicare advantage plans 
depending on medical coverage type  a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can either join a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
pffs beneficiaries can join a pffs plan that has part d drug coverage or join a plan without such coverage and choose either to obtain a drug benefit from a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in ccps or ppos can join a plan with part d coverage or forego part d coverage 

table of contents provider networks we contract with a wide variety of health care providers to provide our members with access to medically necessary services 
our contracted providers deliver a variety of services to our members  including primary and specialty physician care  laboratory and imaging  inpatient  outpatient  home health and skilled facility care  medication and injectable drug therapy  ancillary services  durable medical equipment services  mental health and chemical dependency counseling and treatment  transportation  and dental  hearing and vision care 
the following are the types of providers in our medicaid and ccp contracted networks professionals such as pcps  specialty care physicians  psychologists and licensed master social workers  facilities such as hospitals with inpatient  outpatient and emergency services  skilled nursing facilities  outpatient surgical facilities  diagnostic imaging centers and laboratory providers  ancillary providers such as home health  physical therapy  speech therapy  occupational therapy  ambulance providers and transportation providers  and pharmacies  including retail pharmacies  mail order pharmacies and specialty pharmacies 
these providers are contracted through a variety of mechanisms  including agreements with individual providers  groups of providers  independent provider associations  integrated delivery systems and local and national provider chains such as hospitals  surgical centers and ancillary providers 
we also contract with other companies who provide access to contracted providers  such as pharmacy  dental  hearing  vision  transportation and mental health benefit managers 
pcps play an important role in coordinating and managing the care of our medicaid and ccp products 
this coordination includes delivering preventive services as well as referring members to other providers for medically necessary services 
pcps are typically trained in internal medicine  pediatrics  family practice  general practice and  in some markets  obstetrics and gynecology 
in rare instances  a physician trained in sub specialty care will perform primary care services for a member with a chronic condition 
to help ensure quality of care  we credential and recredential all professional providers  including physicians  psychologists  licensed master social workers  certified nurse midwifes  advanced registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants who provide care under the supervision of a physician  directly or through delegated arrangements 
this credentialing and recredentialing is performed in accordance with standards required by cms and consistent with the standards of the national committee for quality assurance ncqa 
our typical professional and ancillary agreements provide for coverage of medically necessary care and have terms of one year 
these contracts automatically renew for successive one year periods unless otherwise specified in writing by either party 
these contracts typically can be cancelled by either party  without cause  upon days written notice 
facility  pharmacy  dental  vision and behavioral health contracts cover medically necessary services and  under some of our plans  enhanced benefits 
these contracts typically have terms of one to four years 
these agreements may also automatically renew at the end of the contract period unless otherwise specified in writing by either party 
during the contract period  these agreements typically can be terminated without cause upon written notice by either party  but the notification period may range from to days and early termination may impose financial penalties on the terminating party 
the contract terms require providers to participate fully with our quality improvement and utilization review programs  which we may modify from time to time  as well as applicable state and federal regulations 
provider reimbursement methods physicians and provider groups we reimburse some of our pcps on a fixed fee per member per month  or pmpm  basis 
this type of reimbursement methodology is commonly referred to as capitation 
the reimbursement covers care provided directly by the pcp as well as coordination of care from other providers as described above 
in certain markets  services such as vaccinations  laboratory or screening services delivered by the pcp may warrant reimbursement in addition to the capitation payment 
further  in some markets  pcps may also be eligible for incentive payments for achieving certain measurable levels of compliance with our clinical guidelines covering prevention and health maintenance 
these incentive payments may be paid as a periodic bonus or when submitting documentation of a member s receipt of services 
in all instances  we require providers to submit data reporting all direct encounters with members 
this data helps us to monitor 
table of contents the amount and level of medical treatment provided to our members and to improve our compliance with regulatory reporting requirements to ensure our contracted providers are providing appropriate medical care 
our regulators use the encounter data that we submit  as well as data submitted by other health plans  to set reimbursement rates  assign membership  assess the quality of care being provided to members and evaluate contractual and regulatory compliance 
we are reviewing our payment and data collection methods  particularly under capitated arrangements  to improve the accuracy and completeness of our encounter data 
pcps in our ccp products and  in rare instances  in our medicaid products  are eligible for a specialized risk arrangement to further align our interests with those of the pcps 
under these arrangements  we establish a risk fund for each provider based on a percentage of premium received 
we periodically evaluate and monitor this fund on an individual or group basis to determine whether these providers are eligible for additional payments or  in the alternative  whether they should pay us 
payments due to us are carried forward and offset against future payments 
specialty care providers and  in some cases  pcps  are typically reimbursed a specified fee for the service performed  which is known as fee for service 
the specified fee is set as a percentage of the amount medicaid or medicare would pay under the fee for service program 
in rare instances  specialty care provider groups in certain regions are paid a capitation rate to provide specialty care services to members in those regions 
for the year ended december   approximately of our payments to physicians serving our medicaid members were on a capitated basis and approximately were on a fee for service basis 
during the year ended december   approximately of our payments to physicians serving our medicare members in ccps were on a capitated basis and approximately were on a fee for service basis 
facilities inpatient services are typically reimbursed as a fixed global payment for an admission based on the associated diagnosis related group  or drg  as defined by cms 
in many instances  certain services  such as implantable devices or particularly expensive admissions  are reimbursed as a percentage of hospital charges either in addition to  or in lieu of  the drg payment 
certain facilities in our networks are reimbursed on a negotiated rate paid for each day of the member s admission  known as a per diem 
this payment varies based upon the intensity of services provided to the member during admission  such as intensive care  which is reimbursed at a higher rate than general medical services 
facility outpatient services facility outpatient services are reimbursed either as a percentage of charges or based on a fixed fee schedule for the services rendered  in accordance with ambulatory payment groups or ambulatory payment categories  both as defined by cms 
outpatient services for diagnostic imaging and laboratory services are reimbursed on a fixed fee schedule as a percentage of the applicable medicare or medicaid fee for service schedule or a capitation payment 
ancillary providers ancillary providers  who provide services such as home health  physical  speech and occupational therapy  and ambulance and transportation services  are reimbursed on a capitation or fee for service basis 
pharmacy services pharmacy services are reimbursed based on a fixed fee for dispensing medication and a separate payment for the ingredients 
ingredients produced by multiple manufacturers are reimbursed based on a maximum allowable cost for the ingredient 
ingredients produced by a single manufacturer are reimbursed as a percentage of the average wholesale price 
in certain instances  we contract directly with the sole source manufacturer of an ingredient to receive a rebate  which may vary based upon volumes dispensed during the year 
out of network providers when our members receive services for which we are responsible from a provider outside our network  such as in the case of emergency room services from non contracted hospitals  we generally attempt to negotiate a rate with that provider 
in most cases  when a member is treated by a non contracted provider  we are obligated to pay only the amount that the provider would have received from traditional medicaid or medicare 
sales and marketing programs as of december  and march   our employed sales force consisted of approximately and associates  respectively 
we have developed our sales and marketing programs on a localized basis with a focus on the communities in which our members reside 
we often conduct our sales programs in community settings and in coordination with government agencies 
we regularly participate in local events and organize 
table of contents community health fairs to promote our products and the benefits of preventive care 
we also utilize traditional marketing methods such as direct mail  mass media and cooperative advertising with participating medical groups to generate leads 
consistent with our community focused approach  we employ a culturally diverse sales staff  which allows us to better serve a broader set of beneficiaries  including markets requiring specific language skills and cultural knowledge 
in addition  we have fee for service relationships with independently licensed insurance agents to help us promote our medicare plans in most markets 
our medicaid marketing efforts are heavily regulated by the states in which we operate  each of which imposes different requirements for  or restrictions on  medicaid sales and marketing 
these requirements and restrictions can be revised from time to time 
in addition  local market program design and competitive dynamics affect our sales efforts 
for example  the state of georgia does not permit direct sales by medicaid health plans 
in georgia  we rely primarily on member selection and auto assignment of medicaid members into our plans 
florida also auto assigns medicaid recipients into participating health plans  but historically has permitted direct sales of medicaid plans as well 
however  effective january   the florida agency for health care administration ahca  which oversees the medicaid program  began prohibiting direct sales to medicaid recipients for all plans participating in the florida medicaid program 
primarily as a result of this change  in september we eliminated approximately one hundred positions in florida  most of which were in sales or sales support roles 
our medicare marketing and sales activities are also heavily regulated by cms and the states 
cms has oversight over all  and in some cases has imposed advance approval requirements with respect to  marketing materials used by medicare advantage plans  and our sales activities are limited to activities such as conveying information regarding benefits  describing the operations of managed care plans and providing information about eligibility requirements 
the activities of our independently licensed insurance agents are also covered by cms s regulations 
as stated above  in february  cms notified us that  effective march   we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to medicare beneficiaries and enrollments into all lines of our medicare business 
on july   the medicare improvements for patients and providers act mippa became law and  in september  cms promulgated enabling regulations 
mippa impacts a broad range of medicare marketing activities  including those relating to telemarketing  means of approaching potential members  cross selling of products and compensation 
our marketing efforts for medicare advantage plans historically have focused on direct mail  outbound telemarketing and print advertising initiatives in conjunction with our sales force and our network of independently licensed insurance agents 
however  we modified our use of outbound telemarketing and other medicare marketing practices to comply with mippa 
although we utilized alternative marketing methods during the most recent medicare enrollment period  we are continuing to evaluate and assess how these mippa changes will affect our ability to obtain medicare advantage members and how we will use the most effective alternative marketing methods allowed under mippa to educate potential members regarding our products and services 
in addition  our pdp business also benefits from the auto assignment of members  which is subject to a bid process whereby we submit to cms our estimated costs to provide services in the next fiscal year 
based on our experience  we expect that the number of members auto assigned to us will vary year over year 
for example  as previously described  we bid above the cms benchmark in of the cms regions for plan year and are ineligible to receive auto assigned members in these regions 
as a result   auto assigned dual eligible members were assigned away from our plans and approximately  low income subsidized members disenrolled from our plans in january for further detail regarding restrictions on marketing and sales activities  particularly those to be implemented under the mippa  see part i item business regulation 
quality improvement we continually seek to improve the quality of care delivered by our network providers to our members and our ability to measure the quality of care provided 
our quality improvement program provides the basis for our quality and utilization management functions and outlines specific  ongoing processes and services designed to improve the delivery of quality health care services to our members  as well as to ensure compliance with regulatory and accreditation standards 
each of our health plans has a quality improvement committee  which is comprised of senior members of management  medical directors and other key company associates 
these committees report directly to the health plan board of directors which has oversight responsibilities for the quality of care rendered to our members 
the quality improvement committees also have a number of subcommittees that are charged with monitoring certain aspects of care and service  such as health care utilization  pharmacy services and provider credentialing and recredentialing 
several of our subcommittees include physicians as members 
elements of our quality improvement program include the following evaluation of the effects of particular preventive measures  member satisfaction surveys  grievance and appeals processes for members and providers  orientation visits to  and site audits of  select providers  provider credentialing and recredentialing  ongoing member education programs  ongoing provider education 
table of contents programs  health plan accreditation  and medical record audits 
several of our health plans are also accredited by independent organizations that are designed to promote health care quality 
our florida hmos are accredited by the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc 
our behavioral health subsidiary is accredited by urac formerly known as the utilization review accreditation commission and our georgia hmo was recently accredited by ncqa 
as part of our quality improvement program  at times we have implemented changes to our reimbursement methods to reward those providers who encourage preventive care  such as well child check ups  prenatal care and or adoption of evidence based guidelines for members with chronic conditions 
in addition  we have specialized systems to support our quality improvement activities 
we gather information from our systems to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the services provided to achieve those improvements 
some examples of our intervention programs include a prenatal case management program to help women with high risk pregnancies deliver full term  healthy infants  a program to reduce the number of inappropriate emergency room visits  and a disease management program to decrease the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations 
as previously noted  in april  the board formed the health care quality and access committee 
the principal purpose of this committee is to assist the board by providing general oversight of our policies and procedures governing health care quality and access for our members  which will provide overall direction and guidance to our quality improvement committees 
competition competitive environment 
we operate in a highly competitive environment to manage the cost and quality of services that are delivered to government health care program beneficiaries 
we currently compete in this environment by offering medicaid and medicare health plans in which we accept all or nearly all of the financial risk for management of beneficiary care under these programs 
we typically must be awarded a contract by the government agency with responsibility for a program in order to offer our services in a particular location 
some government programs choose to limit the number of plans that may offer services to beneficiaries  while other agencies allow an unlimited number of plans to serve a program  subject to each plan meeting certain contract requirements 
when the number of plans participating in a program is limited  an agency generally employs a bidding process to select the participating plans 
as a result  the number of companies with whom we compete varies significantly depending on the geographic market  business segment and line of business 
for example  in florida  the medicaid program does not specifically restrict the number of participating plans 
in contrast  the georgia families and peachcare program awards contracts to just three plans 
we currently compete with one or two other plans in each of the six regions in georgia 
likewise  in our medicare business  the number of competitors varies significantly by geography 
in most cases  there are numerous other ccp  pffs and pdp plans and other competitors 
we believe a number of our competitors in both medicare and medicaid have strengths that may match or exceed our own with respect to one or more of the criteria on which we compete with them 
further  some of our competitors may be better positioned than us to withstand rate compression 
competitive factors program participation 
regardless of whether the number of health plans serving a program is limited  we believe government agencies determine program participation based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include the terms of the bids as well as the breadth and depth of a plan s provider network  quality and utilization management processes  responsiveness to member complaints and grievances  timeliness and accuracy of claims payment  financial resources  historical contractual and regulatory compliance  references and accreditation  and other factors 
competitive factors network providers 
in addition  we compete with other health plans to contract with hospitals  physicians  pharmacies and other providers for inclusion in our networks that serve government program beneficiaries 
we believe providers select plans in which they participate based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include reimbursement rates  timeliness and accuracy of claims payment  potential to deliver new patient volume and or retain existing patients  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints  and other factors 
auto assignment 
when establishing a contract  the agency with responsibility for the program determines the approach by which a beneficiary becomes a member of one of the plans serving the program 
generally  a government program uses either automatic assignment of members or permits marketing to members by a plan  though some programs employ both approaches 
some programs assign members to a plan automatically based on predetermined criteria 
these criteria frequently are based on a plan s rates  the outcome of a bidding process  or similar factors 
for example  we receive auto assignment of pdp members based on 
table of contents whether our bids during the annual renewal process are above or below the cms benchmark 
in most states  our medicaid health plans also benefit from auto assignment of individuals who do not choose a plan upfront but are mandatory participants in managed care programs 
each state differs in their approach to auto assignment  but may use some of the following criteria in their auto assignment algorithms a medicaid beneficiary s previous enrollment with a health plan or experience with a particular provider contracted with a health plan  enrolling family members in the same plan  a plan s quality or performance status  a plan s network and enrollment size  awarding all auto assignments to a plan with the lowest bid in a county or region  and equal assignment of non choosers across all plans in a specified county or region 
for more information about how we obtain our members  see part i item business sales and marketing programs 
marketing 
other government programs permit plan sponsors to market their plans to beneficiaries  resulting in ongoing competition among the plans to enroll members 
we believe a beneficiary selects a plan for membership based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include a plan s premiums and cost sharing terms  provider network composition  benefits and medical services  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints  and other factors 
medicaid segment competitors 
in the medicaid managed care market  our principal competitors for state contracts  members and providers include the following types of organizations mcos 
managed care organizations mcos that  like us  receive state funding to provide medicaid benefits to members 
many of these competitors operate in a single or small number of geographic locations 
there are a few multi state medicaid only organizations that tend to be larger in size and therefore are able to leverage their infrastructure over a larger membership base 
competitors include private and public companies  which can be either for profit or non profit organizations  with varying degrees of focus on serving medicaid populations 
medicaid fee for service 
traditional medicaid offered directly by the states or a modified version whereby the state administers a primary care case management model 
medicare segment competitors 
in the medicare market  our primary competitors for contracts  members and providers include the following types of competitors original fee for service medicare 
original medicare is available nationally and is a fee for service plan managed by the federal government 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can go to any doctor  supplier  hospital or other facility that accepts medicare and is accepting new medicare patients 
medicare advantage and prescription drug plans 
medicare advantage and stand alone part d plans are offered by national  regional and local mcos that serve medicare beneficiaries 
employer sponsored coverage 
employers and unions may subsidize medicare benefits for their retirees in their commercial group 
the group sponsor solicits proposals from medicare advantage plans and may select an hmo  ppo  pffs and or pdp plan 
medicare supplements 
original medicare pays for many  but not all  health care services and supplies 
a medicare supplement policy is private health insurance designed to supplement original medicare by covering the cost of items such as co payments  coinsurance and deductibles 
some medicare supplements cover extra benefits for an additional cost 
medicare supplement plans can be used to cover costs not otherwise covered by original medicare  but cannot be used to supplement medicare advantage plans 
regulation our health care operations are highly regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws  statutes  regulations and rules occur frequently 
to offer medicare and medicaid hmo coverage  we must apply for and obtain a certificate of authority or license from each state in which we intend to operate 
as of december   our health plans were licensed to operate as hmos in florida  new york  connecticut  illinois  indiana  georgia  new jersey  ohio  louisiana  texas and missouri 
to offer medicare pffs or ppo coverage  we must be licensed under state law as a risk bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each state in which the organization wishes to offer pffs or ppo plans 
we have three 
table of contents subsidiaries licensed as health indemnity insurers in the states and the district of columbia in which we offer pffs or ppo plans as of march  we also offer our hawaii plans through one of these health indemnity insurers 
to offer medicare prescription drug coverage  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma generally requires pdp sponsors to be licensed under state law as a risk bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each state in which the sponsor wishes to offer a pdp 
however  cms has implemented a waiver process to allow pdp sponsors to operate prior to obtaining state licensure if  among other reasons  the state has not acted on a sponsor s application within a reasonable period of time or does not have a pdp licensing process available to a sponsor 
the entities through which we offer our pdp plans are currently licensed in states plus the district of columbia as of march  in the remaining states  we operate under one of the previously mentioned cms waivers or other arrangements  which are approved through december as hmos and insurance companies  our business is regulated by both the state insurance departments and  in some cases in respect of our hmos  another state agency with responsibility for oversight of hmos 
generally  the licensing requirements are the same for us as they are for commercial managed health care organizations 
we generally must demonstrate to the state that  among other things we have an adequate provider network  our quality and utilization management processes comply with state requirements  we have procedures in place for responding to member and provider complaints and grievances  our systems are capable of processing providers claims in a timely fashion and for collecting and analyzing the information needed to manage our business  our management is competent and trustworthy  we comply with the state s sales and marketing regulations  and we have the financial resources necessary to pay our anticipated medical care expenses and the infrastructure needed to account for our costs 
state regulation and required statutory capital though generally governed by federal law  each of our regulated subsidiaries  including our hmo and insurance subsidiaries  is licensed in the markets in which it operates and is subject to the rules and regulations of  and oversight by  the applicable state department of insurance doi in the areas of licensing and solvency 
each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed 
these reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and business operations 
from time to time  any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits  examinations or reviews by the applicable state to review our operational and financial assertions 
our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from  or provide notice to  the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds or paying dividends to a related party  entering into other arrangements with related parties  and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an hmo or insurance company  or any other change in control 
for purposes of these laws  in general  control commonly is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity 
each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum statutory net worth in an amount determined by statute or regulation and we may only invest in types of investments approved by the state 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  a statutory minimum or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  and are administered by the states 
as of december   our connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri  ohio and pffs operations were subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized company action level  or cal  which represents the amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states 
table of contents in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of the required cal or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum net worth changes over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
for example  new york enacted regulations that increase the reserve requirement by over an eight year period 
in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members 
for instance  because the georgia medicaid program is still new  all plans operating in georgia are required to maintain required statutory capital at an rbc level of of cal 
moreover  as we expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  such as our pffs products  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
each of our operating subsidiaries is required to be licensed by each of the states in which it conducts business 
each insurance company is licensed and regulated by the doi in its domestic state as well as the doi in each other state  commonly referred to as foreign jurisdiction  in which it operates 
for example  two of our insurance companies that offer our pffs products are licensed as domestic insurance companies in arizona and illinois and operate as foreign insurers in between and other states plus the district of columbia 
further  each of our hmos is licensed by the doi in its domestic state as well as the department of health  or similar agency 
in addition  our medicaid and s chip activities are regulated by each state s medicaid  s chip or equivalent agency  and our medicare activities are regulated by cms 
these agencies typically require demonstration of the same capabilities mentioned above and perform periodic audits of performance  usually annually 
state enforcement authorities  including state attorneys general and medicaid fraud control units  have become increasingly active in recent years in their review and scrutiny of various sectors of the health care industry  including health insurers and managed care organizations 
we routinely respond to subpoenas and requests for information from these entities and  more generally  we endeavor to cooperate fully with all government agencies that regulate our business 
for a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings  see part i item legal proceedings 
medicaid as previously described  medicaid  which was established under the us social security act of  is state operated and implemented  although it is funded by both the state and federal governments 
within broad guidelines established by the federal government  each state establishes its own eligibility standards  determines the type  amount  duration and scope of services  sets the rate of payment for services  and administers its own program 
some of the states in which we operate award contracts to applicants that can demonstrate that they meet the state s requirements 
other states engage in a competitive bidding process for all or certain programs 
we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the state medicaid program that we are able to meet the state s operational and financial requirements 
these requirements are in addition to those required for a license and are targeted to the specific needs of the medicaid population 
for example we must measure provider access and availability in terms of the time needed for a member to reach the doctor s office  our quality improvement programs must emphasize member education and outreach and include measures designed to promote utilization of preventive services  we must have linkages with schools  city or county health departments  and other community based providers of health care  in order to demonstrate our ability to coordinate all of the sources from which our members may receive care  
table of contents we must have the capability to meet the needs of disabled members  our providers and member service representatives must be able to communicate with members who do not speak english or who are hearing impaired  and our member handbook  newsletters and other communications must be written at the prescribed reading level and must be available in languages other than english 
in addition  we must demonstrate that we have the systems required to process enrollment information  report on care and services provided and process claims for payment in a timely fashion 
we must also have adequate financial resources to protect the state  our providers and our members against the risk of our insolvency 
once awarded  our medicaid government contracts generally have terms of one to four years 
most of these contracts provide for renewal upon mutual agreement of the parties and both parties have certain early termination rights 
in addition to the operating requirements listed above  state contract requirements and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth detailed provisions relating to subcontractors  marketing  safeguarding of member information  fraud and abuse reporting and grievance procedures 
our medicaid plans are subject to periodic financial and informational reporting and comprehensive quality assurance evaluations 
we regularly submit periodic utilization reports  operations reports and other information to the appropriate medicaid program regulatory agencies 
medicare medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital  medical insurance and prescription drug benefits 
medicare beneficiaries have the option to enroll in a medicare advantage plan  such as a ccp  pffs or ppo benefit plan  in areas where such a plan is offered 
under medicare advantage  managed care plans contract with cms to provide benefits that are comparable to  or that may be more attractive to medicare beneficiaries than  an original medicare plan in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member that varies based on the county in which a member resides  the demographics of the member and the member s health condition 
the mma made numerous changes to the medicare program  including expanding the medicare program to include a prescription drug benefit 
since  medicare beneficiaries have had the option of selecting the new prescription drug benefit from an existing medicare advantage plan or through a stand alone pdp 
the drug benefit  available to beneficiaries for a monthly premium  is subject to certain cost sharing depending upon the specific benefit design of the selected plan 
plans are not required to offer the same benefits  but are required to provide coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to the standard drug coverage delineated in the mma 
along with other part d plans  including pdps and medicare advantage plans that offer a part d benefit  or ma pd  we bid on the part d benefits in june of each year 
based on the bids submitted  cms establishes a national benchmark 
cms pays the part d plans a percentage of the benchmark on a pmpm basis with the remaining portion of the premium being paid by the medicare member 
members whose income falls below of the federal poverty level qualified for the federal low income subsidy  through which the federal government helps pay the member s part d premium and certain other cost sharing expenses 
on july   mippa became law and  in september  cms promulgated enabling regulations 
mippa impacts a broad range of medicare activities and impacts all types of medicare managed care plans 
the following are some of the requirements under mippa which will impact our business pffs plans mippa revises requirements for medicare advantage pffs plans  which may have the effect of ending some of these plans in plan year where such plans are not able to comply with these new requirements 
in particular  mippa requires all pffs plans that operate in markets with two or more networked based plans must be offered on a networked basis 
currently  we do not have provider networks in the majority of the markets where we offer pffs plans 
we are currently evaluating alternative solutions to establishing a network in targeted areas to meet these requirements  including building a contracted network  contracting with a third party network or withdrawing from certain counties where it is not economically or otherwise feasible to establish networks for this line of business 
sales and marketing mippa places prohibitions and limitations on specified sales and marketing activities under medicare advantage and prescription drug plans 
among other things  medicare plans are no longer permitted to make unsolicited contact with potential members by way of outbound telemarketing and community marketing  offer other types of medicare products to existing members  provide meals to potential enrollees or approach potential members in common or public 
table of contents areas 
these changes are likely to increase our administrative costs of enrolling an individual  and could increase the risk of compliance violations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enroll new medicare members particularly because we have historically relied to a large extent on outbound telemarketing and community marketing to sell our products 
although we utilized alternative marketing methods during the most recent medicare enrollment period  we are continuing to evaluate and assess how these mippa changes will affect our continued ability to obtain medicare advantage members and how we will use the most effective alternative marketing methods allowed under mippa to educate potential members regarding our products and services 
special needs plans a significant portion of our coordinated care plan membership is enrolled in our d snps 
under mippa  d snps such as ours are required to contract with state medicaid agencies to coordinate benefits 
the scope of the d snp contract with the state medicaid agency will depend greatly on what eligibility categories  cost sharing responsibilities and payment limitations each state has included in its state plan 
the contracting process under mippa provides an opportunity for d snps and states to improve the coordination of benefits  including defining the overlap between medicaid and medicare benefits  eligibility verification processes  payment and coverage responsibilities  marketing and enrollment standards  appeals and grievances procedures and other important operational considerations 
collaboration between states and d snps is expected to create administrative efficiencies and improve beneficiary health outcomes 
however  the requirement to contract with state medicaid agencies imposes potential risk for d snp providers such as us because mippa does not allow expansion in or continued operation of a d snp after if a state and the d snp provider cannot come to agreement on terms 
compensation mippa also establishes limits on agent and broker compensation 
the cms implementing regulations require that plans that pay commissions do so by paying for an initial year commission and residual commissions for each of the five subsequent renewal years  thereby creating a six year commission cycle for members moving from original medicare and a five year commission cycle for members moving from another medicare advantage plan 
s chip programs s chip is a health insurance program that is funded jointly by the federal government and states that is designed to help states expand health insurance coverage to children whose families earn too much to qualify for traditional medicaid  yet not enough to afford private health insurance 
states have the option of administering s chip through their existing medicaid programs  creating separate programs  or combining both strategies 
currently  all states  the district of columbia and all us territories have approved s chip or similar plans  and many states continue to submit plan amendments to further expand coverage under s chip 
in january  the us congress approved the children s health bill which  among things  reauthorizes and increases federal funding to s chip 
hipaa and state privacy laws in  congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and thereafter  the secretary of health and human services issued regulations implementing hipaa 
hipaa is intended to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims and related transactions 
all health plans  including ours  are subject to hipaa 
hipaa generally requires health plans to protect the privacy and security of patient health information through the implementation of appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards  and establish the capability to receive and transmit electronically certain administrative health care transactions  such as claims payments  in a standardized format 
we are also subject to state laws that are not preempted by hipaa  including those that provide for greater privacy of individuals health information 
fraud and abuse laws federal and state enforcement authorities have prioritized the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud  waste and abuse 
fraud  waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of operating activities  including kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products such as prescription drugs by a plan  billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider  improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights 
companies involved in public health care programs such as medicaid and medicare are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud  waste and abuse  and are often the subject of fraud  waste and abuse investigations and audits 
the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in 
table of contents these public sector programs are complex and subject to change 
for example  the new medicare part d benefit is likely to lead to increased scrutiny by enforcement officials of managed care providers operating pdp plans and ma pd plans 
although we believe that we have structured our compliance program with care in an effort to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements  we are continuing to improve our education and training programs  and we expect to invest significant resources to enhance our compliance efforts 
federal and state laws and regulations governing submission of information and claims to agencies we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that apply to the submission of information and claims to various agencies 
for example  the federal false claims act provides  in part  that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person or entity who it believes has knowingly presented  or caused to be presented  a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government  or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved 
the federal government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti kickback statute may be considered a violation of the federal false claims act 
violations of the false claims act are punishable by treble damages and penalties of up to a specified dollar amount per false claim 
in addition  a special provision under the false claims act allows a private person for example  a whistleblower such as a disgruntled former associate  competitor or member to bring an action under the false claims act on behalf of the government alleging that an entity has defrauded the federal government and permits the private person to share in any settlement of  or judgment entered in  the lawsuit 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted false claims acts  as well as their own laws whereby  under certain conditions  a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court on behalf of the state government 
marketing our medicaid marketing efforts are highly regulated by the states in which we operate and cms  each of which imposes different requirements and restrictions on medicaid marketing 
in general  the states can impose a variety of sanctions for marketing violations  including fines  a suspension of marketing and or a suspension of new enrollment 
for more information about our marketing programs  see part i item business sales and marketing programs 
the marketing activities of medicare managed care plans are strictly regulated by cms 
cms must approve all marketing materials before they can be used 
while current federal law preempts state law except with respect to licensure and solvency requirements  the mippa and cms proposed rules will require additional coordination among health plans  states and cms 
for example  in order for us to be able to continue to offer d snps for those who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid after  we will have to negotiate contracts with all applicable state medicaid agencies 
for more information about regulations governing our marketing activities  see part i item business regulation medicare 
technology a foundation of providing managed care services is the accurate and timely capture  processing and analysis of critical data 
focusing on data is essential to operating our business in a cost effective manner 
data processing and data driven decision making are key components of both administrative efficiency and medical cost management 
we use our information system for premium billing  claims processing  utilization management  reporting  medical cost trending  planning and analysis 
the system also supports member and provider service functions  including enrollment  member eligibility verification  primary care and specialist physician roster access  claims status inquiries  and referrals and authorizations 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the ability of our existing operations to support our current and future business needs and to maintain our compliance requirements 
this evaluation may result in enhancing or replacing current systems and or processes which could result in our incurring substantial costs to improve our operations and services 
we have a disaster recovery plan that addresses how we recover to an acceptable level of business functionality within stated timelines 
due to ongoing document retention requirements  our ability to recover all business functionality in a timely manner may be impaired 
we have a cold site and business recovery site agreement with a nationally recognized third party vendor to provide for the restoration of our general support systems at a remote processing center 
in  we successfully performed our annual disaster recovery testing for critical business applications defined in our plan 
employees we refer to our employees as associates 
as of december   we had approximately  full time associates

in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  targets  predicts  potential  continues or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology 
you are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including economic  regulatory  competitive and other factors that may affect our business 
these forward looking statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances  as they are based on management s current expectations and beliefs about future events and circumstances 
we undertake no obligation beyond that required by law to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements as a result of various important factors including the expiration  cancellation or suspension of our state and federal contracts 
in addition  our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend  in large part  on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses 
a variety of factors  including competition  changes in health care practices  changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations  inflation  provider contract changes  changes in or terminations of our contracts with government agencies  new technologies  government imposed surcharges  taxes or assessments  reduction in provider payments by governmental payors  major epidemics  disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of health care  such as major health care providers inability to maintain their operations  may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses 
governmental action or business conditions could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other operating expenses 
once set  premiums are generally fixed for one year periods and  accordingly  unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums 
furthermore  if we are unable to estimate accurately incurred but not reported medical costs in the current period  our future profitability may be affected 
due to these factors and risks  we cannot provide any assurance regarding our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 
from time to time  at the federal and state government levels  legislative and regulatory proposals have been made related to  or potentially affecting  the health care industry  including but not limited to limitations on managed care organizations  including benefit mandates  and reform of the medicaid and medicare programs 
any such legislative and regulatory action  including benefit mandates and reform of the medicaid and medicare programs  could have the effect of reducing the premiums paid to us by governmental programs  increasing our medical or administrative costs or requiring us to materially alter the manner in which we operate

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following factors  together with all the other information included in this report  in evaluating our company and our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and the value of our stock could decline 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
as such  you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
risks related to pending governmental investigations and litigation any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by certain federal and state agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are currently under investigation by federal and state authorities  including ahca  the us attorney s office for the middle district of florida the usao  the civil division of the us department of justice the civil division  the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services the oig and the florida attorney general s medicaid fraud control unit mfcu 
pursuant to an agreement dated august  with ahca  the usao and mfcu  two of our subsidiaries  wellcare of florida  inc and healthease of florida  inc together  the wellcare florida hmos  agreed to transmit 
table of contents million the transmitted amount to the financial litigation unit of the usao 
the transmitted amount was based on our best estimate  as of the effective date of the agreement  of the total potential amount of medicaid behavioral health capitation refunds that the wellcare florida hmos owe or may owe to ahca for calendar years through  but did not include any interest  fines  penalties or other assessments that may be imposed against us 
of the total transmitted amount  we acknowledged and agreed that the wellcare florida hmos would make payment of not less than a total amount of million  and therefore we authorized the usao  ahca and mfcu to access and distribute the million to the appropriate federal and state agencies in accordance with applicable federal and state law 
in addition  the parties to the agreement acknowledged and agreed that million of the transmitted amount would be held in an escrow account pending resolution of all federal and related state claims by the united states or the state of florida for monetary damages or other financial impositions of any kind arising from  or related to  the investigation by mfcu or the usao 
the amount held in escrow does not limit in any way the ability of federal or state authorities to recover additional amounts  including interest  civil or criminal fines  penalties or other assessments that may be imposed against us  and we cannot make any assurances that the federal or state authorities will not seek or be entitled to recover amounts in excess of the escrowed amounts 
the agreement did not  nor should it be construed to  operate as a settlement or release of any criminal  civil or administrative claims for monetary  injunctive or other relief against us  whether under federal  state or local statutes  regulations or common law 
furthermore  the agreement does not operate  nor should it be construed  as a concession that we are entitled to any limitation of our potential federal  state or local civil or criminal liability 
we are engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the usao  the civil division  the oig and the state of florida 
any resolution of the ongoing investigations being conducted by certain federal and state agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  in the year ended december  we recorded selling  general and administrative expense and accrued a liability in the amount of million in connection with the resolution of these matters  which is included in the other accrued expenses item within our consolidated balance sheets as of december   and  respectively 
we believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have already been reflected in our financial statements  however  we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the usao  the civil division  the oig or the state of florida 
we have responded to subpoenas issued by the state of connecticut attorney general s office involving transactions between us and our affiliates and their potential impact on the costs of connecticut s medicaid program 
in addition  the sec is conducting an informal investigation 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  any pending investigations will result in the imposition of operating restrictions on our business 
if we were to plead guilty to or be convicted of a health care related charge  potential adverse consequences could include revocation of our licenses  termination of one or more of our contracts and or exclusion from further participation in medicare or medicaid programs 
in addition  we could be required to operate under a corporate integrity agreement or under the supervision of a monitor  either of which could require us to operate under significant restrictions  place substantial burdens on our management  hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates and cause us to incur significant costs 
further  the majority of our contracts pursuant to which we provide medicare and medicaid services contain provisions that grant the regulator broad authority to terminate at will contracts with any entity affiliated with a convicted entity or for other reasons 
any such outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the pendency of these investigations as well as the litigation described below could also impair our ability to raise additional capital  which may be needed to pay any resulting interest  civil or criminal fines  penalties or other assessments 
we and certain of our past officers and directors are defendants in litigation relating to our participation in federal health care programs  accounting practices and other related matters  and the outcome of these lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
putative class action complaints were filed against us  as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors on october  and on november   alleging  among other things  numerous violations of securities laws 
subsequent developments in these cases are described below in part i item legal proceedings 
in addition  five putative shareholder derivative actions were filed between october  and november  all five actions contend  among other things  that the defendants allegedly allowed or caused us to misrepresent our reported financial results  in amounts unspecified in the pleadings  and seek damages and equitable relief for  among other things  the defendants supposed breach of fiduciary duty  waste and unjust enrichment 
subsequent developments in these cases are described below in part i item legal proceedings 
in addition  in a letter dated october   the civil division informed counsel to the special committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry  the civil division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the false claims act  usc sections the seal in those cases has been partially lifted for 
table of contents the purpose of authorizing the civil division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints 
the complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by usc section b 
we and the special committee are undertaking to discuss with the civil division  and address  allegations by the qui tam relators 
we also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on october  in state court for leon county  florida against several defendants  including us and one of our subsidiaries 
because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing  we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and  therefore  we do not know whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations 
it is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the false claims act  or similar state statutes  based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this form k 
at this time  we cannot predict the probable outcome of these claims 
these and other potential actions that may be filed against us  whether with or without merit  may divert the attention of management from our business  harm our reputation and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for a discussion of the aforementioned proceedings  see part i item legal proceedings 
our indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
under delaware law  our charter and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party  we have an obligation to indemnify  or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify  certain of our current and former directors  officers and associates with respect to current and future investigations and litigation  including the matters discussed in part i item legal proceedings 
in connection with some of these pending matters  we are required to  or we have otherwise agreed to  advance  and have advanced  significant legal fees and related expenses to several of our current and former directors  officers and associates and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending 
certain of these obligations may not be covered matters under our directors and officers liability insurance  or there may be insufficient coverage available 
further  in the event the directors  officers and associates are ultimately determined to not be entitled to indemnification  we may not be able to recover the amounts we previously advanced to them 
in addition  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with the pending investigations and litigation 
we maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amounts of million for indemnifiable claims and million for non indemnifiable securities claims 
we have met the retention limits under these policies 
we also maintain insurance in the amount of million which provides coverage for our independent directors and officers hired after january  for certain potential matters to the extent they occur after october we cannot provide any assurances that pending claims  or claims yet to arise  will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies  that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims 
due to these insurance coverage limitations  we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification and other obligations  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
as a result of the ongoing federal and state investigations  shareholder and derivative litigation  restatement of our previously issued financial statements and related matters  we have been the subject of negative publicity 
this negative publicity may harm our relationships with current and future investors  government regulators  associates  members  vendors and providers 
for example  it is possible that the negative publicity and its effect on our work environment could cause our associates to terminate their employment or  if they remain employed by us  result in reduced morale that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and  therefore  associates and prospective associates may also consider our stability and the value of any equity incentives when making decisions regarding employment opportunities 
additionally  negative publicity may adversely affect our reputation  which could harm our ability to obtain new membership  building or maintaining our network of providers  or business in the future 
for example  when making award determinations  states frequently consider the plan s historical regulatory compliance and reputation 
as a result  continuing negative publicity regarding the investigations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the investigations and related matters have diverted  and are expected to continue to divert  management s attention  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition to the challenges of the various government investigations and extensive litigation we face  our management team has spent considerable time and effort with regard to the internal and external investigations involving our historical accounting practices 
table of contents and internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures 
in particular  our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and general counsel  as well as senior members of our finance and legal departments  have spent considerable time and effort with regard to the investigations  the restatement and related matters 
the significant time and effort spent by our management team on these matters has diverted  and is expected to continue to divert  its attention  which has  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our business we have expended  and expect to continue to expend  significant financial resources as a result of the government and special committee investigations  which will reduce our cash available to meet statutory reserve requirements  debt service payments and other corporate obligations for our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
through december   we had incurred a total of approximately million in administrative expenses associated with  or consequential to  the government and special committee investigations  including legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  employee recruitment and retention costs and similar expenses 
approximately million of these investigation related costs were incurred in we expect to continue incurring significant additional costs as a result of the federal and state investigations and pending civil actions  including administrative expenses similar to those discussed above  and costs necessary to improve our corporate governance and address other issues that were identified through the restatement and remediation processes 
we may also be required to pay significant damages or other amounts in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement 
a substantial amount of these costs will not be covered by  or may exceed the limits of  our insurance 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  such payments may limit cash available for our operations and could impair our ability to meet certain statutory capital reserve requirements 
further  if we cannot obtain additional financing  our cash generated by operations may not be sufficient to meet these obligations 
we are engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the usao  the civil division  the oig and the state of florida 
based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  in the year ended december  we recorded selling  general and administrative expense and accrued a liability in the amount of million in connection with the resolution of these matters  which is included in the other accrued expenses line item within our consolidated balance sheets as of december   and  respectively 
we believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have already been reflected in our financial statements  however  we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the usao  the civil division  the oig or the state of florida 
if we were required to pay a significant amount as restitution and or a fine or penalty in the near term as part of any resolution  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
for more information related to this accrual  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
if we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in future periods  it could require us to incur substantial costs and divert management resources in connection with our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses and to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  specifically  we concluded that a former senior management set an inappropriate tone in connection with the company s efforts to comply with the regulatory requirements related to certain medicaid contracts that led to a deficiency in the design in our internal controls  and therefore a material weakness existed in a portion of the control environment and control activities components of our internal controls  and b former senior management s failure to ensure effective communications regarding certain medicaid contracts with  among others  our board and certain regulators resulted in a material weakness in the information and communication system 
solely as a result of the material weaknesses described above  our management also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we have taken or intend to take will ensure that we design  implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future and  accordingly  additional material weaknesses may occur in the future 
it is possible that additional control deficiencies may be identified in addition to  or that are unrelated to  our review of the work of the special committee 
these control deficiencies may represent one or more material weaknesses 
our inability to remedy any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future could  among other things  cause us to fail to file timely our periodic reports with the sec  result in the need to further restate our historical financial statements  prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial information and forecasts or from avoiding or detecting fraud  or require us to incur additional costs or divert management resources to  among other things  comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents if our government contracts are not renewed or are renewed on substantially different terms  are terminated or become subject to an enrollment or marketing freeze  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we provide our medicaid  medicare  s chip and other services through a limited number of contracts with state  federal or local government agencies 
these contracts generally have terms of one to four years and are subject to non renewal by the applicable government agency 
all of our government contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations 
our federal and state government contracts are generally subject to cancellation  non renewal or a potential freeze on marketing or enrollment in the event of the unavailability of adequate program funding  compliance violations or for other reasons 
in some jurisdictions  a cancellation or enrollment freeze may be immediate  while in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
for example  during  we were subject to a day medicaid marketing freeze in three counties in florida resulting from the state s allegation of wrongful marketing practices 
further  in february  cms notified us that  effective march   we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to medicare beneficiaries and enrollments into all lines of our medicare business 
this suspension will remain in effect until cms has determined that the suspension should be lifted 
at this time  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the duration of the suspension and are evaluating the impact that it could have on our results of operations and our business 
nonetheless  we anticipate that our inability to perform marketing activities to  or enroll new medicare members  as well as any actions that we take in response to the sanction  will have a material negative affect on our results of operations and business in and potentially beyond 
further  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to take appropriate corrective action or that  despite any corrective measures taken on our part  that we will not incur additional penalties  fines or other operating restrictions which could have an additional material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in response to the cms suspension in march  we have made certain changes to our medicare marketing sales force and are continuing to assess the impact of ceasing marketing activities and the resulting loss of membership to determine what effect  if any  this action will have on our staffing needs and other operational capabilities to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the members we serve 
some of our contracts are also subject to termination or are only eligible for renewal through annual competitive bidding processes 
for example  renewal of our pdp business is subject to an annual bidding process 
as previously described  we bid above the cms benchmark in of the cms regions for plan year and are ineligible to receive auto assigned members in these regions 
as a result   auto assigned dual eligible members were assigned away from our plans and approximately  low income subsidized members disenrolled from our plans in january if we are unable to renew or to rebid or compete successfully for any of our existing or potential government contracts  if any of our contracts are terminated  or if any limitations or restrictions are imposed  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and ability to bid for  and continue to participate in  certain programs 
we use administrative  claim and clinical data  known as encounter data  to identify members who may benefit from preventive or increased coordination of care or who otherwise need to maintain health status in association with a chronic condition or complex clinical situation 
this data may also be aggregated and shared with specific health care providers to determine the effectiveness of care delivered to our members 
we are required to report encounter data to our regulators who use the data to monitor what services we provide to our members  determine if services are being under or over utilized and evaluate the quality of the services we provide 
to do so  our regulators compare our encounter data to certain defined quality metrics such as the health effectiveness data and information set hedis or unique metrics defined by the particular regulator 
our regulators may also use our encounter data  as well as data submitted by other health plans  to set reimbursement rates  assign membership  assess the quality of care being provided to members and evaluate contractual and regulatory compliance 
for example  new york uses encounter data to measure and rate the quality of services health plans offer 
plans that score well on the quality measures as well as certain other performance standards are rewarded with additional premiums and auto assigned members 
plans that fail to meet the standards for this additional premium and auto assigned members  including established quality measures  for three consecutive years could be excluded from participation in the new york medicaid program 
further  florida has indicated a desire to implement a quality based auto assignment program by september the formula used to determine health plan assignment may utilize  in part  encounter data submissions 
failure by our providers to submit key data elements or to conform their submissions to required formats results in deficiencies in our encounter data 
we are currently working closely with several states to ascertain or improve the accuracy or completeness of our encounter data 
where we have inaccurate or incomplete encounter data  we are required to expend additional effort to collect or correct this data and we are exposed to regulatory risk for noncompliance 
we expect states to increase their reliance on encounter 
table of contents data 
our inability to obtain  or submit in a timely manner  complete and accurate encounter data could significantly affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and ability to bid for  and continue to participate in  certain programs 
our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable are subject to greater variability when there is more limited claims payment experience or information available to us  which could cause our reported results of operations to be materially different than expected 
the factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited claims payment experience or information available to us 
for example  from to  we grew at a rapid pace  through the expansion of existing products and introduction of new products  such as part d and pffs  and entry into new geographic areas  such as georgia 
the ultimate claims payment amounts  patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas can not be precisely predicted at their onset  since we  the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas 
standard accepted actuarial methodologies require the use of key assumptions consisting of trend and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions that would allow for this inherent variability 
this can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid 
medical cost trends can be volatile and management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
actual conditions  however  could differ from those assumed in the estimation process 
due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in the assumptions discussed above  the actual amount of medical benefits expense that we incur may be materially different than the amount of medical benefits payable originally estimated 
if our estimates of medical benefits payable are inaccurate in the future  our reported results of operations could be favorably or unfavorably impacted 
further  our inability to estimate medical benefits payable accurately may also materially adversely affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further exacerbating the extent of any material adverse effect on our results of operations 
factors that may cause medical benefits expense to exceed our estimates include  among others lack of experience estimating medical benefits expense for new products and or in new geographic areas  an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  whether as a result of inflation or otherwise  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiation of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of catastrophes  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  new mandated benefits or other changes in health care laws  regulations and or practices  and unanticipated adverse selection by high cost members 
we manage our medical benefits expense through a variety of techniques  including various payment methods to primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements  medical management and quality management programs  upgraded information systems and reinsurance arrangements 
however  we may not be able to manage these expenses effectively in the future 
for example  a hypothetical increase in our medical benefits ratio mbr  the ratio of our medical expenses to the premiums we receive and a measure of our profitability  would have reduced our earnings before income taxes for the years ended december  and by approximately million and million  respectively 
if our medical benefits expense increases  our profitability and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we derive a large portion of our medicaid revenues and profits from operations in florida and georgia  and legislative or regulatory actions  economic conditions or other factors that materially adversely affect those operations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
for the year ended december   our florida and georgia medicaid health plans accounted for approximately and of our total medicaid segment premium revenues  respectively 
if we are unable to continue to operate in florida and georgia  
table of contents if our current operations in florida and georgia are significantly curtailed  or either florida or georgia are unable or unwilling to pay current rates for medicaid health plans  our revenues and profits will decrease materially 
our reliance on our medicaid operations in florida and georgia could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly  depending on legislative or regulatory actions  economic conditions and similar factors 
for example  in  florida implemented medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to provide services in the medicaid reform programs 
as a result  we notified the state of florida that we were withdrawing from these programs effective july   which will result in a loss of approximately  members 
these recent and possible future rate reductions will require us to evaluate our medical benefits and administrative expenses 
in georgia  managed care legislation enacted on july  has resulted in program changes designed to address issues raised by health care providers during program implementation 
these changes related to payment of claims  eligibility determination and provider contracting  and may negatively impact revenues and profits for the plan 
further  continued economic slowdowns in florida and georgia have negatively impacted state revenues 
consequently  in order to meet state budgetary requirements  florida or georgia or both may develop future medicaid capitation rates that are insufficient to keep pace with our medical trends or inflation  therefore reducing our profitability in those markets and materially adversely affecting our results of operations 
similarly  although the us congress approved the children s health bill which  among things  increases federal funding to the s chip and president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act that provides funding for  among other things  state medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts  because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives  the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how medicaid and s chip funds will be used  we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business 
it is possible that the ultimate impact of these initiatives could be negative 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the managed care industry historically has been subject to negative publicity 
this publicity may result in increased legislation  regulation and review of industry practices and  in some cases  litigation 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and services  require us to change our products and services and increase regulatory or legal burdens under which we operate  further increasing the costs of doing business and materially adversely affecting our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the government agencies that regulate us can impose restrictions on our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability  results of operations and cash flows 
the government agencies that regulate us may limit or impose restrictions on us  or suspend our right to market to or add new members if it finds deficiencies in our provider network or operations  compliance violations or for other reasons 
for example  during  we were subject to a day medicaid marketing freeze in three counties in florida resulting from the state s allegation of wrongful marketing practices 
further  in february  we were notified by cms that  effective march   we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to medicare beneficiaries and enrollments into all lines of our medicare business 
this suspension will remain in effect until cms has determined that it should be lifted 
at this time  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the duration of the suspension and we are evaluating the impact that it could have on our results of operations and our business 
nonetheless  we anticipate that our inability to perform marketing activities to  or enroll new medicare members  as well as any actions that we take in response to the sanction  will have a material negative affect on our results of operations and business in and potentially beyond 
further  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to take appropriate corrective action or that  despite any corrective measures taken on our part  that we will not incur additional penalties  fines or other operating restrictions which could have an additional material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in response to the cms suspension in march  we made certain changes to our medicare marketing sales force and are continuing to assess the impact of suspending marketing activities and the resulting loss of membership to determine what effect  if any  this action will have on our staffing needs and other operational capabilities to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the members we serve 
in addition  a governmental entity may take unilateral action to limit or suspend our ability to enter into additional contracts with that entity in the future  which could constrain our ability to expand our business 
for example  in we terminated our contract with cms to offer ppo plans in georgia and  as a consequence  under the terms of our contract with cms  we are not allowed to re enter georgia to offer ppo plans for a period of two years 
when we enter new markets  regulators may place certain limitations on our license or may impose restrictions or additional requirements on our operations 
for example  the north carolina department of insurance imposed a limitation on the number of pffs members we can enroll until we have operated in the state for a certain amount of time 
further  when we commenced operations in ohio  the ohio department of insurance required us to maintain rbc  which is higher than would be required of a plan that had been operating in the state for a longer period of time 
these limitations and additional requirements can restrict our ability to grow our membership in new markets and may require us to make additional capital contributions to new plans which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability  cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents because our premiums  which generate most of our revenues  are fixed by contract  we are unable to increase our premiums during the contract term if our corresponding medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these payments are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract period  which is generally one to four years  to provide or arrange for the provision of health care services as established by state and federal governments 
we have less control over costs related to the provision of health care services than we do over our selling  general and administrative expense 
historically  our medical benefits expense as a percentage of premium revenue has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band 
for example  our medical benefits expense was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
further  our regulators set premiums using actuarial methods based on historical data 
actual experience  however  could differ from those assumed in the premium setting process  which could result in premiums being insufficient to cover our medical benefits expense 
if our medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates or our regulators actuarial pricing assumptions  we will be unable to adjust the premiums we receive under our current contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in our member mix may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  profitability and results of operations 
our revenues  costs and margins vary based on changes to our membership mix  product mix and the demographics of our membership 
our revenues are generally comprised of fixed payments that are determined by the type of member in our plans 
the payments are generally set based on an estimation of the medical costs required to serve members with various demographic and health risk profiles 
as such  there are sometimes wide variations in the established rates per member in both our medicaid and medicare lines of business 
for instance  the rates we receive for a medicaid abd member are generally significantly higher than for a non abd member who is otherwise similarly situated 
as the result of the previously described cms suspension of marketing of  enrollments into  all lines of our medicare business  we may encounter membership mix changes within our medicare membership which could negatively impact our results of operations 
as the composition of our membership base changes as the result of programmatic  competitive  regulatory  benefit design  economic or other changes  there is a corresponding change to our premium revenue  costs and margins  which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  profitability and results of operations 
our failure to make acquisitions or divestitures on terms favorable to us  or at all  or to successfully integrate the businesses and product lines we acquire  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
in addition to organic growth  acquisitions of other health plans remains an element of our growth strategy 
however  the ongoing turmoil in the credit markets has made obtaining financing very challenging  and we may not have sufficient available cash to finance an acquisition 
therefore  we may be unable to identify  finance and complete appropriate acquisitions 
similarly  our ability to dispose of our assets may be hindered by our inability to find a suitable purchaser as the result of these market conditions  the pendency of the investigations and related matters or other factors 
in addition to general market and financing risks  we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state or federal agencies when acquiring or disposing of a health plan  which may require a public hearing 
we may be unable to comply with the regulatory requirements for an acquisition or disposition in a timely manner  or at all 
even if we identify suitable acquisition targets or purchasers for our assets  we may be unable to complete these types of transactions on terms favorable to us  or at all 
further  if we complete acquisitions  we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions because of operational factors or difficulties in integrating the acquisitions with our existing businesses 
to the extent that we complete acquisitions  we are likely to incur additional costs or administrative challenges associated with entering into geographic areas in which we do not currently operate or expand into new lines of business 
our rate of expansion into other geographic areas or other product lines may also be inhibited by the time and costs associated with obtaining the necessary license to operate in the new geographic area or new line of business  if necessary  our inability to develop a network of physicians  hospitals and other health care providers that meets our requirements and those of government regulators  competition  which can increase the costs of recruiting members  the cost of providing health care services in those geographic areas or lines of business  
table of contents increased administrative and operational efforts and costs consequential to our establishing new operations for  or our inexperience with  a new line of business or geographic area  and demographics and population density 
accordingly  we may be unsuccessful in entering other geographic areas  counties  states or lines of business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
the inability or failure to maintain effective and secure management information systems and applications  successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs could result in operational disruptions and other materially adverse consequences 
our business depends on effective and secure information systems  applications and operations 
the information gathered  processed and stored by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  marketing and sales and membership tracking  underwriting  billing  claims processing  medical management  medical care cost and utilization trending  financial and management accounting  reporting  planning and analysis and e commerce 
these systems also support our customer services functions  provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analysis of medical expenses and outcome data 
these systems remain subject to unexpected interruptions resulting from occurrences such as hardware failures or increased demand 
there can be no assurance that such interruptions will not occur in the future  and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
moreover  operating and other issues can lead to data problems that affect the performance of important functions  including  but not limited to  claims payment  customer service and accurate financial reporting and customer service 
there can also be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems  developing new systems to support our operations and improving service levels will not be delayed or that system issues will not arise in the future 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our systems  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis  loss of members  difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
additionally  events outside our control  including acts of nature such as hurricanes  earthquakes  fires or terrorism  could significantly impair our information systems and applications 
to help ensure continued operations in the event that our primary data center operations are rendered inoperable  we have a disaster recovery plan that addresses how we recover to an acceptable level of business functionality within stated timelines 
due to ongoing document retention requirements  our ability to recover all business functionality in a timely manner may be impaired 
therefore  our disaster plan may not operate effectively during an actual disaster and our operations could be disrupted  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations  or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  fines and penalties  possible liability and loss 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if such breaches are not prevented 
we rely on a number of vendors  and failure of any one of the key vendors to perform in accordance with our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have contracted with a number of vendors to provide significant assistance in our operational support including  but not limited to  certain enrollment  billing  call center  benefit administration  claims processing functions  sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management 
our dependence on these vendors makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under our contracts with them 
significant failure by a vendor to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  due to our growth  business changes or legal proceedings  our ability to manage these vendors may be impacted 
in addition  due to these factors  our vendors may request changes 
table of contents in pricing  payment terms or other contractual obligations between the parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we encounter significant competition for program participation  network providers and members  and our failure to compete successfully may limit our ability to increase or maintain membership in the markets we serve  which may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes due to business consolidations  changes in regulation that could affect competitors differently  new strategic alliances and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations 
we compete principally on the basis of premiums and cost sharing terms  provider network composition  benefits and medical services provided  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints  and other factors 
for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate  see part i item business competition 
a number of these competitive elements are partially dependent on  and can be positively affected  by financial resources available to a health plan 
many other organizations with which we compete have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
competitors with greater financial resources than us may be better positioned than us to withstand rate compression 
further  we operate in or may attempt to acquire business in programs or markets in which premiums are determined on the basis of a competitive bidding process 
in these programs or markets  funding levels established by bidders with significantly different cost structures  target profitability margins or aggressive bidding strategies could negatively impact our ability to maintain or acquire profitable business which could hurt our results of operations 
in addition  regulatory reform or other initiatives may bring additional competitors into our markets 
failure to compete successfully in the markets we serve may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations 
we may not be able to retain or effectively replace our executive officers  other members of management or associates  and the loss of any one or more members of management and their managed care expertise  or large numbers of associates  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although some of our officers have entered into employment agreements with us  these agreements may not provide sufficient incentives for those officers to continue their employment with us 
the loss of the leadership  knowledge and experience of our management teams could have a material adverse effect on our business 
replacing one or more of the members of our management team might be difficult or take an extended period of time 
we may not be able to retain our executive officers  other members of management or associates due to some limitations in our compensation arrangements 
historically  the focus of our compensation program has been on equity awards in the form of restricted stock and stock options 
following the commencement of the governmental investigations in october and the subsequent decline in our stock price  our ability to attract and retain our associates  including our executive officers  whether through equity awards or more generally  became more challenging 
to address our retention issues  among other things  we implemented a retention program that expired at the end of  and a severance program that will terminate at the end of the remaining severance program may not provide sufficient incentives to retain our officers and other associates and we have not established a new severance program to follow after the current program expires in additionally  we have not established a similar retention program to replace the prior program that expired at the end of although we have implemented other programs that are designed to have a retentive affect 
our success is also dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified management  and technical and medical personnel 
the pendency of the ongoing governmental investigations  litigation and related matters and any ongoing restrictions under which we must operate  such as a corporate integrity agreement or third party monitor  could hinder our ability to attract and retain qualified associates 
accordingly  all of these factors may impair our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not expect to sustain the rapid rate of growth we have achieved during the past five years  which could be viewed unfavorably by investors 
over the past five years we have experienced a rapid rate of growth in our business 
we do not foresee growth at the same level of prior years primarily because i we believe that our historic rates of growth are unsustainable  ii at this time we do not foresee large  one time opportunities to expand our business  such as the launch of pdps and the privatization of georgia medicaid  and iii we intend to divert some resources to strengthen our compliance and operating capabilities 
furthermore  pressure on premium rates or margins could lead us to selectively exit some markets or products 
for example  in we withdrew from the ohio abd program and in early we withdrew from the florida medicaid reform counties  in both cases because the premiums we received were insufficient to cover our medical expenses 
finally  recent regulatory changes designed to limit the use of direct and other marketing techniques could cause our rate of membership growth to decline 
accordingly  our business may experience a period of slower growth or contraction in and beyond  which may be viewed unfavorably by investors 
ineffective or unsuccessful management of our growth  either generally or with respect to specific products or geographic areas  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we had total revenue of approximately billion and billion in and  respectively 
management of our past and future potential growth  either generally or with respect to specific products or geographic areas  could place a significant strain on our management team and other resources 
our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to retain and strengthen our management team and attract  train and retain skilled associates  and our ability to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis 
we may need to enhance and augment our current systems and operating environment to ensure system and operational reliability as well as compliance with our current and future contracts 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the initial substantial costs related to growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our providers  we may be precluded from operating in some markets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 
our profitability depends  in large part  on our ability to enter into cost effective contracts with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers in appropriate numbers and at locations convenient for our members in each of the markets in which we operate 
in any particular market  however  providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical benefits expense 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions 
if such a provider or any of our other providers refused to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate contracts that might not be cost effective or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage  those activities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in that market 
also  in some rural areas  it is difficult to maintain a provider network sufficient to meet regulatory requirements 
in the long term  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will affect the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in that market 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating satisfactory contracts with our network providers  it could preclude us from renewing our medicaid or medicare contracts in those markets  from being able to enroll new members or from entering into new markets 
also  in situations where we have a deficiency in our provider network  regulators require us to allow members to obtain care from out of network providers at no additional cost  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage expenses 
our provider contracts with network primary care physicians and specialists generally have terms of one to four years  with automatic renewal for successive one year terms 
we may be unable to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to serve our members profitably 
we are also required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
further  under mippa  we are required to have a network of providers for all of our pffs plans that operate in markets with two or more networked based plans 
currently  we do not have provider networks in the majority of the markets where we offer pffs plans 
we are currently evaluating alternative solutions to establishing a network in targeted areas to meet these requirements  including building a contracted network  contracting with a third party network or withdrawing from certain counties where it is not economically or otherwise feasible to establish networks for this line of business 
however  if we are unable to establish adequate networks  we will be required to cease offering pffs plans in these areas 
finally  we may be unable to maintain our relationships with our network providers or enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our results of operations and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property rights in our brand names for our health plans or enforce such rights may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to market our health plans under our brand names  including wellcare  healthease  staywell  and harmony 
we hold a federal trademark registration for the wellcare trademark  and we are pursuing applications with the us patent and trademark office to register healthease and harmony 
we use the staywell trademark only in the state of florida  and  pursuant to an agreement in august with the staywell company  a health education company based in st 
paul  minnesota  we will co exist with their use of that term for very different kinds of services and will not pursue a federal registration of that trademark 
it is possible that other businesses may have actual or purported rights in the same names or similar names to those under which we market our health plans  which could limit or prevent our ability to use these names  or our ability to prevent others from using these names 
if we are unable to prevent others from using our brand names  if others prohibit us from using such names or if we incur significant costs to protect our intellectual property rights in such brand names  our business  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
several members of our management team have been recently appointed to their positions  and a lack of familiarity with our company or our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
during the past year  our management team has undergone a number of changes  including the appointment of several members of senior management  some of whom have limited prior experience with our company or our industry 
our operations are highly 
table of contents dependent on the experience and skills of our management team 
our new management s team overall lack of familiarity and experience with the company or our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure of our state regulators to approve payments of dividends and or distributions from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non regulated subsidiaries may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cash flows  business and financial condition 
on december   three of our florida regulated subsidiaries declared dividends to one of our non regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million  two of which were paid on december  and one of which was paid on january  in addition  we currently intend to cause certain of our other regulated subsidiaries to declare dividends and or distributions to us or certain of our non regulated subsidiaries in an effort to increase our unregulated cash balances 
in most states  we are required to seek the prior approval of state regulatory authorities to transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts or  in some states  any amount 
the discretion of the state regulators  if any  in approving or disapproving a dividend or intercompany transaction is often not clearly defined 
health plans that declare non extraordinary dividends usually must provide notice to the regulators in advance of the intended distribution date of such dividend 
if our state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and or distributions by certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non regulated subsidiaries  our liquidity  cash flows  business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
claims relating to medical malpractice and other litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 
our providers involved in medical care decisions and associates involved in coverage decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
some states have passed or are considering legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations  or eliminates the requirement that providers carry a minimum amount of professional liability insurance 
this kind of legislation has the effect of shifting the liability for medical decisions or adverse outcomes to the managed care organization 
this could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or could cause us to pay additional premiums to increase our insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our associates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 
from time to time  we are party to various other litigation matters including the matters discussed in part i item legal proceedings  some of which seek monetary damages 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any pending litigation or potential future litigation  and we may incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits or indemnifying third parties with respect to the results of such litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 
we maintain errors and omissions policies as well as other insurance coverage 
however  potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations  or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future or that insurance will continue to be available to us on a cost effective basis 
moreover  even if claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit  we would have to defend ourselves against such claims 
the defense of any such actions may be time consuming and costly and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
risks related to our financial condition our senior secured credit facility  which is currently in default and subject to acceleration by the lenders  will become due and payable on may   and we cannot provide any assurances that adverse developments will not arise that would impede our ability to pay the outstanding balance of approximately million when it becomes due 
our senior secured credit facility with wachovia bank  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders  which has a term loan facility with an outstanding balance of approximately million as of december   is currently in default and subject to acceleration by the lenders and  absent acceleration by the lenders  will become due and payable on may  our senior secured credit facility also included a revolving credit facility that expired in may although we are not in payment default  we are in default of a number of covenants contained in the credit agreement including our failure to provide the lenders with audited financial statements  our budgets and other requested reports and information  and our inability to maintain certain leverage ratios  some of which cannot be cured prior to maturity of the senior secured credit facility such as our entry into intercompany loan transactions  which are described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  that were not effected in compliance with the credit agreement 
as of the date hereof  our payment obligations under the credit agreement have not been accelerated and the rate of interest has not been increased 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that such obligations will not be accelerated or the rate of interest increased in the future or that the lenders will not exercise other remedies for default 

table of contents we cannot provide any assurances that adverse developments will not arise that impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility when it becomes due 
in particular  the timing and amount of any potential resolution of pending investigations by the usao  the civil division  the oig and the state of florida are uncertain and could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our near term obligations  including repayment of the outstanding balance under the credit facility 
also  our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility could be materially and adversely affected if  among other things  florida regulators were to require certain of our intercompany loan arrangements which total approximately million to be terminated 
in addition  there may be other potential adverse developments that could impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility 
based on third party information  we believe that fairholme capital management  llc fairholme  who also is our largest shareholder  has purchased approximately of the outstanding balance under our term loan facility 
as a holder of a majority of the outstanding balance under our term loan facility  fairholme has the ability to require the exercise of remedies for default  including accelerating our payment obligations and or increasing the rate of interest 
if we are unsuccessful in our initiative to raise additional unregulated cash  our unregulated cash balances could deteriorate  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
we are pursuing financing alternatives to  among other things  increase our unregulated cash balances 
financing alternatives that we are pursuing include  but are not limited to  seeking dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access available excess capital and pursuing external financing sources 
one or more factors may cause us to be unable to raise additional unregulated cash  including  among others continued turmoil in the financial markets and general adverse economic conditions make it unlikely that we will be able to obtain financing and also may make it more difficult or prohibitively costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt or common stock  the uncertainty created by the ongoing state and federal investigations is adversely affecting our ability to obtain financing  required capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries are greater than anticipated  resulting from  among other things  lower than expected profitability in our regulated subsidiaries or the imposition of greater capital requirements by state insurance regulators such as the recent request by one of our regulators to contribute a total of approximately million in additional statutory capital into two of our hmos  we are unable to obtain the approval of state regulatory authorities to cause certain of our regulated subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends to us or our non regulated subsidiaries  management fees received by our non regulated third party administrator subsidiary are less than anticipated as a result of lower than expected premium revenues in our regulated subsidiaries  the lenders under our senior secured credit facility accelerate repayment of the outstanding indebtedness thereunder  florida regulators require the regulated subsidiaries to terminate certain intercompany loan arrangements in the amount of million  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  necessitating the borrowing subsidiary to repay in full the amount owed to the florida regulated subsidiaries  or other restrictions are placed on the use of proceeds from such loans  and or we are required to pay significant fines or penalties in the near term to resolve one or more of the federal or state investigations or we do not prevail in one or more of the actions described under part i item legal proceedings 
if we are unsuccessful in our initiative to raise additional unregulated cash  our unregulated cash balances could deteriorate  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent disruptions in the financial markets and the general economic slowdown could cause us to be unable to obtain financing and expose us to risks related to the overall macro economic environment  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the united states equity and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many equities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing  even for companies who are otherwise qualified to obtain financing 
these events make it unlikely that we will be able to obtain financing and also may make it more difficult or prohibitively costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of debt or common stock 
in addition  due to the general economic slowdown  we may be exposed to risks related to the overall macro economic environment  including a lower rate of return than we have historically experienced on our invested assets  being limited in our ability to sell or liquidate our invested assets  such as our auction rate securities  and receiving inadequate premium payments from our government payors due to state budget constraints 
such risks  if realized  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our significant debt obligations  the restrictions under which we operate as set forth in our senior secured credit facility  and our default status under our senior secured credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  business strategy  liquidity and cash flow position 
we have outstanding indebtedness as of december  of approximately million under our senior secured credit facility 
as noted above  our senior secured credit facility is currently in default and the lenders have the right to exercise remedies for default  including  among others  accelerating the amounts due under the credit facility  increasing the rate of interest and preventing us from accessing funds held by certain of our regulated subsidiaries 
as of the date hereof  the lenders have not exercised any such remedies for default  but we cannot provide any assurance that they will not do so in the future 
in the absence of the exercise of remedies by the lenders  our senior secured credit facility becomes due and payable on may  the required repayment of the outstanding balance will materially reduce our outstanding cash balances unless we are able to refinance this debt 
our current default status and near term obligation to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility also may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business strategy resulting from  among others  the following increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic  regulatory and industry conditions  and placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors  limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and limiting our ability to fund capital expenditures  capital reserve requirements  acquisitions  and general  corporate and other operating purposes 
in addition  restrictions and covenants in the documents governing our senior secured credit facility including prescribed fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios and limitations on capital expenditures and acquisitions may cause our financial and operating flexibility to be limited by  among other things  restricting our ability to i engage in certain transactions  ii incur liens  iii declare dividends to shareholders without lender approval  iv fund capital expenditures  capital reserve requirements  acquisitions  and general  corporate and other operating purposes  and v incurring indebtedness 
our failure to comply with covenants in our debt instruments could result in our indebtedness being immediately due and payable and the loss of our assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
our credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of our non regulated entities  which includes the stock of our regulated subsidiaries directly held by our non regulated entities 
if we fail to pay any of our indebtedness when due  or if we breach any of the other covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness  such as the obligation to provide the lenders audited financial statements  it may result in one or more events of default 
as a result of the on going investigations discussed in note  the company has been unable to satisfy a number of its obligations under the credit agreement  including providing audited financial statements  annual financial plans and other information sought by the lenders under the credit agreement 
consequently  since november the company has been in technical default under the terms of this credit agreement 
in addition  since september   the company was in default of certain covenants set forth in the credit agreement requiring the company to maintain certain leverage ratios 
the company continues to make payments as required  and consequently  there has been no payment default under the terms of the credit agreement 
to date  the lenders have not accelerated any amounts outstanding under the credit facility  proceeded against the collateral securing the indebtedness or exercised other remedies  but we cannot assure you that they will not do 
table of contents so in the future 
if the lenders accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facility  proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness or exercise other remedies  our business  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
downgrades in our debt ratings may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  access to capital markets  and our ability to obtain alternative financing options 
claims paying ability  financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of managed care insurance companies 
ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout our industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in promoting our services to certain of our constituents 
our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to providers 
downgrades in our ratings  should they occur  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  access to capital markets  and our ability to obtain alternative financing options 
our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks that may cause losses and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
as of december    all of our long term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  which carry investment grade credit ratings 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually anywhere from seven to days 
recently  auctions for some of these auction rate securities have failed and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven   or days  as the case may be  until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non existent 
we may be required to wait until market stability is restored for these instruments or until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
risks related to being a regulated entity cms s risk adjustment payment system makes our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
cms has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for medicare health plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for medicare plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms s risk adjustment model bases a portion of the total cms reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors including hospital inpatient diagnoses  diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings  including hospital outpatient facilities and physician visits  gender  age  and medicaid eligibility 
cms requires all managed care companies to capture  collect  and report the necessary diagnosis code information to cms 
because of medicare advantage premiums are now risk based  it is more difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue or profitability 
in addition  cms establishes premium payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions during the year on a retroactive basis 
the first such adjustments update the risk scores for the current year based on prior year s dates of service 
the second such adjustment is a final retroactive risk premium settlement for the prior year 
as a result of the variability of factors  including plan risk scores  that determine such estimates  the actual amount of cms s retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates 
consequently  our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period and our accrual of premiums related thereto may result in adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
on february   cms published preliminary results of a study designed to assess the degree of coding pattern differences between original medicare and medicare advantage and the extent to which any such differences could be appropriately addressed by an adjustment to risk scores 
cms s study of risk scores for medicare populations from through found that 
table of contents medicare advantage member risk scores increased substantially more than the risk scores for the general medicare fee for service population 
cms found that the overall risk scores of stayers a cms term referring to those persons who were enrolled either in the same medicare advantage plan or in original medicare during the study periods in medicare advantage increased more than those of original medicare stayers 
accordingly  in the advance notice of methodological changes for calendar year for medicare advantage capitation rates and part d payment policies  cms summarized findings from its analysis of risk scores over the time period and proposed to apply a coding difference adjustment to contracts whose disease scores for stayers exceeded fee for service by twice the industry average 
the agency proposed to apply an adjustment that was calculated based on those contracts that fell above the threshold 
in response to the advance notice  cms received a significant number of comments on the proposed adjustment for medicare advantage coding differences  most of which disagreed with the view that cms had identified differences in coding patterns between medicare advantage and fee for service medicare 
cms then decided not to make a coding intensity adjustment for on february   cms published the day advance notice for the preliminary rating methodology 
for calendar year  a negative coding intensity adjustment factor will apply to all managed care plans 
plans will receive final rates for in april if the coding intensity adjustment factor is implemented as proposed  this would result in a significant decrease in our medicare revenues 
reductions in funding for government health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
all of the health care services we offer are through government sponsored programs  such as medicaid and medicare 
as a result  our profitability is dependent  in large part  on continued funding for government health care programs at or above current levels 
for example  the premium rates paid by each state to health plans like ours differ depending on a combination of factors such as upper payment limits established by the state and federal governments  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility categories 
future medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints 
some of the states in which we operate have experienced fiscal challenges leading to significant budget deficits 
according to the national association of state budget officers  medicaid spending consumes approximately one quarter of the average state s budget  representing the second largest expenditure 
health care spending increases appear to be more limited than in the past  states continue to look at medicaid programs as opportunities for budget savings and some states may find it difficult to continue paying current rates to medicaid health plans 
changes in medicaid funding may lead to reductions in the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for medicaid  reductions in the amount of reimbursement or elimination of coverage for certain benefits such as pharmacy  behavioral health or other benefits 
in some cases  changes in funding could be made retroactive  in which case we may be required to return premiums already received or receive reduced future payments 
in the recent past  all of the states in which we operate have implemented or considered legislation or regulations that would reduce reimbursement rates  payment levels  benefits covered or the number of persons eligible for medicaid 
reductions in medicaid payments could reduce our profitability if we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate 
further  continued economic slowdowns in our markets have negatively impacted state revenues 
the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline more rapidly or in tandem with declining economic conditions 
for example  the governments that oversee the medicaid programs could choose to limit program eligibility in an effort to reduce the portion of their respective state budgets attributable to medicaid  which would cause our membership and revenues to decrease 
therefore  declining general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease even further  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the states may also develop future medicaid capitation rates that  while actuarially sound  are insufficient to keep pace with medical trends or inflation  therefore reducing our profitability in those markets and materially adversely affecting our results of operations 
we are experiencing pressure on rates in florida and georgia  two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue 
in  florida implemented medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to participate in the medicaid reform programs 
as a result  we notified the state of florida that we were withdrawing from these programs effective july   which will result in a loss of approximately  members 
new legislation in georgia related to payment of claims  eligibility determination and provider contracting  may negatively impact revenues and profits for the plan in and beyond 
further  continued economic slowdowns in florida and georgia  as well as other states  could result in additional state actions that could adversely affect our revenues 
similar to medicaid  reductions in payments under medicare or the other programs under which we offer health plans could likewise reduce our profitability 
the mma permits premium levels for certain medicare plans to be established through competitive bidding  with congress retaining the ability to limit increases in premium levels established through bidding from year to year 
the federal government also has passed legislation that phases out medicare advantage budget neutrality payments through  which impacts premium increases over that timeframe 
the us congress is considering other reductions to rates or other changes to medicare part d which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
cms recently announced preliminary medicare advantage payment rates which are between and below rates 
assuming the physician rate cut implicit in the rates is not enacted  the following are among the events that are likely to occur member benefits will be reduced  member 
table of contents premiums will be increased  and margins will decline 
these events are likely to have a negative affect on our operating results and membership 
in january  the new presidential administration took office 
although the new administration and recently elected us congress have expressed some support for measures intended to expand the number of citizens covered by health insurance and other changes within the health care system  the costs of implementing any of these proposals could be financed  in part  by reductions in the payments made to under medicare and other government programs 
similarly  although the us congress approved the children s health bill which  among things  increases federal funding to s chip and president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act that provides funding for  among other things  state medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts  because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives  the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how medicaid and s chip funds will be used  we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  and any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate 
the laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than stockholders 
the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them 
these laws and regulations  along with the terms of our government contracts  regulate how we do business  what services we offer  and how we interact with our members  providers and the public 
any violation by us of applicable laws and regulations could reduce our revenues and profitability  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are subject to periodic reviews and audits under our contracts with state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we contract with various governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in forfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties  fines or other sanctions on us and or our key associates  loss of our right to participate in government sponsored programs  including medicaid and medicare  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in marketing our products and services  inability to obtain approval for future service or geographic expansion  and suspension or loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer  hmo or third party administrator or to otherwise provide a service 
we are currently undergoing standard periodic audits by several departments of insurance and cms to verify compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
in  cms completed its routine comprehensive audit of all of our medicare operations 
cms s audit report indicates that we are deficient in a number of areas 
we implemented corrective action plans to address cms s findings  but in february  cms notified us that  effective march   we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing to medicare beneficiaries and enrollments into all lines of our medicare business 
this suspension will remain in effect until cms determines that the suspension should be lifted 
among other areas  cms s decision was based on findings of deficiencies in our enrollment and disenrollment operations  appeals and grievances  timely and proper responses to beneficiary complaints and requests for assistance  and marketing and agent broker oversight activities 
we are working closely with cms to address their concerns 
at this time  we cannot provide any assurances regarding the duration of the suspension or the ultimate impact it will have on our results of operations and our business 
nonetheless  we anticipate that our inability to perform marketing activities to medicare beneficiaries  or enroll new medicare members into our plans  as well as any actions that we take in response to the sanctions  will have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and business in and potentially beyond 
we are subject to laws and government regulations that may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions favorable to shareholders 

table of contents we are subject to state laws regarding insurers and hmos that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies that require prior regulatory approval for any change of control of an hmo or insurance subsidiary 
for purposes of these laws  in most states control is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity acquires the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity  subject to certain exceptions 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  including through transactions  and in particular through unsolicited transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions that some or all of our shareholders find favorable 
we are subject to extensive fraud and abuse laws which may give rise to lawsuits and claims against us  the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies  we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as fraud and abuse laws  including the federal false claims act  which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute suit against us for violations and  in some cases  to seek treble damages  penalties and assessments 
liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know or it is found that we should have known that information we provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent  and some courts have permitted false claims act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements 
qui tam actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government 
qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years  causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend a false claim action  pay fines or be excluded from the medicare  medicaid or other state or federal health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action 
many states  including states where we currently operate  have enacted parallel legislation 
in a letter dated october   the civil division informed counsel to the special committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry  the civil division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the false claims act  usc sections the seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the civil division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints 
the complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by usc section b 
we and the special committee are undertaking to discuss with the civil division  and address  allegations by the qui tam relators 
we also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on october  in state court for leon county  florida against several defendants  including us and one of our subsidiaries 
because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing  we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and  therefore  we do not know at this time whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations 
it is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the false claims act  or similar state statutes  based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this form k 
we can give no assurances that we will not be subject to civil actions and enforcement proceedings under these federal and state statutes and regulations in the future 
any such claims  proceedings or violations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if state regulatory agencies require a higher statutory capital level for our existing operations or if we become subject to additional capital requirements  we may be required to make additional capital contributions to our regulated subsidiaries  which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity 
our operations are conducted through licensed hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital and maintenance of certain financial ratios  as defined by each state 
one or more of these states may raise the statutory capital level from time to time  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity 
for example  new york adopted regulations that increase the capital reserve requirement by over an eight year period 
the phased in increase in reserve requirements to which our new york plan is subject will  over time  materially increase our reserve requirements in new york 
other states may elect to adopt risk based capital requirements based on guidelines adopted by the naic 
as of december   our operations in connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri and ohio  and our pdp and pffs operations  were subject to such guidelines 
our subsidiaries also may be required to maintain higher levels of statutory net worth due to the adoption of risk based capital requirements by other states in which we operate 
our subsidiaries are subject to their state regulators general oversight powers 
regardless of whether a state adopts the risk based capital requirements  the state s regulators can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interests of our members 
in addition  as we continue to expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
in either case  any additional capital contribution made to one or more of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents liquidity  cash flows and growth potential  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy by  for example  hindering our ability to make debt service payments on amounts drawn from our credit facilities 
in addition  increases of statutory capital requirements could cause us to withdraw from certain programs or markets where it becomes economically difficult to continue to be profitable 
for example  we recently evaluated the capitalization requirement for our pffs plans and determined that it was economically prudent to withdraw from participation in these plans in texas  florida and wisconsin since the capital requirements for these states applied to the subsidiary as a whole  effectively increasing the capital requirements for several other states operating under the same license 
if we restructure our insurance licenses for florida  texas and wisconsin such that the capital requirements apply only to the business in those states  we may re consider our interest in offering products in those states 
accordingly  effective january  we exited the pffs business in these three states in which we provided services to approximately  members 
additionally  one or more of our regulators could require one or more of our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators were to determine that such a requirement were in the interest of our members 
for example  a state regulator recently notified us that in its view  notwithstanding a parental guarantee that has been in place since  two of our hmos should contribute a total of approximately million in additional statutory capital 
we are currently discussing this request with the regulator 
we derive a substantial portion of our medicare revenues from our pdp operations  and legislative or regulatory actions  economic conditions  bidding results or other factors that adversely affect those pdp operations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we derive a substantial portion of our medicare revenues from our pdp operations 
our ability to operate our pdp plans profitably depends on our ability to attract members  to price our plans appropriately  to continue to develop core systems and processes  to manage our medical expenses related to these plans and other factors 
we do not know whether we will be able to sustain our pdp operations profitability over the long term  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
there are numerous factors that could have a materially adverse effect on our pdp operations  as well our medicare part d and other plans in general 
those that are particularly applicable to our pdp operations include risk corridors the mma provides for risk corridors that are designed to limit to some extent the losses pdp plans would incur if the medical expenses exceed the reimbursement to be received from cms 
these risk corridors are designed to widen over time 
the risk corridors for and provided more protection against excess losses than are available for and future years as the thresholds increase and the reimbursement percentages decrease 
reimbursement or other reconciliations from cms could be delayed  which could cause us to incur more up front costs for operating the program 
annual bidding along with other part d plans  including pdps and ma pds  we bid on part d benefits in june each year 
based on the bids submitted  cms establishes a national benchmark 
plans that bid below the benchmark are eligible to have members automatically assigned to them 
consequently  our ability to bid below the benchmark impacts our ability to receive automatically assigned members 
as previously described  we bid above the cms benchmark in of the cms regions for plan year and are ineligible to receive auto assigned members in these regions 
as a result   auto assigned dual eligible members were assigned away from our plans and approximately  low income subsidized members disenrolled from our plans in january competition we have encountered competition from other pdp plans  some of which may have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do  and new pdp plans are entering the business 
during the annual bidding process described above  we compete with other plans to bid below the cms benchmark for auto assigned members 
during the annual open enrollment period  we compete with other pdp plans to obtain members who can select their pdp plan 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to continue to compete effectively in this market 
those factors that apply to all of our medicare plans  including pdp and part d  include membership medicare beneficiaries who are dual eligibles generally are able to disenroll and choose another pdp plan at any time  and certain other medicare beneficiaries also may have a limited ability to disenroll from the plan they initially select and choose a different pdp plan 
all medicare beneficiaries are able to change pdp plans during the annual open enrollment period 
we may not be able to retain the auto assigned members or those members who affirmatively choose our pdp plans  and we may not be able to attract new pdp members 
benefits expense we may experience higher benefits expense as a result of an increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals  possible changes in our pharmacy rebate program with drug manufacturers  higher than expected utilization and new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs 

table of contents regulatory and administration cms may alter the medicare part d program in a manner that could be detrimental to us 
utilization of benefits we make actuarial assumptions about the utilization of benefits in our pdp plans 
because our membership mix changes in this program from year to year  our assumptions are based on data that may not be applicable to our current pdp membership base and we cannot assure you that these assumptions will prove to be correct or that premiums will be sufficient to cover the benefits provided 
several changes to the medicare program resulting from the mippa legislation that became effective in could increase competition for our existing and prospective members and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
on july   mippa became law and in september cms promulgated enabling regulations 
mippa impacts a broad range of medicare activities and impacts all types of medicare managed care plans 
all of the changes imposed on us by mippa  including those discussed below  have the potential to cause us to incur additional administrative expense  lose membership and ultimately reduce our medicare revenues  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations pffs plans mippa revises requirements for medicare advantage pffs plans  which may have the effect of ending some of these plans in plan year where such plans are not able to comply with these new requirements 
in particular  mippa requires all pffs plans that operate in markets with two or more networked based plans must be offered on a networked basis 
currently  we do not have provider networks in the majority of the markets where we offer pffs plans 
we are currently evaluating alternative solutions to establishing a network in targeted areas to meet these requirements  including building a contracted network  contracting with a third party network or withdrawing from certain counties where it is not economically or otherwise feasible to establish networks for this line of business 
sales and marketing mippa places prohibitions and limitations on specified sales and marketing activities under medicare advantage and prescription drug plans 
among other things  medicare plans are no longer permitted to make unsolicited contact with potential members by way of outbound telemarketing and community marketing  offer other types of medicare products to existing members  provide meals to potential enrollees or approach potential members in common or public areas 
these changes are likely to increase our administrative costs of enrolling an individual  and could increase the risk of compliance violations and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enroll new medicare members particularly because we have historically relied to a large extent on outbound telemarketing and community marketing to sell our products 
although we utilized alternative marketing methods during the most recent medicare enrollment period  we are continuing to evaluate and assess how these mippa changes will affect our ability to obtain medicare advantage members and how we will use the most effective alternative marketing methods allowed under mippa to educate potential members regarding our products and services 
special needs plans a significant portion of our coordinated care plan membership is enrolled in our d snps 
under mippa  d snps such as ours are required to contract with state medicaid agencies to coordinate benefits 
the scope of the d snp contract with the state medicaid agency will depend greatly on what eligibility categories  cost sharing responsibilities and payment limitations each state has included in its state plan 
the contracting process under mippa provides an opportunity for d snps and states to improve the coordination of benefits  including defining the overlap between medicaid and medicare benefits  eligibility verification processes  payment and coverage responsibilities  marketing and enrollment standards  appeals and grievances procedures and other important operational considerations 
collaboration between states and d snps is expected to create administrative efficiencies and improve beneficiary health outcomes 
however  the requirement to contract with state medicaid agencies imposes potential risk for d snp providers such as us because mippa does not allow expansion in or continued operation of a d snp after if a state and the d snp provider cannot come to agreement on terms 
compensation mippa also establishes limits on agent and broker compensation 
the cms implementing regulations require that plans that pay commissions do so by paying for an initial year commission and residual commissions for each of the five subsequent renewal years  thereby creating a six year commission cycle for members moving from original medicare and a five year commission cycle for members moving from another medicare advantage plan 
reductions or delays in federal and state funding for health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
the federal government and many states from time to time consider reducing the level of funding for government health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
for example  the deficit reduction act of  signed into law on february   includes reductions in federal medicaid spending by approximately billion and reductions to medicare spending by approximately billion over a period of five years  according to the congressional budget office 
the act reduces spending by cutting medicaid payments for prescription drugs and 
table of contents gives states new power to reduce or reconfigure benefits 
this law may also lead to lower medicaid reimbursements in some states 
states also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid and other programs 
in recent years  the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid and other health care programs costs and eligibility 
changes to medicaid and other health care programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs  all of which could have a negative impact on our business 
we believe that reductions in medicaid and other health care program payments could substantially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds  such cancellations could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
premiums are contractually payable to us before or during the month for services that we are obligated to provide to our members 
our cash flow would be negatively impacted if premium payments are delayed or not made according to contract terms 
our contracts with the states in which we operate are subject to cancellation by the state in the event of inadequate program funding contained within such state s budget  and are also subject to decreases or limited increases in premiums  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and free cash available for operations and capital reserve requirements 
if a state in which we operate approves a budget that includes inadequate program funding  our contracts with that state are subject to cancellation by the state 
in some jurisdictions  such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
state governments generally are experiencing tight budgetary conditions within their medicaid programs 
budget problems in the states in which we operate could result in decreases or limited increases in the premiums paid to us by the states 
in some instances  it may result in the postponement of payment until additional funding sources are available 
for example and as described above  in february  we determined that it was economically unfeasible for us to continue participating in the medicaid reform program after florida notified us that it was reducing our reimbursement rates 
consequently  we notified the state of florida that we were withdrawing from the medicaid reform program effective july   which will result in a loss of approximately  members 
if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us  or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and free cash available for operations and capital reserve requirements 
we are required to comply with laws governing the transmission  security and privacy of health information  and we have not yet determined what our total compliance costs will be  however  such costs  when determined  could be more than anticipated  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
regulations under hipaa require us to comply with standards regarding the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties  such as health care providers  business associates and our members 
these regulations include standards for common health care transactions  such as claims information  plan eligibility  and payment information  unique identifiers for providers and employers  security  privacy  and enforcement 
hipaa also provides that to the extent that state laws impose stricter privacy standards than hipaa privacy regulations  a state seeks and receives an exception from the department of health and human services regarding certain state laws  or state laws concern certain specified areas  such state standards and laws will not be preempted 
we have implemented and are continuing to implement security policies and procedures to strive to achieve and maintain compliance with the security standards 
given hipaa s complexity and the possibility that the regulations may change and may be subject to changing and perhaps conflicting interpretation  our ongoing ability to comply with any of the hipaa requirements is uncertain 
furthermore  a state s ability to promulgate stricter laws  and uncertainty regarding many aspects of such state requirements  make compliance with applicable health information laws more difficult 
normal health plan operations require that we transmit protected health information via electronic or other means  often at the direction of and based on information provided by third parties  such as our providers  that could result in inadvertent violations of hipaa privacy or security rules 
in march  management learned that  in accordance with a contractual requirement  a company web developer had transmitted a document folder containing reports for the georgia department of community health dch to two production ports  one of which  unbeknownst to the web developer  was not secure 
consequently  data  including protected information  unintentionally was made accessible through the internet 
we incurred considerable remediation expenses in this matter and  on june   we paid  in response to a notification of breach and assessment of liquidated damages issued by dch 
our efforts to comply with hipaa and to remediate any violations of hipaa  including any fines and penalties  could cause us to incur substantial costs which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents future changes in health care law may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity 
health care laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
changes in existing laws or regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations could materially reduce our profitability  among other things  by imposing additional license  registration and or capital requirements  increasing our administrative and other costs  requiring us to undergo a corporate restructuring  increasing mandated benefits  limiting our ability to engage in intra company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries  requiring us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers  restricting our revenue and enrollment growth  requiring us to restructure our relationships with providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
changes in state law  regulations and rules also may materially adversely affect our profitability 
requirements relating to managed care consumer protection standards  including increased plan information disclosure  limits to premium increases  expedited appeals and grievance procedures  third party review of certain medical decisions  health plan liability  access to specialists  clean claim payment timing  physician collective bargaining rights and confidentiality of medical records either have been enacted or continue to be under discussion 
new health care reform legislation may require us to change the way we operate our business  which may be costly 
further  although we strive to exercise care in structuring our operations to attempt to comply in all material respects with the laws and regulations applicable to us  government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing such laws and or regulations have in the past asserted and may in the future assert that we or transactions in which we are involved are in violation of these laws  or courts may ultimately interpret such laws in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation 
therefore  it is possible that future legislation and regulation and the interpretation of laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate under the medicaid  medicare and s chip programs and to continue to serve our members and attract new members  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
state regulatory restrictions on our marketing activities may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues  which could have a material adverse effect in our results of operations 
although we enroll some of our new members through automatic enrollment programs and voluntary member enrollment  we rely on our marketing and sales efforts for a significant portion of our membership growth 
all of the states in which we currently operate permit advertising and  in most cases  direct sales but impose strict requirements and limitations as to the types of marketing activities that are permitted 
for example  in florida  we were recently subject to a day marketing freeze in three counties resulting from the state s allegation of wrongful marketing practices 
in addition  the state of georgia does not permit direct sales by medicaid health plans 
in georgia  we advertise our plans  but we rely on member selection and auto assignment of medicaid members into our plans 
effective january   all plans participating in the florida medicaid program are prohibited from directly selling their plans to medicaid recipients 
in circumstances where our marketing efforts are prohibited or curtailed  we may incur additional administrative expense in trying to obtain members and our ability to increase or sustain membership could be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a significant percentage of our medicaid plan enrollment results from mandatory medicaid enrollment in managed care plans 
states may mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care through cms approved plan amendments or  for certain groups  through federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are generally approved for two to five year periods  and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by cms 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state in which we operate does not mandate managed care enrollment in its state 
table of contents plan or does not renew an existing managed care waiver  our membership would likely decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by the government to collect premiums  and any inaccuracies in those lists cause states to recoup premium payments from us  which could materially reduce our revenues and profitability 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government 
from time to time  states require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received from the states based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program or have been enrolled twice in the same program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
for example  in july  we continued to receive premiums from the state of florida for members that had become eligible for both medicaid and medicare benefits 
once a recipient becomes dually eligible  their premium is primarily remitted by cms rather than the state 
in this case  the state of florida had not properly reduced the amount of premium they paid to us to reflect that cms was now the primary payor 
our review of all remittance files to identify potential duplicate members  members that should be terminated and members for which we have been paid an incorrect rate may not identify all such members 
in addition to recoupment of premiums previously paid  we also face the risk that a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment 
our profitability would be reduced as a result of the state s failure to pay us for related payments to providers we made and we were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 
we have established a reserve in anticipation of recoupment by the states of previously paid premiums  but ultimately our reserve may not be sufficient to cover the amount  if any  of recoupments 
if the amount of any recoupments exceeds our reserves  our revenues and profits could be materially reduced and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our failure to maintain accreditations could disqualify us from participation in the certain state medicaid programs  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
several of our medicaid contracts require that our plans or subcontracted providers be accredited by independent accrediting organizations that are focused on improving the quality of health care services 
accreditation by aaahc or comparable accreditation is a requirement for participation in the florida medicaid program 
further  florida medicaid plans can only subcontract behavioral health services to a urac accredited organization 
accreditation by ncqa is a requirement for participation in the georgia medicaid managed care program and the hawaii medicaid program requires that participating plans be either ncqa or urac accredited 
our florida health plans are accredited by the aaahc and our behavioral health subsidiary to which we subcontract behavioral health services is accredited by urac 
in july  as required by the terms of our medicaid contract  our georgia health plan was awarded accredited status by ncqa 
under the terms of our medicaid contract  we have until january  to obtain ncqa accreditation in hawaii 
failure to maintain our aaahc or urac accreditations in florida or ncqa accreditation in georgia could disqualify us from participation in the florida and georgia medicaid businesses  respectively 
similarly  failure to obtain ncqa accreditation in hawaii by january  could disqualify us from participation in the hawaii medicaid program 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain  or obtain  our ncqa  urac or aaahc accreditations  and the loss of  or failure to obtain  these accreditations could adversely our ability to participate in certain medicaid programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to our common stock future sales  or the availability for sale  of our common stock may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect the market price of our common stock and could materially impair our future ability to raise capital through offerings of our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase  shares of our common stock  of which  were exercisable  at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
from time to time  we may issue additional options to associates  non employee directors  consultants and others pursuant to our equity incentive plans 

table of contents the provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and make it more difficult for a stockholder to elect directors of its choosing 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and provisions of applicable delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests  make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that stockholders may consider unfavorable

we also lease office space for our health plans in florida  new york  illinois  indiana  connecticut  georgia  ohio  louisiana  hawaii  new jersey  missouri and texas 
we believe these facilities are suitable and provide the appropriate level of capacity for our current operations 
item legal proceedings 
set forth below is a description of the current status of the investigations  actions and lawsuits arising from or consequential to the restatement and special committee investigation government investigations we are currently under investigation by several federal and state authorities  including ahca  the usao  the civil division  the oig and mcfu 
we are engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the usao  the civil division  the oig and the state of florida 
based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  in the year ended december  we recorded selling  general and administrative expense and accrued a liability in the amount of million in connection with the resolution of these matters  which is included in the other accrued expenses line item within our consolidated balance sheets as of december   and  respectively 
we believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have already been reflected in our financial statements  however  we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the usao  the civil division  the oig or the state of florida 
for more information related to this accrual  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in addition to the federal and state governmental investigations referenced above  as previously disclosed  the sec is conducting an informal investigation 
we also are responding to subpoenas issued by the state of connecticut attorney general s office involving transactions between the company and its affiliates and their potential impact on the costs of connecticut s medicaid program 
we have communicated with regulators in states in which our hmo and insurance operating subsidiaries are domiciled regarding the investigations 
we are cooperating with federal and state regulators and enforcement officials in these matters 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  any pending investigations might lead to the payment of fines  penalties or operating restrictions 
in addition  in a letter dated october   the civil division informed counsel to the special committee that as part of the pending civil inquiry  the civil division is investigating a number of qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the false claims act  usc sections the seal in those cases has been partially lifted for the purpose of authorizing the civil division to disclose to us the existence of the qui tam complaints 
the complaints otherwise remain under seal as required by usc section b 
we and the special committee are undertaking to discuss with the civil division  and address  allegations by the qui tam relators 
we also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action on october  in state court for leon county  florida against several defendants  including us and one of our subsidiaries 
because qui tam actions brought under federal and state false claims acts are sealed by the court at the time of filing  we are unable to determine the nature of the allegations and  
table of contents therefore  we do not know at this time whether this action relates to the subject matter of the federal investigations 
it is possible that additional qui tam actions have been filed against us and are under seal 
thus  it is possible that we are subject to liability exposure under the false claims act  or similar state statutes  based on qui tam actions other than those discussed in this form k 
class action and derivative lawsuits putative class action complaints were filed on october  and november  these putative class actions  entitled eastwood enterprises  llc v 
farha  et al 
and hutton v 
wellcare health plans  inc et al  respectively  were filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida against the company  todd farha  the company s former chairman and chief executive officer  and paul behrens  the company s former senior vice president and chief financial officer 
messrs 
farha and behrens were also officers of various subsidiaries of the company 
the eastwood enterprises complaint alleges that the defendants materially misstated the company s reported financial condition by  among other things  purportedly overstating revenue and understating expenses in amounts unspecified in the pleading in violation of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the hutton complaint alleges that various public statements supposedly issued by defendants were materially misleading because they failed to disclose that the company was purportedly operating its business in a potentially illegal and improper manner in violation of applicable federal guidelines and regulations 
the complaint asserts claims under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
both complaints seek  among other things  certification as a class action and damages 
the two actions have been consolidated  and various parties and law firms filed motions seeking to be designated as lead plaintiff and lead counsel 
in an order issued on march   the court appointed a group of five public pension funds from new mexico  louisiana and chicago as lead plaintiffs 
on october   an amended consolidated complaint was filed in this class action against the company  messrs 
farha and behrens  and adding thaddeus bereday  the company s former senior vice president and general counsel  as a defendant 
on january   the company and certain other defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint  arguing  among other things  that the complaint failed to allege a material misstatement by defendants with respect to the company s compliance with marketing and other health care regulations and failed to plead facts raising a strong inference of scienter with respect to all aspects of the purported fraud claim 
briefing on this motion is continuing 
the company intends to defend itself vigorously against these claims 
at this time  neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries can predict the probable outcome of these claims 
accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements for these claims 
five putative shareholder derivative actions were filed between october  and november  the first two actions  entitled rosky v 
farha  et al 
and rooney v 
farha  et al  respectively  are purportedly brought on behalf of the company and were filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida 
two additional actions  entitled intermountain ironworkers trust fund v 
farha  et al  and myra kahn trust v 
farha  et al  were filed in circuit court for hillsborough county  florida 
all four of these actions are asserted against all company directors and former director todd farha except for d 
robert graham  heath schiesser and charles g 
berg and also name the company as a nominal defendant 
a fifth action  entitled irvin v 
behrens  et al  was filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida and asserts claims against all company directors and former director todd farha except heath schiesser and charles g 
berg and against two former company officers  paul behrens and thaddeus bereday 
all five actions contend  among other things  that the defendants allegedly allowed or caused the company to misrepresent its reported financial results  in amounts unspecified in the pleadings  and seek damages and equitable relief for  among other things  the defendants supposed breach of fiduciary duty  waste and unjust enrichment 
the three actions in federal court have been consolidated 
subsequent to that consolidation  an additional derivative complaint entitled city of philadelphia board of pensions and retirement fund v 
farha  et al 
was filed in the same federal court  but thereafter was consolidated into the existing consolidated action 
a motion to consolidate the two state court actions  to which all parties consented  was granted  and plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on april  on october   amended complaints were filed in the federal court and the state court derivative actions 
on december   the company filed substantially similar motions to dismiss both actions  contesting  among other things  the standing of the plaintiffs in each of these derivative actions to prosecute the purported claims in the company s name 
briefing on these motions is continuing 
at this time  neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries can predict the probable outcome of these claims 
accordingly  no amounts have been accrued in the company s consolidated financial statements for these claims 
other lawsuits and claims separate and apart from the legal matters described above  we are also involved in other legal actions that are in the normal course of our business  some of which seek monetary damages  including claims for punitive damages  which are not covered by insurance

due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k  we were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data beginning on page and our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements  business and elsewhere in this form k 
overview current financial condition financial impact of government investigations and litigation we do not know whether  or the extent to which  any pending investigations and related litigation discussed above under part i item legal proceedings will result in our payment of fines  penalties or damages  any of which would require us to incur additional expenses and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
furthermore  if as a result of the resolution of these matters we are subject to operating restrictions  revocation of our licenses  termination of one or more of our contracts and or exclusion from further participation in medicare or medicaid programs  our revenues and net income could be adversely affected 
we are engaged in resolution discussions as to matters under review with the usao  the civil division  the oig and the state of florida 
based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  in the year ended december  we recorded selling  general and administrative expense and accrued a liability in the amount of million in connection with the resolution of these matters  which is included in the other accrued expenses line item within our consolidated balance sheets as of december   and  respectively 
we believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have already been reflected in our financial statements  however  we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the usao  the civil division  the oig or the state of florida 
as discussed in more detail below  investigations and related matters have caused us to expend significant financial resources 
as of december   we had spent a cumulative amount of approximately million on administrative expenses associated with  or consequential to  the government and special committee investigations  including legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  employee recruitment and retention costs and similar expenses 
approximately million of these investigation related costs were incurred in and approximately million were incurred in we expect to continue incurring significant additional costs in as a result of the federal and state investigations and pending civil actions  including administrative expenses and costs necessary to improve our corporate governance and address other issues that were identified 
current cash position as of december   our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were approximately  million 
as of december   our consolidated investments were approximately million 
as of december   we had unregulated cash of approximately million and unregulated investments of approximately million 
on december   three of our florida regulated subsidiaries declared dividends to one of our non regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million  two of which were paid on december  and one of which was paid on january  the proceeds of such dividends are reflected in our unregulated cash balances as of december   with the exception of the dividends received on january  
table of contents our credit facility and near term cash obligations as previously disclosed  our senior secured credit facility with wachovia bank  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders  which has a term loan facility with an outstanding balance of approximately million as of december   is currently in default and subject to acceleration by the lenders and  absent acceleration by the lenders  will become due and payable on may  our senior secured credit facility also included a revolving credit facility that expired in may taking into account  among other things  the increase in our unregulated cash balances as a result of our receipt of the million in dividends described above  we currently expect that we will be able to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility when it becomes due 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that adverse developments will not arise that impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility when it becomes due 
in particular  the timing and amount of any potential resolution of pending investigations by the usao  the civil division  the oig and the state of florida are uncertain and could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our near term obligations  including repayment of the outstanding balance under the credit facility 
also  our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility could be materially and adversely affected if  among other things  florida regulators were to require certain of our intercompany loan arrangements  which total approximately million  to be terminated 
in addition  there may be other potential adverse developments that could impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility 
we also have a number of other near term obligations  including currently anticipated capital contributions to certain of our regulated subsidiaries or the imposition of greater capital requirements by state insurance regulators such as the recent request by one of our regulators to contribute a total of approximately million in additional statutory capital into two of our hmos 
in addition  we anticipate significant costs associated with the government and special committee investigations  including legal  accounting and consulting fees  and employee recruitment and retention costs

business and financial outlook general economic  political and financial market conditions as a result of economic uncertainty  many of the states in which we operate have experienced significant fiscal challenges  which are likely to result in budget deficits 
in light of these budgetary challenges  the medicaid segment premiums we receive likely will not keep pace with anticipated medical expense increases 
while the economic downturn may increase the number of medicaid recipients under current eligibility criteria  states may revise the eligibility criteria to reduce the number of people who are eligible for our plans 
on february   cms published the day advance notice for the preliminary rating methodology 
for calendar year  a negative coding intensity adjustment factor will apply to all managed care plans 
plans will receive final rates for in april if the coding intensity adjustment factor is implemented as proposed  this would result in a significant decrease in our medicare revenues 
these events are likely to have a negative effect on our operating results and membership 
furthermore  federal budgetary challenges or policy changes could result in rates that do not keep pace with anticipated medical expense increases  which could have a material adverse effect on our performance in the medicaid or medicare segments 
in addition  increasing market volatility and the tightening of the credit markets has significantly limited our ability to access external capital  which has  and is likely to continue to have  an adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy 
however  we continue to pursue financing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash  including seeking dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries and accessing the public and private equity and debt markets 
government funding continues to be a significant challenge to our business  particularly in light of the current economic conditions 
because the health care services we offer are through government sponsored programs  our profitability is largely dependent on continued funding for government health care programs at or above current levels 
future medicaid premium rate levels may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs or state and federal budgetary constraints 
some of the states in which we operate have experienced fiscal challenges leading to significant budget deficits 
health care spending increases appear to be more limited than in the past as states continue to look at medicaid programs as opportunities for budget savings  and some states may find it difficult to continue paying current rates to medicaid health plans 
in particular  we are experiencing pressure on rates in florida and georgia  two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue 
in  florida implemented medicaid rates that made it economically unfeasible for us to continue to provide services in certain counties and programs 
as a result  we notified the state of florida that we were withdrawing from the medicaid reform programs effective july   which will result in a loss of approximately  members 
new or proposed legislation in georgia related to 
table of contents payment of claims  program design  eligibility determination and provider contracting  may negatively impact revenues and profits for the plan in and beyond 
further  continued economic slowdowns in florida and georgia  as well as other states  could result in additional state actions that could adversely affect our revenues 
in january  the new presidential administration took office 
although the new administration and recently elected us congress have expressed some support for measures intended to expand the number of citizens covered by health insurance and other changes within the health care system  the costs of implementing any of these proposals could be financed  in part  by reductions in the payments made to medicare advantage and other government programs 
similarly  although the us congress approved the children s health bill which  among things  increases federal funding to the s chip and president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act that provides funding for  among other things  state medicaid programs and aid to states to help defray budget cuts  because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives  the numerous steps required to implement them and the substantial amount of state flexibility for determining how medicaid and s chip funds will be used  we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact that they will have on our business 
it is possible that the ultimate impact of these initiatives could be negative 
medicare competition  pdp outlook in our medicare segment  we are experiencing increased competition 
as the result of the part d bidding process for plan year  we bid above the benchmark in of the regions 
as a result  as of december   approximately  auto assigned dual eligible members were assigned away from our plans 
in addition  approximately  low income subsidized members disenrolled from our plans in january we estimate that  based on these factors as well as new members choosing to enroll in our plans  new auto assignment of members and other factors  our revenues generated from our pdp plans will decrease significantly for in addition  several changes to the medicare program resulting from mippa that became effective in could increase competition for our existing and prospective members  which could adversely affect our revenues 
execution of business strategy to achieve our business strategy  we continue to look for economically viable opportunities to expand our business within our existing markets  expand our current service territory and develop new product initiatives 
we also are  however  evaluating various strategic alternatives  which may include entering new lines of business or markets  exiting existing lines of business or markets and or disposing of assets depending on various factors  including changes in our business and regulatory environment  competitive position and financial resources 
we also continue to rationalize our operations to make sure that our ongoing business is profitable 
to the extent that we expand our current service territory or product offerings  we expect to generate additional revenues 
on the other hand  if we decide to exit certain markets  as we did during and early  our revenues could decrease 
we currently do not foresee large  one time opportunities to expand our business  such as prior efforts like the launch of pdps in and the privatization of georgia medicaid in we also intend to divert some resources to strengthening compliance and operating capabilities 
these factors  when combined with the rationalization of our operations and the operational challenges we face  could cause us to not sustain the rapid growth we have achieved in the recent past 
membership and trends we provide managed care services targeted exclusively to government sponsored health care programs  focused on medicaid and medicare  including prescription drug plans and health plans for families  children  and the aged  blind and disabled 
as of december   we served approximately  members 
most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
we currently anticipate that our revenues and medical benefits expenses for fiscal years will be higher than in prior periods due to the changes in the numbers and demographic mix of membership principally occurring in our medicare advantage plans and ohio medicaid market  and  effective in  in hawaii 
as the composition of our membership base continues to change as the result of programmatic  competitive  regulatory  benefit design  economic or other changes  we expect a corresponding change to our premium revenue  costs and margins  which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  profitability and results of operations 
in february  cms notified us that  effective march   we have been sanctioned through a suspension of marketing of  and enrollment into  all lines of our medicare business 
this suspension will remain in effect until cms determines that it should be lifted 
among other areas  cms s determination was based on findings of deficiencies in our enrollment and disenrollment operations  appeals and grievances  timely and proper responses to beneficiary complaints and requests for assistance and marketing and agent broker oversight activities 
we are working closely with cms to address their concerns 
at this time  we cannot estimate the duration of the suspension or the ultimate impact it will have on our results of operations and our business 
nonetheless  we anticipate that our inability to enroll new medicare members will have a material negative affect on our results of operations and 
table of contents business in and potentially beyond 
further  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to take appropriate corrective action or that  despite any corrective measures taken on our part  that we will not incur additional penalties  fines or other operating restrictions which could have an additional material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in response to the cms suspension in march  we made certain changes to our medicare marketing sales force and are continuing to assess the impact of suspending marketing activities and the resulting loss of membership to determine what effect  if any  this action will have on our staffing needs and other operational capabilities to effectively and efficiently meet the needs of the members we serve 
encounter data to the extent that our encounter data is inaccurate or incomplete  we may incur additional costs to collect or correct this data and could be exposed to regulatory risk for noncompliance 
the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards which are partly used by such states to set premium rates 
as states increase their reliance on encounter data  our inability to obtain complete and accurate encounter data could significantly affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and our ability to bid for  and continue to participate in  certain programs 
basis of presentation the consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  changes in stockholders and members equity and comprehensive income and cash flows include the accounts of the company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
our segments we have two reportable business segments medicaid and medicare 
medicaid medicaid was established to provide medical assistance to low income and disabled persons  and is state operated and implemented  although it is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments 
for a more detailed description of our medicaid segment  please see item business our segments 
as of december   we had approximately  medicaid members 
the following table summarizes our medicaid segment membership by line of business as of december  and medicaid membership as of december  medicaid tanf s chip ssi fhp total for purposes of our medicaid segment  we define our customer as the state and related governmental agencies that have common control over the contracts under which we operate in that particular state 
in and  we had two customers  the states of florida and georgia  from which we received or more of our medicaid segment premiums revenues 
medicare medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital  medical insurance and prescription drug benefits  and is administered and funded by cms 
for a more detailed description of our medicare segment  please see item business our segments 
as of december   we had approximately  medicare members 

table of contents medicare membership as of december  medicare pdp medicare advantage total in our medicare segment  we have just one customer  cms  from which we receive substantially all of our medicare segment premium revenue 
our health and prescription drug plans premiums we receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members who are assigned to us  or who have selected us to provide health care services under medicaid and medicare 
the premiums we receive under each of our government benefit plans are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period and we are generally unable to change the premium rates during the contract year 
the premiums we receive vary according to the specific government program and vary according to many factors  including the member s geographic location  age  gender  medical history or condition  or the services rendered to the member 
these premiums are subject to adjustment by our government clients throughout the term of the contract  although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract period 
the premium payments we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government 
as a result of these periodic premium rate adjustments and member eligibility determinations  we cannot predict with certainty what our future revenues will be under each of our government contracts even when we believe membership is remaining constant 
for further detail about the cms reimbursement methodology under the pdp program  see critical accounting policies below 
services coverage medicaid the medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve effectively our various constituencies in the communities we serve 
although our medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members  in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive 
our medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care 
in general  members are required to use our network  except in cases of emergencies  transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs  and generally must receive a referral from their primary care physician in order to receive health care from a specialist  such as an orthopedic surgeon or neurologist 
members do not pay any premiums  deductibles or co payments for most of our medicaid plans 
medicare through our medicare advantage plans  we also cover a wide spectrum of medical services 
we provide additional benefits not covered by original medicare  such as vision  dental and hearing services 
through these enhanced benefits  the out of pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced  which allows our members to better manage their health care costs 
most of our medicare advantage plans require members to pay a co payment  which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided 
typically  members of our ccps are required to use our network of providers except in cases such as emergencies  transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs 
ccp members may see an out of network specialist if they receive a referral from their pcp and may pay incremental cost sharing 
pffs plans are open access plans that allow members to be seen by any physician or facility that participates in the medicare program  is willing to bill us for reimbursement and accepts our terms and conditions 
our pilot ppo plans offer members the option to seek any services outside of our contracted network but  in such case  they are subject to higher cost sharing 
we also offer special needs plans to individuals who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid  or d snps  in most of our markets 
d snps are designed to provide specialized care and support for beneficiaries who are dually eligible for both medicare and medicaid 
we believe that our d snps are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs 

table of contents the medicare part d benefit  which provides prescription drug benefits  is available to medicare advantage enrollees as well as original medicare enrollees 
we offer part d coverage as stand alone pdps and as a component of many of our medicare advantage plans 
depending on medical coverage type  a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can either join a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
pffs beneficiaries can join a pffs plan that has part d drug coverage or join a plan without such coverage and choose either to obtain a drug benefit from a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in ccps or ppos can join a plan with part d coverage or forego part d coverage 
medical benefits expense our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide  which is based primarily on our arrangements with health care providers and utilization of health care services by our members 
our profitability depends on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive 
our arrangements with providers primarily fall into two broad categories capitation arrangements  pursuant to which we pay the capitated providers a fixed fee per member and fee for service as well as risk sharing arrangements  pursuant to which the provider assumes a portion of the risk of the cost of the health care provided 
other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management 
capitation payments represented and of our total medical benefits expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management 
estimation of medical benefits payable is our most significant critical accounting estimate 
see critical accounting policies below 
we use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense  including payment methods to providers  referral requirements  quality and disease management programs  reinsurance and member co payments and premiums for some of our medicare plans 
national health care costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate  however  relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in health care laws  regulations and practices  levels of use of health care services  competitive pressures  hospital costs  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively 
one of our primary tools for measuring profitability is our mbr  the ratio of our medical benefits expense to the premiums we receive 
changes in the mbr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of medicaid and medicare membership  our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported claims 
we use mbrs both to monitor our management of medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including what health care plans to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit and the selection of health care providers 
although mbrs play an important role in our business strategy  we may for example be willing to enter into new geographical markets and or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable mbr if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs and for other reasons 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition 
our medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
our medicare advantage and pdp contracts with cms generally have terms of one year 
we recognize premium revenues in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
we estimate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible or that will be returned based on historical trends  anticipated or actual mbrs  and other factors 
an allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible and a liability is established for premium expected to be returned 
the allowance has not been significant to premium revenue 
the payment we receive monthly from cms for our pdp program generally represents our bid amount for providing prescription drug insurance coverage 
we recognize premium revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract 
premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as unearned premiums in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amounts that have not been received by the end of the period remain on the balance sheet classified as premium receivables 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by our customers 
from time to time  the states or cms may require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received based on an eligibility list that a state or cms later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category  different program  or belong to a different plan other than ours 
these adjustments reflect changes in the number of and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was received 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate the estimates of retroactive adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information 
our government contracts establish monthly rates per member  but may have additional amounts due to us based on items such as age  working status or medical history 
for example  cms has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all medicare plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled 
cms transitioned to the risk adjustment model while the old demographic model was being phased out 
the demographic model based the monthly premiums paid to medicare plans on factors such as age  gender and disability status 
the monthly premium amount for each member was separately determined under both the risk adjustment and demographic model  and these separate payment amounts were blended according to a transition schedule 
the first year in which risk adjusted payment for health plans was fully phased in was the pdp payment methodology is based on the risk adjustment model which began in under the risk adjustment model  the settlement payment is based on each member s preceding year medical diagnosis data 
the final settlement payment amount under the risk adjustment model is made in august of the following year  allowing for the majority of medical claim run out 
as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment model  our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially  either favorably or unfavorably 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for medicare members with predictably higher costs 
under this risk adjustment methodology  diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us 
we collect claims and encounter data and submit the necessary diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we continually estimate risk adjusted revenues based upon membership claim activity and the diagnosis data submitted to cms  as well as the data which is ultimately accepted by cms  and record such adjustments in our results of operations 
however  due to the variability of the assumptions that we use in our estimates  our actual results may differ from the amounts that we have estimated 
if our estimates are materially incorrect  it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between the amounts that we have recorded and the revenues that we actually received 
other amounts included in this balance as a reduction of premium revenue represent the return of premium associated with certain of our medicaid contracts 
these contracts require the company to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense  and to the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical expense  we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical expense 
the company estimates the amounts due to the state as a return of premium each period based on the terms of the company s contract with the applicable state agency 
estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable 
the cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical benefits that have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
we contract with various health care providers for the provision of certain medical care services to our members and generally compensate those providers on a fee for service or capitated basis or pursuant to certain risk sharing arrangements 
capitation represents fixed payments generally on a pmpm basis to participating physicians and other medical specialists as compensation for providing comprehensive health care services 
generally  by the terms of most of our capitation agreements  capitation payments we make to capitated providers alleviate any further obligation we have to pay the capitated provider for the actual medical expenses of the member 
participating physician capitation payments for the years ended december   and were approximately  and of total medical benefits expense  respectively 

table of contents medical benefits expense has two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratory and pharmacy 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses 
medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated awaiting payment disbursement and estimates for ibnr 
the medical benefits payable estimate has been and continues to be the most significant estimate included in our financial statements 
we historically have used and continue to use a consistent methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable 
our policy is to record management s best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time 
this estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions  which vary by business segment 
these standard actuarial methodologies include using  among other factors  contractual requirements  historic utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefits changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns  maturity of lines of business and changes in membership 
the factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us 
for example  from to  we grew at a rapid pace  through the expansion of existing products and introduction of new products  such as part d and pffs  and entry into new geographic areas  such as georgia 
the ultimate claims payment amounts  patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset  since we  the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas 
standard accepted actuarial methodologies require the use of key assumptions consisting of trend and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions that would allow for this inherent variability 
this can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid 
conversely  during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature  we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience 
with more reliable data  we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts  therefore  we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid 
medical cost trends can be volatile and management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
in developing the estimate  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable  we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the pmpm costs for prior months  which costs have been estimated using completion factors  in order to estimate the pmpm costs for the most recent months 
we validate our estimates of the most recent pmpm costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must rely upon historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and growth of our membership in our trend assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee for service basis 
these considerations are aggregated in the trend in medical benefits expense 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
also included in medical benefits payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement  claims payment differences as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
we record reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant 

table of contents changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend 
differences in our financial statements between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability  which we refer to as prior period developments  are recorded in the period when such differences become known  and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting mbr in such periods

table of contents medical benefits payable recorded at december   and developed favorably by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the decreases in medical benefits payable are the amounts incurred related to prior years  related to  related to  and related to  which were primarily attributable to favorable development in our key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
intangible assets include provider networks  membership contracts  trademarks  non compete agreements  state contracts  licenses and permits 
our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to years 
during  we acquired of the stock of three companies through which we operate our medicare pffs business 
the purchase price allocated to intangible assets consisted of state licenses in the amount of million 
we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
we must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
based on the current general economic conditions and outlook  we performed an analysis of the underlying valuation of goodwill at december  based on the valuation performed  we determined that the goodwill associated with our medicare reporting unit was impaired 
the impairment to our medicare reporting unit was due to  among other things  the anticipated operating environment resulting from regulatory changes and new health care legislation  and the resulting effects on our future membership trends 
we recorded an expense of million to goodwill impairment  and a corresponding amount to goodwill to reflect its fair value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet

changes in the mbr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of medicaid and medicare membership  our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to ibnr claims 
we use mbrs both to monitor our management of medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including what health care plans to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit and the selection of health care providers 
although mbrs play an important role in our business strategy  we may be willing to enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable mbr if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs

our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus 
our regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of medical expenses  management fees to our non regulated third party administrator subsidiary the tpa and direct administrative costs which are not covered by the agreement with the tpa  such as selling expenses and legal costs 
we refer collectively to the cash and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as regulated cash and regulated investments  respectively

our non regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of administrative costs not charged to our regulated subsidiaries for corporate functions  including administrative services related to claims payment  member and provider services and information technology 
other primary uses include capital contributions made by our non regulated subsidiaries to our regulated subsidiaries and repayment of debt

on december   three of our florida regulated subsidiaries declared dividends to one of our non regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million  two of which were paid on december  and one of which was paid on january  as of december  we had unregulated cash of approximately million and unregulated investments of approximately million 
the proceeds from the intercompany dividends discussed above are reflected in our unregulated cash balances as of december  with the exception of the dividends received on january  our credit facility and significant near term cash requirements our senior secured credit facility with wachovia bank  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders  which has a term loan facility with an outstanding balance of approximately million as of december   is currently in default and subject to acceleration by the lenders and  absent acceleration by the lenders  will become due and payable on may  taking into account  among other things  the increase in our unregulated cash balances as a result of our receipt of the million in dividends described above  we currently expect that we will be able to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility when it becomes due 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that adverse developments will not arise that impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility when it becomes due 
in particular  the timing and amount of any potential resolution with the usao  the civil division  the oig and the state of florida is uncertain and could materially and adversely affect 
table of contents our ability to meet our near term obligations  including repayment of the outstanding balance under the credit facility 
also  our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility could be materially and adversely affected if  among other things  florida regulators were to require certain of our intercompany loan arrangements  which total approximately million  to be terminated 
additionally  one or more of our regulators could require one or more of our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators were to determine that such a requirement were in the interest of our members 
for example  a state regulator recently notified us that  in its view  notwithstanding a parental guarantee that has been in place since  we should contribute a total of approximately million in additional statutory capital to two of our hmos 
we are currently in discussions with the regulator to determine the necessity of a capital contribution  if any  into these regulated entities 
in addition  there may be other potential adverse developments that could impede our ability to repay in full the outstanding balance under the credit facility 
in addition to our senior secured credit facility  we have other significant near term cash requirements  principally costs associated with the ongoing investigations 
as of december   we had spent a cumulative amount of approximately million on administrative expenses associated with  or consequential to  the government and special committee investigations  including legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  employee recruitment and retention costs and similar expenses 
approximately million of these investigation related costs were incurred in and approximately million were incurred in we expect to continue incurring significant additional costs in as a result of the federal and state investigations and pending civil actions  including administrative expenses and costs necessary to improve our corporate governance and address other issues that were identified 
as noted elsewhere we accrued a liability in the amount of million in connection with the resolution of these matters which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have been reflected in our financial statements  however  the timing  term and conditions of such costs remain uncertain 
in addition  in  one of our non regulated subsidiaries borrowed million from two of our florida regulated subsidiaries through intercompany loan arrangements for the purpose of commencing a new business 
the borrowing subsidiary ultimately did not commence the new business and the borrowing subsidiary still holds approximately million  which we intend to use to the extent necessary to meet our general corporate obligations 
we currently do not intend to cause the loans to be repaid until at least september however  the florida regulators could require the regulated subsidiaries to terminate the intercompany loan arrangements  necessitating the borrowing subsidiary to repay in full the amount owed to the florida regulated subsidiaries 
if the borrowing subsidiary were required to repay the intercompany loans  or other restrictions were placed on the use of proceeds from such loans  our unregulated cash balance could be reduced by up to million plus any accrued interest 
initiatives to increase our unregulated cash we are pursuing financing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash 
some of these initiatives include  but are not limited to  seeking additional dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access available excess capital 
for example  as discussed above  on december   three of our florida regulated subsidiaries declared dividends to one of our non regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million  two of which were paid on december  and one of which was paid on january  we are currently considering other intercompany dividends to increase our unregulated cash balances 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that any other applicable state regulatory authorities will approve  to the extent such approvals are required  the payment of dividends to our non regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries 
in addition to dividends  our strategies include accessing the public and private debt and equity markets and potentially selling assets 
our ability to obtain financing has been and continues to be materially and negatively affected by a number of factors 
the recent turmoil in the credit markets  market volatility  the deterioration in the soundness of certain financial institutions and general adverse economic conditions have caused the cost of prospective debt financings to increase considerably 
these circumstances have materially adversely affected liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings unattractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
we also believe the uncertainty created by the ongoing state and federal investigations is affecting our ability to obtain financing 
in light of the current and evolving credit market crisis and the uncertainty created by the ongoing investigations  we may not be able to obtain financing 
even if we are able to obtain financing under these circumstances  the cost to us likely will be high and the terms and conditions likely will be onerous 
the required repayment of the outstanding balance due under our credit facility will materially reduce our outstanding cash balances unless we are able to refinance the debt 
auction rate securities as of december   all of our long term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  which carry investment grade credit ratings 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every seven   or days 
as of the date of this report  auctions have failed for million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven   or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non existent 
in addition  while all of our auction rate securities currently carry investment grade ratings  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities without significant loss  and we currently believe these securities are not impaired  primarily due to government guarantees or municipal bond insurance  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value 
the final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as years 
the weighted average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is years 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold our auction rate securities until market stability is restored with respect to these securities 

table of contents regulatory capital and restrictions on dividends and management fees each of our hmo subsidiaries is licensed in the markets in which it operates and is subject to the rules  regulations and oversight by the applicable state doi in the areas of licensing and solvency 
each of our health and prescription drug plans is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed  which describes our hmo s capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and business operations 
from time to time  each of our plans is selected to undergo periodic examinations and reviews by the applicable state to review our operational and financial assertions 
the plans that we operate generally must obtain approval from or provide notice to the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions  such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds or paying dividends to a related party  entering into other arrangements with related parties  and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an hmo  or any other change in control 
for purposes of these laws  in general  control commonly is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity 
each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum statutory net worth in an amount determined by statute or regulation and we may only invest in types of investments approved by the state 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  a statutory minimum  or rbc  requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic and are administered by the states 
as of december   our connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri  ohio and pffs operations are subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized company action level  or cal  which represents the amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of the required cal or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum net worth may change over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
for example  new york enacted regulations that increase the reserve requirement by over an eight year period 
in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members 
for example  our ohio hmo is required to maintain required statutory capital at an rbc level of of cal 
moreover  as we expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  such as the medicare private fee for service programs  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
in addition  our medicaid and s chip activities are regulated by each state s department of health or equivalent agency  and our medicare activities are regulated by cms 
these agencies typically require demonstration of the same capabilities mentioned above and perform periodic audits of performance  usually annually 
state enforcement authorities  including state attorneys general and medicaid fraud control units  have become increasingly active in recent years in their review and scrutiny of various sectors of the health care industry  including health insurers and managed care organizations 
we routinely respond to requests for information from these entities and  more generally  we endeavor to cooperate fully with all government agencies that regulate our business 
for a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings  see part item legal proceedings 
at december  and  all of our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents  money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and us government securities 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
however  a state regulator recently notified us that  in its view  notwithstanding a parental guarantee that has been in place since  two of our hmos should contribute a total of approximately million in additional statutory capital 
we are currently discussing this request with the regulator

debt and credit facilities credit agreement as discussed above  our senior secured credit facility with wachovia bank  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders  which has a term loan facility with an outstanding balance of approximately million as of december   is currently in default and subject to acceleration by the lenders and will  absent acceleration by the lenders  become due and payable on may  our senior secured credit facility also included a revolving credit facility that expired in may although we are not in payment default  we are in default of a number of covenants contained in the credit agreement including our failure to provide the lenders with audited financial statements  our budget and other requested information  and our inability to maintain certain leverage ratios  some of which cannot be cured prior to maturity of the senior secured credit facility such as our entry into intercompany loan transactions that were not effected in compliance with the credit agreement 
as of the date hereof  our payment obligations under the credit agreement have not been accelerated and the rate of interest has not been increased 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that such obligations will not be accelerated or the rate of interest increased in the future or that the lenders will not exercise other remedies for default 
the term loan is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of our non regulated entities  which includes the stock of our operating subsidiaries directly held by our non regulated entities

if we fail to pay any of our indebtedness when due  or if we breach any of the other covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness  it may result in additional events of default 
working capital as of december   our credit ratings were as follows agency outlook credit rating moody s rating under review possible downgrade ba standard poor s credit watch negative b consequently  if we seek to raise funds in capital markets transactions  our ability to do so will be limited to issuing additional non investment grade debt or issuing equity and or equity linked instruments 
we expect to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures during the next several years from our existing cash balances  our cash flow from operations  public offerings or other possible future capital markets transactions 
we have taken a number of steps to increase our internally generated cash flow  including reducing our health care expenses by  among other things  exiting from unprofitable markets and undertaking cost savings initiatives 
we also may be required to take additional actions to reduce our cash flow requirements  including the deferral of planned investments aimed at reducing our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the deferral or cancellation of any investments could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our short term business objectives 
we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments  and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes either through additional debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise as appropriate 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table below 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations

based on the current status of matters and all information known to us to date  in the year ended december  we recorded selling  general and administrative expense and accrued a liability in the amount of million in connection with the resolution of these matters  which is included in the other accrued expenses line item within our consolidated balance sheets as of december   and  respectively 
we believe that it is probable that the actual resolution amount for all such matters under review will be more than the amounts that have already been reflected in our financial statements  however  we cannot provide an estimable range of additional amounts  if any  nor can we provide assurances regarding the timing  terms and conditions of any potential negotiated resolution of pending investigations by the usao  the civil division  the oig or the state of florida 
accordingly  the amount has been excluded from the table above

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively 
at december   we had investments classified as long term in the amount of million 
we also had restricted investments of million and million  at december  and  respectively  which consist principally of restricted deposits in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months as well as longer term bonds with floating interest rates that are considered available for sale 
restricted assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and us treasury instruments deposited or pledged to state agencies in accordance with state rules and regulations 
these restricted assets are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements 
the investments classified as long term are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of their short term nature  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by less than million 
similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments by less than million
