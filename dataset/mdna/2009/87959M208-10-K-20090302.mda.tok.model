item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview telik is engaged in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs 
our business strategy is to advance telintra through phase clinical studies  and after obtaining clinical data  enter into a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to assist in further development and commercialization  advance our two leading preclinical drug candidates tlk and tlk into the clinic and seek a partnership for telcyta for further development 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses for the next several years as we continue our research and development activities 
during the year ended december   loss from operations was million and net loss was million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million and net cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments at december  were million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development and our research programs may require significant additional research and development expenditures  including for preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as for manufacturing development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval 
we outsource our clinical trials and our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  and from non equity payments from collaborative partners 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
in february  we implemented a restructuring plan to further reduce our operating expenses and to streamline our infrastructure to focus on our most advanced preclinical and clinical development programs 
as a result of the restructuring plan we reduced our workforce by positions and expect to record a charge of approximately million which primarily includes employee severance and related costs 
as a result of our restructuring plan  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until the end of changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the timing and extent of our research and development efforts and the outcome of our clinical trial activities 
the successful development of our products is uncertain 
as such  an accurate prediction of future operating results is difficult or impossible 
clinical product development telcyta  our first product candidate  is a small molecule cancer drug product candidate designed to be activated in cancer cells 
telcyta has shown clinical antitumor activity alone and in combination with 
table of contents standard chemotherapeutic agents in multiple phase clinical trials in refractory or resistant ovarian  non small cell lung  breast and colorectal cancer 
in addition  telcyta demonstrated clinical activity in two phase trials in combination regimens as first line treatment in patients with stage iiib or iv non small cell lung cancer 
we initiated four randomized phase registration trials in platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer and in platinum resistant non small cell lung cancer 
assist and assist were designed to evaluate telcyta in the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer 
assist was designed to evaluate telcyta in the treatment of advanced non small cell lung cancer 
in june  we reported that these trials did not achieve their primary endpoints 
assist  our fourth randomized phase trial  was initiated in may to evaluate telcyta in combination with pld versus pld alone as second line therapy in platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer 
on june   a full clinical hold for telcyta was initiated by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
as a result  we stopped enrolling new patients on the assist trial  and patients being treated on telcyta trials could not receive additional treatment until such time that the fda released the clinical hold 
on june  the fda converted the full clinical hold on telcyta to a partial hold  thereby enabling patients that had been enrolled in the trial the opportunity to continue to receive study treatments  subject to re consenting procedures 
on october   the fda completed its review of our telcyta data and removed the partial hold  permitting the resumption of telcyta clinical development 
although the initial trial design provided for the enrollment of patients no further patients were enrolled in the assist trial since the fda removal of the partial hold 
the study on the patients that had been enrolled prior to june has been completed and on october  we announced top line results demonstrating that statistically significant improvement was observed in a sub set of patients with platinum refractory or primary resistant disease 
we intend to seek a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to further advance the development and commercialization of telcyta 
telintra  our second drug product candidate in clinical development  is a small molecule glutathione analog inhibitor of the enzyme glutathione s transferase p we are developing telintra for the treatment of blood disorders associated with low blood cell levels  such as neutropenia or anemia 
in may  we initiated two phase clinical trials of telintra tablets  one for the treatment of patients with mds and the other for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia  or cin  in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer receiving first line chemotherapy 
both of these trials are randomized phase studies and are enrolling patients 
the trial for mds is intended to enroll patients and the trial for cin is intended to enroll patients 
pre clinical drug product development tlk cytotoxic small molecule tlk is a novel metabolically activated cytotoxic small molecule 
tlk induces apoptosis and g m  or cell division  cell cycle arrest in a broad array of human cancer cell lines including those not expressing gst p it has shown significant anti tumor activity in human breast  pancreatic  brain and colon tumors in pre clinical models of human cancer when administered either orally or by injection 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies that if successful may support the potential filing of an ind application with the fda 
tlk aurora kinase vegfr inhibitors we currently have a small molecule compound inhibiting both aurora kinase and vegfr kinase in pre clinical development 
aurora kinase is a signaling enzyme whose function is required for cancer cell division  while vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  or vegfr  plays a key role in tumor blood vessel formation  ensuring an adequate supply of nutrients to support tumor growth 
the lead compounds of our first 
table of contents dual inhibitor program met a development milestone in august by demonstrating anticancer activity in preclinical models of human colon cancer and human leukemia 
a development drug product candidate  tlk  has been selected 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies that if successful may support the potential filing of an ind application with the fda 
mcp antagonists c small molecule for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders mcp antagonists  including our lead compound c  is a small molecule that prevents leukocyte infiltration  a process linked to tissue injury in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis 
in february  we announced an agreement with sri international under which sri will fund and conduct preclinical studies of c in multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
we discovered all of our drug product candidates using our proprietary technology  trap  which we believe enables the rapid and efficient discovery of small molecule drug product candidates 
we expect to enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties  such as contract research organizations for clinical trials  development  manufacturing  regulatory approvals or commercialization of some of our products  particularly outside north america  or in disease areas requiring larger and longer clinical trials than cancer 
in august  we announced a license agreement with receptorbio  inc which would enable receptorbio to develop and commercialize our oral small molecule insulin receptor kinase activators 
these compounds were identified through the application of trap 
the agreement is contingent on receptorbio s reimbursement of telik s patent expenses 
it also provides for payments to telik related to regulatory milestones and royalties based on product sales or licensing fees  and will expire at the end of the royalty period 
our development focus does not currently include metabolic diseases like diabetes 
nasdaq stock listing compliance status on september   we received notification from nasdaq informing us that the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq global market under nasdaq marketplace rule a and giving us days to regain compliance 
nasdaq subsequently implemented temporary suspensions of the minimum bid price requirement 
we have until september  to regain compliance and are considering various strategies in order to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement 
ubs purchase rights and loan on november   we entered into an agreement with ubs ag and with its affiliates  or ubs  whereby we received rights the right to sell all our auction rate securities  or ars  held in our ubs account at par value to ubs at any time during a two year period beginning on june  and ending on july  if we do not exercise the right  the ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
if the right is not exercised on or before july   it will expire and ubs will have no further obligation to buy our ars 
ubs is also granted the right to purchase or sell our ars at any time after acceptance of the agreement until july   so long as we receive par value for the ars 
the right is a nontransferable security registered with the sec 
in connection with our acceptance of the offer to enter into the agreement  ubs has made available to us no net cost loans for up to of the market value of our ars  where interest payable on the loan does not exceed interest earned on our ars 
the loan is to be secured by our ars 
on december   we borrowed million from ubs in accordance with such a secured  no net cost demand facility 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted fas which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have currently adopted the provisions of fas with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of fas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fsp is applicable to the valuation of auction rate securities held by us for which there was no active market as of december  and is effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
fair value is defined under fas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under fas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 

table of contents stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted fas r  and used the fair value method to account for share based payment awards following the modified prospective method of adoption which provided for certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation 
under the provisions of fas r  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
our expected stock price volatility assumption for was based on historical volatility 
from january  to june   a blended rate of historical volatility and implied volatility was used since we had sufficient market activity existed with respect to our traded options during such period 
for the period from july  to december   the expected volatility was based solely on historical volatility as there was insufficient traded option activity due to adverse stock market conditions 
the expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimation 
sab was effective on january  and provided guidance to issuers on the method allowed in developing estimates of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sab amends sab allowing companies to continue using the simplified method  under certain circumstances  beyond december  fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we adjusted our forfeiture rate to reflect actual historical and expected cancellations of unvested options due to employee attrition 
we increased our forfeiture rates from in to in and to in see also note  stockholders equity  in the notes to financial statements for further information 
if factors change and we develop different assumptions in the application of fas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under fas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors  consultants and third party contract research organizations  and an allocation of facility and administrative costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the on going development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed during a given period of time over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with third party contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and third party service providers of the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services in each agreement 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the third party organizations as measured by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 

table of contents use of estimates in preparing our financial statements to conform with gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
results of operations revenues we had no collaborative research agreements in  and and currently do not expect to record any revenue in the next twelve months 
future non product revenues  if any  will depend upon the extent to which we enter into new collaborative research agreements and the amounts of payments relating to such agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
our research and development activities consist primarily of drug development  clinical supply manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates and preclinical studies 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 
the costs associated with research and preclinical and clinical development activities approximate the following years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages research and preclinical clinical development total research and development total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following reduction of approximately million as phase clinical trial study activities in our assist  assist  assist and assist were completed  corresponding decreased costs in our clinical drug supply manufacturing cost of approximately million  decreased costs of approximately million in connection with headcount reduction associated with reduced clinical activities  and lower stock based compensation expense of approximately million primarily due to complete vesting of higher value stock options granted in earlier periods 
total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following reduction of approximately million as study activities in our assist  assist  assist and phase clinical trials are near completion  partially offset by costs related to our assist clinical trial of approximately million  and 
table of contents corresponding decreased costs in our clinical drug supply manufacturing cost of approximately million 
reduction of approximately million associated with lower headcount as a result of our corporate restructuring and corresponding reduction in clinical activities  and lower stock based compensation expense of approximately million primarily due to higher estimated forfeiture rates used in to reflect the cancellation of unvested options for higher than estimated level of termination and complete vesting of stock options granted in earlier periods partially offset by expense associated with new stock options granted 
we expect total research and development expenditures to decrease in the next twelve months as we focus on the phase clinical trials of telintra tablets and preclinical studies on tlk and tlk traditionally  phase and pre clinical studies incur less expenses than phase studies due to comparative size of the studies 
specifically  we expect both clinical and manufacturing expenditures to be lower than previous years and the timing and the amount of these expenditures will depend on the progress of the telintra tablets phase clinical trials 
the following table summarizes our principal drug product candidate development initiatives related r d expenses years ended december  product in thousands telcyta telintra other total research and development expenses other constitutes research and development activities performed by our chemistry  biology  preclinical and quality assurance departments as these costs cannot be allocated to any individual project 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our on going investment in our research and development activities and  in particular  the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct initial human clinical trials for drug candidates  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate  and filing by company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a new drug application  or nda  for a product candidate to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in view of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these and other factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  or million in compared to the same period in was primarily due to approximately million associated with headcount reduction and related administrative expenses 
in addition  legal expenses decreased by approximately million primarily due to the completion of our class action lawsuit defense and reduced patent application expenses 
stock based compensation expense also decreased by approximately million primarily due to complete vesting of higher value stock options granted in earlier periods 
the decrease of  or  in compared to the same period in resulted from a decrease in stock based compensation expense of approximately million due to higher estimated forfeiture rates used in to reflect the cancellation of unvested options for higher than estimated level of termination and complete vesting of stock options granted in earlier periods partially offset by expense associated with new stock options granted 
in addition  expenses decreased by approximately  as a result of our corporate restructuring and lower administrative expenses 
the decrease in expense was partially offset by a million increase in legal expenses and other related costs primarily due to our securities class action lawsuit 
we expect future general and administrative expenses to be lower than the spending level as we undertake efforts to lower expenses 
restructuring costs years ended december  in thousands restructuring costs in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  for severance costs and health benefits charges relating to a workforce reduction of seven positions 
in february  we reduced our workforce by positions  or approximately of our workforce  and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance costs and other charges in the quarter ended march  interest income and interest expense years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income expense  net interest expense interest and other income expense  net of million  million and million for the years ended december   and resulted primarily from earnings on investments 
the decrease of approximately million in compared to the same period in was due to a million decrease in investment income as a result of lower investment cash balances and lower interest rates  an increase in write down expenses of approximately million for investments in ars due to changes in market conditions 
table of contents resulting in an other than temporary impairment which was offset by a gain of million from the ars right offered by ubs 
see discussion under liquidity and capital resources below 
the decrease in compared to was due to lower investment cash balance and included a write down expense of approximately  of three ars investments due to changes in market conditions resulting in an other than temporary impairment 
there was no interest expense for the year ended december  as our lease and loan obligations were fully paid off at december  interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and the increase in interest expense in compared to was due to interest associated with a buy out option on leased equipment 
liquidity and capital resources in millions  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash working capital current ratio year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources and uses of cash 
due to the significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  interest earned on investments and equipment lease financings 
at december  we had available cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including obligations of us government agencies  high grade corporate and municipal bonds  commercial paper  auction rate preferred securities and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
at december   million par value of our investment portfolio is invested in corporate and municipal notes investments with an auction reset feature auction rate certificates and auction preferred stock  collectively known as auction rate securities  or ars  through our investment manager ubs 
beginning in late  our securities invested in ars failed to settle in scheduled auctions due to liquidity crises 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not make the sale  but does not result in the securities going into default because the issuer continues to pay interest 
the interest rates may be reset to predetermined penalty or maximum rates based on mathematical formulas in accordance with each security s prospectus 
while we continue to earn interest on the ars  these investments are not liquid and their carrying amounts are impaired due to the adverse change in the corporate debt market 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
we have recorded these investments at an estimated fair value of million at december  in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs whereby we received the right to sell all our ars with par value of million held in our ubs account at par value to ubs at any time during a two year period beginning on june  and ending on july  if we do not exercise the right  the ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars 
table of contents if the auction process fails 
if the right is not exercised on or before july   it will expire and ubs will have no further obligation to buy our ars 
we expect to exercise our right to sell such securities to ubs 
ubs is also granted the right to purchase or sell our ars at any time after acceptance of the agreement until july   so long as we receive par value for the ars 
the value of the right of million largely offset the decline in fair value of the ars from par value 
in connection with our acceptance of the offer to enter into the agreement  ubs would also make available to us no net cost loans up to of the market value of our ars 
the no net cost loans must be repaid upon commencement of the exercise of the rights 
on december   we entered into a loan agreement with ubs and drew down million with our ars pledged as collateral 
the loan is treated as a no net cost loan as defined in the agreement  meaning that the loan will bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest paid or deemed paid to telik on the pledged ars such that the interest cost  net of interest received by us on the pledged ars  will be zero 
though the loan is payable on demand  if ubs should exercise its discretionary right to demand repayment of any portion of the loan prior to the date we can exercise our repurchase rights  ubs and certain of its affiliates will arrange for alternative financing on terms and conditions substantially the same as those contained in the loan  and if alternative financing cannot be established  then ubs or one of its affiliates will purchase our pledged ars at par 
ubs obligation to arrange such alternative financing does not apply under certain circumstances  including  but not limited to  if we sell the ars pledged as collateral 
proceeds of sales of our ars will first be applied to repayment of the credit line with the balance  if any  for our account 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations for was million compared with million in and million in net loss of million in included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  for depreciation and amortization and million for the write down of marketable securities and were partially offset by a gain of million recorded upon initial recognition of a put option associated with the ars rights with ubs 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to the completion of our assist   and clinical trials and a million reduction in accrued legal and related expenses primarily for amounts paid in connection with the class action lawsuit  partially offset by a decrease of  in interest receivables as a result of lower interest rates and investment balances and a  increase in accounts payable 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation and amortization and million for the write down of marketable securities 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to the near completion of our assist  and clinical trials and a million reduction in accounts payable 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation and million for depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operations in was further impacted by a decrease of million in accrued clinical trials expenses  primarily due to our phase clinical trials and a million decrease in accrued compensation expense primarily due to bonus payouts 
cash outflows in were offset by an increase of million in accrued liabilities related mainly to manufacturing expenses and million in accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for was million compared to million in and million in cash provided in was primarily from million in maturities of investments and million from sales of investments offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
cash provided in was primarily from million in maturities of investments and million from sales of investments partially offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
capital expenditures in were  primarily for laboratory equipment purchases 
cash provided in was primarily from million in sales and maturities of investments offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
capital expenditures in were  primarily for laboratory equipment  computer equipment and software purchases 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for was approximately million compared with  in and million in financing activities in comprised of million in loan proceeds from ubs and  in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases 
table of contents under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in were comprised primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by  in payments under capital leases and equipment loans 
financing activities for were comprised primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by  in payments under capital leases and equipment loans 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to our use of cash for operating expenses and our telcyta and telintra development programs 
as a result of our restructuring plan implemented in february  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until the end of changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing may subject us to restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our operations 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  the progress and number of research programs in development  the costs associated with conducting phase clinical trials  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish  and the scope of  any new collaborations  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  and competing technological and market developments 
we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
our future contractual obligations at december  are as follows total after in thousands operating leases we have a contractual obligation under the terms of our manufacturing supply agreement with organichem corporation  wherein we are obligated to purchase a majority of our united states requirements for the active ingredient in telcyta for a number of years 
however  we currently do not have any requirements for the active ingredient 
we have agreed on a pricing schedule for such supply  which will be subject to future renegotiation after a defined time period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk exposure involves forward looking statements 
we do not use or hold derivative financial instruments  however we are exposed to market risk related to changes interest rates and market conditions 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter maturities 
our marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities and commercial papers with an average maturity of under one year and a minimum investment grade rating of a or a or better to minimize credit risk 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio and beyond total fair value at december  in thousands  except percentages available for sale securities trading securities average interest rate trading securities are comprise of corporate  student loans and municipal notes investments with an auction reset feature auction rate certificates and auction preferred stock  collectively known as ars  held in our account with ubs 
as discussed previously  while we continue to earn interest on the ars  these investments are not liquid and their carrying amounts are impaired due to the adverse change in the debt market 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
as discussed previously  in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs whereby we received the right to sell all our ars held in our ubs account at par value to ubs at any time during a two year period beginning on june  and ending on july  we intend to exercise this right and recover par value of the ars 
the value of the right largely offset the decline in fair value of the ars 
however  ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
on december   we entered into a loan agreement with ubs and drew down million with our ars pledged as collateral 
the loan is treated as a no net cost loan as defined in the agreement  meaning that the loan will bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest paid or deemed paid to us on the pledged ars such that the interest cost  net of interest received by us on the pledged ars  will be zero
