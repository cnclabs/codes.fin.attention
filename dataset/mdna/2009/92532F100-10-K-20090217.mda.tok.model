item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases 
telaprevir  our lead drug candidate  is an oral hepatitis c protease inhibitor and one of the most advanced of a new class of antiviral treatments in clinical development that targets hcv infection 
telaprevir is being evaluated in a fully enrolled registration program focused on treatment na ve and treatment experienced patients with genotype hcv 
we currently intend to file a new drug application  or nda  for telaprevir in the united states in the second half of  assuming the successful completion of our ongoing phase clinical trials 
we also are developing  among other compounds  vx  a drug candidate for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis 
in the first half of  we expect to begin a registration program for vx that focuses on cf patients with the gd mutation in the gene responsible for cf 
we intend to continue investing in our research programs with the goal of adding to our pipeline promising drug candidates designed to address significant unmet medical needs and provide substantial benefits to patients 
business focus over the next several years  we expect to focus a substantial portion of our resources on the development and potential commercialization of telaprevir 
our clinical development program is designed to support registration by us of telaprevir in north america for treatment na ve and treatment experienced patients with genotype hcv  and by our collaborators  janssen  a johnson johnson company  and mitsubishi tanabe  in international markets 
in addition to conducting the clinical trials of telaprevir  we are continuing clinical development of our earlier stage hcv protease inhibitors  vx and vx  and are pursuing business development activities with third parties who have potentially complimentary therapies including polymerase inhibitors  other direct acting antivirals  and novel interferons 
in preparation for the potential commercial launch of telaprevir  we are building our drug development  supply chain management  commercialization and marketing organizations 
in the first half of  we expect to initiate a registration program for vx focused on patients with cf who have the gd mutation 
we also expect to continue the development of vx  an investigational corrector compound  for the treatment of cf patients with cftr gene mutations that lead to trafficking defects 
as a result  we expect that over the next several years we will need to substantially increase resources focused on the development of our cf drug candidates 
we plan to leverage the infrastructure that we are building in preparation for the launch of telaprevir to support the potential launch of vx in addition to the registration programs for telaprevir and vx  we plan to continue investing in our research programs and to develop drug candidates  alone or with third party collaborators  that have emerged from our research programs 
using our drug discovery capability  which integrates biology  pharmacology  biophysics  chemistry  automation and information technologies in a coordinated manner  we have identified and are developing  among other drug candidates telaprevir  vx and vx  two additional hcv protease inhibitors  vx and vx  and vx  a novel jak inhibitor that targets immune mediated inflammatory diseases 
drug discovery and clinical development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource intensive process  which may take to years or more 
throughout this entire process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  side effects  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product 
the toxicity characteristics and profile of drug candidates at varying dose levels administered for varying periods of time also are monitored and evaluated during the nonclinical and clinical development process 
most chemical compounds that 
table of contents are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development never become commercial products 
a drug candidate s failure to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes including  for example  the lack of sufficient efficacy against the disease target  the lack of acceptable absorption characteristics or other physical properties  difficulties in developing a cost effective manufacturing or formulation method or the discovery of toxicities or side effects that are unacceptable for the disease indication being treated or that adversely affect the competitive commercial profile of the drug candidate 
designing and coordinating large scale clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of drug candidates and to support the submission of an nda requires significant financial resources  along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and infrastructure 
prior to commencing a late stage clinical trial of any drug candidate  we must work collaboratively with regulatory authorities  including the fda  in order to identify the specific scientific issues that need to be addressed by the clinical trials in order to support continued development and approval of the drug candidate 
these discussions typically occur over a period of months and can result in significant changes to planned clinical trial designs or timelines 
in addition  even after agreement with respect to a clinical trial design has been reached  regulatory authorities may request additional clinical trials or changes to existing clinical trial protocols 
if the data from our ongoing clinical trials or nonclinical studies regarding the safety or efficacy of our drug candidates are not favorable  we may be forced to delay or terminate the clinical development program  which  particularly in the case of telaprevir  would materially harm our business 
further  even if we obtain marketing approvals from the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner  we cannot be sure that the drug will be commercially successful 
our investments are subject to the considerable risk that one or more of our drug candidates will not progress to product registration due to a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes 
we monitor the results of our clinical trials  discovery research and our nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our portfolio investments in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and is analyzed and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
although we believe that our development activities and the clinical trial data we have obtained to date have reduced the risks associated with obtaining marketing approval for telaprevir  we cannot be sure that our development of telaprevir will lead successfully to regulatory approval on a timely basis  or at all  or that obtaining regulatory approval will lead to commercial success 
with respect to our other drug candidates  we have more limited data from clinical trials and nonclinical studies and as a result it is difficult to predict which  if any  of these drug candidates will result in pharmaceuticals products 
drug candidates hcv telaprevir is being investigated in a registration program focused on patients with genotype hcv that includes advance  a phase clinical trial in treatment na ve patients  illuminate  a clinical trial in treatment na ve patients  and realize  a phase clinical trial in treatment experienced patients 
enrollment in advance  illuminate and realize was completed in october  december and february  respectively 
we currently intend to file an nda for telaprevir in the second half of  assuming the successful completion of our ongoing registration program 
in addition to the clinical trials in our registration program  we and our collaborators are conducting several additional clinical trials in order to evaluate twice daily dosing of telaprevir and the use of telaprevir for treatment of patients with other hcv genotypes 
we have completed two phase b clinical trials of telaprevir based combination therapy in patients with genotype hcv  which enrolled an aggregate of approximately treatment na ve patients and are referred to as prove and prove in the week telaprevir based treatment arms of prove and prove  and  respectively  of patients achieved an svr on an 
table of contents intent to treat basis 
in the control arms of prove and prove  and  respectively  of patients achieved an svr on an intent to treat basis 
we also are conducting prove  a phase b clinical trial in patients with genotype hcv who did not achieve an svr with a previous treatment with peg ifn and rbv 
in prove  of the patients in the week telaprevir based regimen had undetectable hcv rna weeks post treatment on an intent to treat basis 
the interim analyses of safety data from our phase clinical trials indicated that the most common adverse events  regardless of treatment assignment  were fatigue  rash  headache and nausea 
gastrointestinal disorders  skin adverse events  including rash and pruritus  and anemia were more frequent  and the rash more frequently severe  in the telaprevir arms than in the control arms over the dosing period 
mitsubishi tanabe has initiated registration trials of telaprevir in japan focused on evaluation of week telaprevir based treatment regimens  including peg ifn and rbv  in approximately patients with genotype hcv 
these trials include both treatment na ve patients and treatment experienced patients 
mitsubishi tanabe expects to have svr data from its phase clinical trials of telaprevir in mid in addition to telaprevir  we are continuing the development of vx and vx  additional hcv protease inhibitors and are pursuing business development activities with respect to potentially complimentary therapies including polymerase inhibitors  other direct acting antivirals  and novel interferons 
the successful development and commercialization of telaprevir is critical to the success of our business as currently conducted 
while we are devoting significant resources  time and attention to the development  potential regulatory approval and a successful commercial launch  all of these efforts involve significant scientific and execution risk and can be adversely affected by events  such as competitive activities and regulatory actions  outside our direct control 
cystic fibrosis in october  we completed a phase a clinical trial of vx in patients with cf 
patients in this phase a clinical trial had the gd mutation and received vx over day and day dosing periods 
the primary endpoint for this clinical trial was safety  and no serious adverse events attributable to vx were observed 
based on the promising lung function data from this phase a clinical trial  as measured by improvements in fev  the lung function test most commonly used to monitor cf disease progression  and based also on observed changes in biomarkers that seek to measure the activity of the cftr protein  we are working with regulatory authorities in north america and europe to finalize the design of a registration program for vx focused on patients with the gd mutation 
in  we conducted phase clinical trials of vx in healthy volunteers and we recently completed an escalating single dose pharmacokinetics and safety clinical trial of vx in patients with cf who carry the fdel mutation on at least one of the patient s two cftr alleles 
we plan to initiate a phase a  day clinical trial of vx in the first half of immune mediated inflammatory disease vx is a novel oral jak inhibitor that we believe has the potential to be used in multiple imid indications 
we have completed a phase clinical trial of vx we may seek to out license vx to fund and support other research and development investments 
commercialization in order to market telaprevir in north america  we intend to build a marketing organization and a specialized sales force  which will require substantial effort and significant management and financial resources 
while we intend to stage our commitments to the extent possible in consideration of the telaprevir development timeline  in order to support an effective launch we will need to make significant financial commitments to our marketing organization prior to receiving regulatory approval 

table of contents we believe that effectively marketing telaprevir will require a substantial effort to educate physicians and patients about telaprevir s profile  the potential for treatment experienced patients to achieve an svr if telaprevir is approved for that patient population  the risks of waiting to treat patients who have not yet received treatment  and the benefits of screening at risk patients to identify a larger percentage of the currently undiagnosed patient population 
to ensure appropriate third party reimbursement upon launch  we will need to engage in a dialogue with commercial health insurers  government payers such as state medicaid plans and the veteran s administration employers  pharmacies and hcv care providers with respect to the potential value of telaprevir based treatment regimens 
we believe that marketing vx  if it is approved for sale  will require a smaller than usual marketing and sales effort  because most patients with cf in the united states and in europe are already receiving specialized treatments for cf from a relatively small group of physicians and have been screened for the specific mutations that cause their disease 
manufacturing as we advance our proprietary drug candidates through clinical development toward commercialization  we will need to continue to build our supply chain resources and maintain our quality assurance resources 
we rely on an international network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our drug candidates for clinical trials  and we expect that we will continue to rely on these third parties to meet our commercial supply needs for those drugs  if they are approved for sale 
our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi step international endeavor in which we rely on third party contract manufacturers in asia for the supply of raw materials  and in the european union and the united states for the application of specific manufacturing processes for the conversion of raw materials into drug substance  and for conversion of drug substance into final dosage form 
establishing and managing this global supply chain requires significant financial commitments  experienced personnel and the creation or expansion of numerous third party contractual relationships 
we will require a supply of telaprevir for sale in north america if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval 
we have completed the technical development work for our commercial formulation of telaprevir  and we are manufacturing product  through our third party manufacturer network  to meet janssen s  mitsubishi tanabe s and our clinical supply needs 
we have established relationships with multiple third party manufacturers for the manufacture of a commercial supply of telaprevir and have completed contracts for our primary supply of drug substance and most raw materials 
we believe our continuing efforts to expand our relationships with third party manufacturers and oversee their activities will be important in order to support a timely and effective commercial launch  and consistent commercial supply  of telaprevir in subsequent years 
we are completing the transfer of technical information regarding the manufacture of telaprevir to janssen so that janssen will be able to manufacture telaprevir  if approved  for sale in janssen s territories and as a secondary source of drug substance for us 
we require vx for clinical trials in north america and europe  and will require a supply of vx for sale in north america and europe  if we obtain marketing approval 
we are manufacturing  through our third party manufacturer network  vx to meet our clinical supply needs and are focused on completing the technical development work and commercial formulation of vx over the next several years  we expect to expand our existing relationships with our third party manufacturers or establish new relationships with third party manufacturers  in order to establish a supply chain for vx and support the potential commercial launch and subsequent commercial supply of vx corporate collaborations corporate collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
under our agreement with janssen  we have retained exclusive commercial rights to telaprevir in north america  and we are leading the global clinical development program 
janssen 
table of contents agreed to be responsible for of the drug development costs under the development program for telaprevir in north america and the janssen territories  to pay us contingent milestone payments based on successful development  approval and launch of telaprevir  to be responsible for the commercialization of telaprevir outside of north america and the far east and to pay us royalties on any telaprevir product sales in its territories 
we also have a collaboration with mitsubushi tanabe with respect to the development of telaprevir in japan and other countries in the far east 
our pipeline also includes aurora kinase inhibitors that are being investigated by merck for oncology indications 
in the second quarter of  merck initiated a phase clinical trial of mk vx alone and in combination with docetaxel in patients with advanced and or refractory tumors 
in the third quarter of  merck selected additional aurora kinase inhibitors for possible development 
we will not have the resources for some time to develop and commercialize all drug candidates that emerge from our research group  and therefore we will need to rely on corporate collaborations for the development and commercialization of some or all of our new drug candidates 
historically  we have been successful in initiating and concluding productive collaborations  but we will need to continue to do so in the future  even though economic and competitive conditions may be different than in the past 
financing strategy at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which was an increase of million from million at december  this increase was the result of net proceeds of million from the sale in february of  shares of our common stock and million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as the notes  gross cash proceeds of million we received in may in connection with the sale of our right to receive future royalty payments arising from sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase under our agreement with glaxosmithkline  and net proceeds of million from the sale in september of  shares of our common stock 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash used to fund our operations during and the repayment of a million collaborator development loan in may as a result of the sale of future royalties under our license to glaxosmithkline  we will not receive future cash royalty payments related to hiv protease inhibitors 
we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to continue to incur losses at least until we obtain approval for and successfully commercialize a product  if we ever do 
therefore  we are dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our research and development operations  to create a commercial infrastructure  and to meet our overhead costs and long term contractual commitments and obligations 
to date  we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions  strategic collaborative agreements  proceeds from the disposition of assets  investment income and the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
we expect that we will need additional capital in order to complete the development and any commercialization of telaprevir and to continue the development of our other drug candidates  including vx we may raise additional capital from public offerings or private placements of our securities or other methods of financing 
we cannot be sure that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research  drug discovery or development programs  including clinical trials  incur significant cash exit costs  or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require that we relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or drug candidates 
as part of our strategy for managing our capital structure  we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues  privately negotiated transactions and market purchases  depending on market conditions and our perceived needs at the time 
we expect to continue pursuing a general financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional 
table of contents transactions with respect to our outstanding debt obligations  and the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
any such transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies  each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management  are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition  research and development expenses  restructuring expense  and stock based compensation expense 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in note b  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following nonrefundable  up front license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales 
in addition  we have sold our rights to receive future royalties from our hiv assets and have been recognizing revenues under this arrangement since may up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration agreements  including the million we received from janssen in  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur 
as a result  we often are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines for compounds being developed pursuant to a collaboration agreement 
because the drug development process is lengthy and our collaboration agreements typically cover activities over several years  this approach often has resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue into future periods 
in addition  because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  our estimates regarding the period of performance have changed in the past and may change in the future 
any change in our estimates could result in substantial changes to the period over which the revenues from an up front license fee are recognized 
milestones at the inception of each agreement that includes contingent milestone payments  we evaluate whether the contingencies underlying each milestone are substantive  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone  as well as the level of successful effort and investment required 
if we do not consider a milestone to be substantive  the revenues from the related milestone payment cannot be recognized when the milestone is achieved  but must be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining performance period 
all of the 
table of contents milestones that have been achieved under our janssen collaboration agreement during the three years ended december  have been considered substantive 
where a substantive milestones is achieved in a collaboration arrangement and the corresponding payment is reasonably assured  the payment is recognized as earned subject to specific policies applicable where we have obligations remaining after achievement of the milestone 
because the recognition of a substantive milestone under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
in the past  significant fluctuations in our revenues from milestone payments on a quarterly and annual basis have contributed to significant fluctuations in our collaborative revenues 
royalty revenues in may  we entered into a purchase agreement with fosamprenavir royalty  lp pursuant to which we sold  and fosamprenavir royalty purchased for a one time cash payment of million  our right to receive royalty payments  net of subroyalty amounts payable to a third party  arising from sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase under our agreement with glaxosmithkline 
we deferred the recognition of million of revenues in connection with this sale 
on may   we began recognizing these deferred revenues under the units of revenue method 
under this method  the amount of deferred revenues to be recognized as royalty revenues in each period is calculated by multiplying the following the net royalty payments due from glaxosmithkline to fosamprenavir royalty for the period by the ratio of the remaining revenues we received from the sale of our rights to hiv royalty payments that we have not yet recognized to the total estimated remaining net royalties that we expect glaxosmithkline to pay fosamprenavir royalty over the remaining term of the agreement 
estimating the total remaining net royalties that glaxosmithkline will pay to fosamprenavir royalty requires the use of subjective estimates and assumptions  including estimates regarding the size of the potential market for hiv protease inhibitors  the competitive position of lexiva telzir specifically and hiv protease inhibitors generally with respect to currently approved drugs and drugs that may be approved in the future and the pricing of lexiva telzir 
changes to our estimate of the total remaining net royalties that glaxosmithkline will pay to fosamprenavir royalty could have a material effect on the amount of royalty revenues we recognize in a particular period 
prior to may  royalty revenues typically were recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories and generally were recognized in the period the sales occurred 
we reconciled and adjusted for differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues in the quarter any differences become known 
these differences were not significant 
research and development expenses all research and development expenses  including amounts funded through research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  expenses associated with the commercial supply investment in telaprevir  which are considered research and development expenses due to telaprevir s stage of development  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
when third party service providers billing terms do not coincide with our period end  we are required to make estimates of the costs  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  contractual services and investment in commercial supply in telaprevir  incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 

table of contents we are incurring significant costs related to commercial supplies of telaprevir  which entered into phase development in the first quarter of after a drug candidate enters into phase clinical development  determining whether to continue to classify all of these costs as research and development expenses or to capitalize some of them as inventory involves significant judgments 
generally  inventory may be capitalized if it is probable that future revenues exceeding the costs of the inventory will be generated from the sale of the inventory 
while we believe that the development activities and clinical trial data to date have reduced the risks associated with obtaining marketing approval for telaprevir  because of the inherent risks of drug development for accounting purposes we are continuing to expense all of our costs related to commercial supplies of telaprevir 
to the extent that we continue to expense these costs as we continue development of telaprevir  we expect that if  and when  we receive marketing approval for telaprevir we will have significant commercial supplies of telaprevir available  the costs of which would have already been expensed 
a consequence of the application of this accounting policy is that during the initial period after the potential launch of telaprevir our cost of goods sold will exclude costs that previously had been expensed as research and development expenses in prior periods 
restructuring expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred 
the liability for accrued restructuring expense of million at december  is related to that portion of our facility in kendall square  cambridge  massachusetts that we are not occupying and do not intend to occupy 
this liability is calculated by applying our best estimate of the net amount of our ongoing obligation 
we use a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of this liability 
the probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  including contractual rental commitments  build out commitments and building operating costs  and estimates of income from subleases  based on the term and timing of the subleases 
we discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 
these cash flow estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management s assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time  even if all other factors remain unchanged 
our estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past  and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability 
the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
for example  we currently have two subleases for portions of the kendall square facility with remaining terms of two and four years  respectively  and we have made certain estimates and assumptions relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current subleases 
market variability may require adjustments to those assumptions in the future 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the kendall square lease is terminated or expires  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
stock based compensation expense we measure compensation cost of stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  including estimated forfeitures  and recognize that cost as an expense ratably over the employees service periods  which generally is the vesting period of the equity award  or the derived service period for awards with market conditions 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and shares purchased pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates concerning our stock price volatility  the rate of return of risk free investments  the expected term of the awards  and our anticipated dividends 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to exercise judgment to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  or if any of our estimates or assumptions prove incorrect  our results could be materially affected

table of contents revenues comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages royalty revenues collaborative and other research and development revenues total revenues our total revenues in recent periods have been comprised primarily of collaborative and other research and development revenues 
on a quarterly and annual basis our collaborative and other research and development revenues can fluctuate significantly  due to the timing of recognition of significant milestone payments and the level of net reimbursement we receive for our development programs 
our royalty revenues decreased significantly in due to the sale in the second quarter of of our right to receive future royalties related to sales of the hiv protease inhibitor lexiva telzir

during and  revenues derived from the janssen collaboration agreement consisted of development milestone payments recognized in the period  net reimbursements for development costs of telaprevir  and an amortized portion of the million up front payment we received in in  as compared to  a million increase in milestone revenues from janssen offset a decrease in our net reimbursements and other revenues from the janssen collaboration  resulting in a small increase in total revenues from janssen 
the million increase in milestone revenues from million in to million in was primarily the result of a million milestone that we achieved in the second quarter of for the enrollment of patients in our advance clinical trial 
the principal milestones remaining under our agreement with janssen relate to filing for marketing authorization for telaprevir with the european medicines evaluation agency and the launch of telaprevir in the european union  and as a result we expect our revenues from janssen to decrease in as compared to amounts that janssen pays us for reimbursement of our telaprevir clinical development expenses  after we offset reimbursement amounts owed to janssen for janssen s telaprevir clinical trial expenses  are recorded as revenues 
the decreased net reimbursements in as compared to were the result of lower reimbursable expenses related to telaprevir clinical trials incurred by us combined with increased reimbursable expenses incurred by janssen associated with the clinical trials  including realize  being led by tibotec 

table of contents the decrease in our total collaborative and other research and development revenues in as compared to was primarily attributable to decreased revenues from our collaboration with cfft

in addition  our revenues from milestones related to the merck collaboration decreased from million in to million in royalty revenues our royalty revenues relate to sales of the hiv protease inhibitors lexiva telzir and agenerase by glaxosmithkline 
until may   these royalty revenues were based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
on may   we sold our right to receive future royalties from glaxosmithkline with respect to these hiv protease inhibitors  excluding the portion allocated to pay a subroyalty on these net sales to a third party  in return for a one time cash payment of million 
we deferred the recognition of million of revenues from this sale 
we are recognizing these deferred revenues over the term of our agreement with glaxosmithkline under the units of revenue method 
we will continue to recognize royalty revenues equal to the amount of the third party subroyalty and an offsetting royalty expense for the third party subroyalty payment 
the million  or  decrease in royalty revenues in compared to resulted from this sale of our future hiv royalties in the second quarter of the million  or  increase in royalty revenues in as compared to was due to the increase in lexiva telzir net sales

development expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages development expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services commercial supply investment in telaprevir infrastructure costs total development expenses our development expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to this decrease in our development expenses was the result of a million decrease in commercial supply investment in telaprevir  which has fluctuated significantly quarter to quarter over the past two years  partially offset by increases in the other categories of development expenses  including expenses related to our increased headcount and infrastructure 
the varying levels of our investment in telaprevir commercial supply correspond with development timelines and estimated time to market and was significantly higher in as a result of the initial investment required to validate telaprevir manufacturing processes 

table of contents our development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to this significant increase in our development expenses was the result of increases in each category of development expense as we advanced telaprevir 
the most significant increase from to was in our commercial supply investment  which increased by million 
to date we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
in addition  the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase and phase clinical trials 
given the uncertainties related to development  we currently are unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenues and net cash inflows 
sales  general and administrative expenses comparison comparison in thousands in thousands  except percentages sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses increased substantially in each of and as compared to the preceding year as the result of increased headcount as we advance our drug candidates  particularly telaprevir  into late stage development 
royalty expenses royalty expenses increased million  or  in compared to  and by million  or  in compared to royalty expenses primarily relate to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
the subroyalty expense offsets a corresponding amount of royalty revenues 
we expect to continue to recognize this subroyalty as an expense in future periods 
restructuring expense as of december  our lease restructuring liability was million 
in  and  we recorded restructuring expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the restructuring expense in all periods included imputed interest cost related to the restructuring liability associated with our kendall square lease 
the decrease in restructuring expense for compared to and the increase in restructuring expense for as compared to was in each case primarily the result of a revision  in the first quarter of  of certain key estimates and assumptions about building operating costs for the remaining period of the lease commitment  for which there were no corresponding revisions in or we review our estimates and assumptions with respect to the kendall square lease on at least a quarterly basis  and will make whatever modifications we believe are necessary to reflect any changed circumstances  based on our best judgment  until the termination of the lease 
our estimates have 
table of contents changed in the past  and may change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of the liability  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
non operating items interest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is a result of lower portfolio yields during  partially offset by higher average levels of invested funds in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities yielded approximately on an annual basis in compared to approximately in interest income increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in was the result of higher levels of invested funds and higher portfolio yields during as compared to interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in this increase in as compared to resulted from the issuance in february of million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for from million for as a result of our reduction of outstanding debt in and in  we sold  shares of the common stock of altus pharmaceuticals  inc for million and warrants to purchase  shares of altus common stock for million  resulting in a realized gain of million 
in  we recorded a non cash loss on exchange of convertible subordinated notes of million in connection with our issuance of common stock in exchange for a portion of our convertible senior subordinated notes due february this loss corresponded to the value of additional shares issued in the transaction over the number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original terms 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r during  we recorded a million benefit from the cumulative effect of changing from recording forfeitures related to restricted stock awards as they occurred to estimating forfeitures during the service period 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and or development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  strategic sales of assets or businesses  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans 
we expect that we will require additional capital in order to commercialize telaprevir and continue our planned activities in other areas 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  which was an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily a result of the million of net proceeds from the offerings of common stock and notes that we completed in february  the proceeds we received from the sale of our hiv royalty stream in may  and the million of net proceeds from the september offering of common stock 
in addition  we received milestone and other payments from our collaborators and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefits plans 
these cash inflows were partially offset by cash expenditures we made in related to  among other things  research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses and the repayment in may of a million loan  which was outstanding under the loan facility established under our collaboration with novartis 
capital expenditures for property and equipment during were million 
at december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of our notes 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  and we are required to 
table of contents make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on february and august of each year 
the notes will mature on february  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into our common stock at a price equal to approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
on or after february   we may redeem the notes at our option  in whole or in part  at the redemption prices stated in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the redemption date 
our accrued restructuring expense of million at december  relates to the portion of the facility that we lease in kendall square that we do not intend to occupy and includes other related lease obligations  recorded at net present value 
in  we made cash payments of million against the accrued expense and received million in sublease rental payments 
during  we expect to make additional cash payments of million against the accrued expense and receive million in sublease rental payments 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in our development pipeline  particularly in clinical trials of telaprevir  in our effort to prepare for potential registration  regulatory approval and commercial launch of telaprevir  and in clinical trials for our other drug candidates  including vx we also expect to maintain our substantial investment in research 
as a result  we expect to incur future losses on a quarterly and annual basis 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  in addition to amounts we expect to receive from our collaborators under existing contractual obligations  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we expect that we will need additional capital in order to complete the development and commercialization of telaprevir and to continue the development of our other drug candidates  including vx we may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities  securing new collaborative agreements  or other methods of financing 
any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
we also will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research  drug discovery or development programs or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or drug candidates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the united states government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of our investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk
