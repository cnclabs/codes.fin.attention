we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or such factors 
general overview we report results in three segments the data group  the services group  and the marketing research group 
we believe that by organizing all of our businesses that sell proprietary content into a single segment  we can effectively deploy sales and marketing resources 
we also believe that this organization creates opportunities for cross selling proprietary databases under one brand name 
on june   we changed our company name from infousa inc to infogroup inc the company or infogroup or we 
we are a delaware corporation incorporated in our key strategic initiatives for include continuing our focus on improved corporate governance  including operating under our recently revamped formal policies  functioning under the guidance of our restructured majority independent board and working with our new management team 
continuing and expanding our initiatives of outreach  transparency and communications with our shareholders and the entire investment community 
accelerating our organic  profitable growth by leveraging our leadership position as a data provider across our subsidiaries  creating both internal and external strategic alliances to add value to new and existing customers  and capitalizing on our existing cross selling opportunities among subsidiaries 
we anticipate concentrating our efforts on these opportunities for internal growth  instead of pursuing revenue growth primarily through acquisitions 
reinvesting in the business to expand our product offerings  particularly in the integrated digital realm 
we plan to provide our customers new products and services  including more internet based and interactive marketing solutions 
improving our financial foundation  by taking costs out of the business without jeopardizing service to our customers  continuing to aggressively reduce our debt levels and leveraging our high margin products to increase profitability

the company also incurred million in charges during for the impairment  write down and loss on sale of assets of million  facility closure costs of million and severance costs associated with the restructuring of guideline and direct media of million and million  respectively 
mergers and acquisitions internal revenue growth is our primary objective 
however  we still pursue opportunities for strategic acquisitions when presented with appropriate opportunities 
as described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we acquired direct media  inc in  a provider of list brokerage and list management services  and the following entities in expresscopy 
com  a provider of printing and mailing services guideline  inc  a provider of customer business and market research and analysis nwc research  a provider of research services  seco financial  a provider of financial services industry marketing  and northwest research group  a provider of research services 
we work to integrate the operations of the acquired companies into existing operations as resources and business constraints permit 
due to recent and potential future acquisitions  future results of operations may vary from and may not be directly comparable to historical data 
summary of acquisitions through acquisitions  we have increased our presence in the consumer marketing information industry  greatly increased our ability to provide data processing and e mail marketing solutions  increased our presence in list management and list brokerage services and broadened our offerings of business and consumer marketing 
table of contents information 
additionally  most recently we have added research businesses to complement our existing services

we frequently evaluate the strategic opportunities available and intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of complementary products  technologies or businesses that we believe fit our business strategy 
in connection with future acquisitions  we expect that we will be required to incur additional acquisition related charges to operations 
associated with the acquisitions previously described  we recorded amortization expense on other purchased intangibles as summarized in the following table amounts in thousands fiscal year amount critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we have identified the following to be the most critical because they are the most important to our 
table of contents portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition and they require subjective or complex management judgments revenue recognition and related estimates of valuation allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and other allowances  database acquisition  development and maintenance expenses  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of prospect lists paper form or electronic  mailing labels  published directories  other sales lead products and dvd information products are recognized upon shipment 
these product sales are typically evidenced by a written purchase order or by credit card authorization 
list management revenue is recognized net of costs upon shipment of the list to the third party 
list brokerage revenue is recognized net of costs upon verification from third party of the actual list used and shipped 
list brokerage revenue is recognized on a net basis because the company acts as an agent or broker including performing services  in substance  as an agent or broker with compensation on a commission or fee basis 
data processing and e mail customer retention solution revenues are billed on a time and materials basis  with the recognition of revenue occurring as the services are rendered to the customer 
revenue from the licensing of the company s data to third parties and the sale of the company s subscription based products are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement  when the company commits to provide the customer either continuous data access ie access via the internet or updates of data files over a period of time 
licenses and subscriptions are evidenced by written contracts 
the company also licenses data to customers with no such commitments 
in those cases  the company recognizes revenue when the data is shipped to the customer  provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
services performed in the marketing research group vary from contract to contract and are not uniformly performed over the term of the arrangement 
revenues under fixed price contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis 
performance is based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs where the costs incurred represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures of contract performance  including survey design  data collection  survey analysis and presentation of deliverables to the client 
progress on a contract is matched against project costs and costs to complete on a periodic basis 
provision for estimated contract losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined 
customers are obligated to pay as services are performed  and in the event that a client cancels the contract  the client is responsible for payment for services performed through the date of cancellation 
revenues under cost reimbursement contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
applicable estimated profits are included in earnings in the proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs 
incentives  award fees or penalties related to performance are also considered in estimating revenues and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
revenues under time and materials contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
revenue for our retainer contracts are charged to customers on a fixed monthly subscription fee basis to access on demand business research services  and revenues are recognized ratably over the term of each subscription 
retainer fees are required to be paid in advance by customers on either a monthly  quarterly or annual basis  and all billed amounts relating to future periods are recorded as deferred revenue on the company s balance sheet 
revenue for our deposit contracts are charged to customers on a fixed annual fee basis  which entitles them to access any of the company s service offerings throughout the contract period  up to the total amount of the annual deposit fee 
since deposit account customers can spend their contract fee at any time within the annual contract period  deposit account revenues are only recognized within the contract period as services are actually provided to customers  with any unused deposit amounts recognized as revenue in the final month of the contract 
as with 
table of contents retainer fees  deposit contract fees are required to be paid in advance  primarily annually  and any billed amounts relating to future periods are recorded as deferred revenue on the company s balance sheet 
unbilled receivables are invoiced based upon the achievement of specific events as defined by each contract including deliverables  timetables and incurrence of certain costs 
unbilled receivables are classified as a current asset 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenses are included in revenues with corresponding costs incurred by the company included in cost of revenues 
the company assesses collectibility of revenues and the company s allowance for doubtful accounts based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from the company s customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to record the company s trade accounts receivable at estimated net realizable value 
if the company determines that collection of revenues are not reasonably assured at or prior to the delivery of the company s products  the company recognizes revenue upon the receipt of cash 
cash basis revenue recognition periodically occurs in those cases where the company sells or licenses its information products to a poorly capitalized company 
however  sales recognized on this basis are not a significant portion of the company s total revenues 
sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
database costs 
our database and production costs are generally charged to expense as incurred and relate principally to maintaining  verifying and updating our databases  fulfilling customer orders and the production of dvd titles 
costs to develop new databases are capitalized and amortized upon the successful completion of the databases  over a period ranging from one to five years 
our cost of maintaining consumer and business databases does not necessarily vary directly with revenues since a significant portion of the cost is the maintenance and verification of our existing data 
consequently  operating income may vary significantly with changes in revenue from period to period  as our ability to adjust certain elements of our cost structure is limited in the short run 
because we expense the costs of maintaining and verifying our existing database  we believe that our balance sheet does not include an asset for the value of our database 
we believe that our databases of consumer and business information are valuable intellectual property assets 
our success in marketing our products and services depends  in large part  on our ability to maintain an accurate and reliable database of business and consumer information 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  included the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure impairment based on estimated fair value of the assets 
net property and equipment  net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  impairment of goodwill the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to not be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step is essentially a purchase 
table of contents price allocation exercise  which allocates the newly determined fair value of the reporting unit to the assets 
for purposes of the allocation  the fair values of all assets  including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets  are determined 
the residual goodwill value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the impairment charge 
we completed a goodwill impairment test as of october  and  respectively 
additionally  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed during the fourth quarter of  which required us to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test as of december  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization due to an overall decline in economic conditions 
at december   we had three reporting units that had goodwill and therefore required testing pursuant to sfas the three reporting units represent the company s reporting segments 
we considered both the income approach and the market approach in assessing the fair value of each reporting unit 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors  including revenue and market growth  operating cash flows  and discount rates 
as a result of the deterioration of the economic conditions in the united states in the second half of  the projections used took into account current economic factors and the effect on future revenue and operating income 
we used the gordon growth model to calculate residual values 
the gordon growth model refers to the concept of taking the residual year cash flow and determining the value of a growing  perpetual annuity 
the long term growth rate used for each reporting unit ranged between and 
the company used weighted average costs of capital ranging between and in its discounted cash flows analyses 
under the market approach  several relative pricing measures for comparable companies are examined to determine a fair value for each reporting unit 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting units under both approaches as of december   october  and october  exceeded its carrying amount 
thus  the goodwill of these reporting units was not impaired 
future adverse changes in expected operating results and or unfavorable changes in other economic factors used to estimate fair values could result in non cash impairment charges in future periods under sfas impairment of intangible and other assets we assessed the impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets as of december  as required pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
as a result of the declining profitability of expresscopy 
com  seco financial and infouk  recoverability tests were performed for these asset groups 
these tests included comparisons of undiscounted cash flows to the current carrying values of the each asset group 
since the carrying values exceeded the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment was recognized and allocated between all long lived assets within each asset group 
impairments for the year ended december  for expresscopy 
com  seco financial and infouk were million  which included million for impairments of property and equipment  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company recorded an impairment of million for a onesource database and million for development costs for a salesgenie product no longer being utilized 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but would not be limited to  the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause us to incur tax liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pretax income could impact our overall effective tax rate 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than 
table of contents not to be realized 
although we have considered future taxable income along with prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period any such determination was made 
likewise  in the event we were able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period any such determination was made
