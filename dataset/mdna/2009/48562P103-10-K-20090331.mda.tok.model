critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
kapstone believes its most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
sales with terms designated fob free on board shipping point are recognized at the time of shipment 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s site and when title and risk of loss are transferred 
sales on consignment are recognized in revenue at the earlier of the month that the goods are consumed or after a period of time subsequent to receipt by the customer as specified by contract 
table of contents terms 
incentive rebates are typically paid in cash and are netted against revenue on an accrual basis as qualifying purchases are made by the customer to earn and thereby retain the rebate 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of shaft horsepower  generated by its cogeneration facility  on a gross basis and within net sales

 the company tests for goodwill impairment annually using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company s reporting units are consistent with its operating segments 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the forecast and long term business plans of each operating segment 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units 
if necessary  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the company s goodwill impairment analysis is performed annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
however  as a result of the dramatic change in the economic and market conditions in the fourth quarter of  including the change in the company s stock price as compared to its book value per share and the significant disruptions in the global credit markets  the company performed an interim impairment test for goodwill as of the fiscal year end the company s annual and interim impairment tests did not result in an impairment charge for goodwill in the years presented 
pension and postretirement benefits kapstone provides pension and postretirement benefits to certain employees 
for financial reporting purposes  long term assumptions are developed through consultations with actuaries 
such assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates  health care trend rates and mortality rates 
the discount rate for the current year is based on long term high quality bond rates
