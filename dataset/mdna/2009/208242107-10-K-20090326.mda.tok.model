general we intend the following discussion and analysis to provide you with a better understanding of our financial condition and performance in the indicated periods  including an analysis of those key factors that contributed to our financial condition and performance and that are  or are expected to be  the key drivers of our business 
through our retail stores  we provide products and services to our customers in seven primary market areas  including houston  san antonio austin  dallas fort worth  southern louisiana  southeast and south texas and oklahoma 
products and services offered through retail sales outlets include home appliances  consumer electronics  home office equipment  lawn and garden products  mattresses  furniture  service maintenance agreements  customer credit programs  including installment and revolving credit account programs  and various credit insurance products 
these activities are supported through our extensive service  warehouse and distribution system 
our stores bear the conn s name  after our founder s family  and deliver the same products and services to our customers 
all of our stores follow the same procedures and methods in managing their operations 
the company s management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the operating results of the retail stores and considers the credit programs  service contracts and distribution system to be an integral part of the company s retail operations 
presented below is a diagram setting forth our five cornerstones which represent  in our view  the five components of our sales goal strong merchandising systems  flexible credit options for our customers  an extensive warehousing and distribution system  a service system to support our customers needs during and beyond the product warranty periods  and our uniquely  well trained employees in each area 
each of these systems combine to create a nuts and bolts support system for our customers needs and desires 
each of these systems is discussed at length in the business section of this report 
merchadising credit distribution service training drive sales we  of course  derive the majority of our revenues from our product and service maintenance agreement sales 
however  unlike many of our competitors  we provide in house credit options for our customers product purchases 
in the last three years  we have financed  on average  approximately of our retail sales through these programs 
in turn  we finance substantially all of our customer receivables from these credit options through a revolving credit facility and an asset backed securitization facility 
see business finance operations for a detailed discussion of our in house credit programs and our sources of funding 
as part of our asset backed securitization facility  we have created a qualifying special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue medium term and variable funding notes secured by the receivables to finance its acquisition of the receivables 
we transfer eligible receivables  consisting of retail installment and revolving account receivables extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated securities 
customer receivables funded by our revolving credit facility are retained on our consolidated balance sheet 
while our warehouse and distribution system does not directly generate revenues  other than the fees paid by our customers for delivery and installation of the products to their homes  it is our extra  value added program that our existing customers have come to rely on  and our new customers are hopefully sufficiently impressed with to become repeat customers 
we derive revenues from our repair services on the products we sell 
additionally  acting as an agent for unaffiliated companies  we sell credit insurance to protect our customers from credit losses due to death  disability  involuntary unemployment and damage to the products they have purchased  to the extent they do not already have it 
executive overview this overview is intended to provide an executive level overview of our operations for our fiscal year ended january  a detailed explanation of the changes in our operations for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the prior year is included beginning under results of operations 
our performance during fiscal was impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike  which made landfall along the gulf coast during september  and negatively effected our sales and credit portfolio performance 
following are significant financial items in management s view o our revenues for the fiscal year ended january   increased by  or million  from fiscal year  to million due primarily to product sales growth which drove higher service maintenance agreement commissions 
the growth in our total revenues was partially offset by a higher non cash decrease in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets  which totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the fair value adjustments in both periods were driven primarily by the volatile financial market conditions and were not a reflection of the performance of the sold receivables portfolio 
our same store sales growth rate for the fiscal year ended january   was  versus for fiscal additionally  total and same store sales were negatively effected in fiscal as a result of store days lost due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
o the addition of stores in our existing dallas fort worth  houston  southeast and south texas markets and the opening of three stores in oklahoma had a positive impact on our revenues 
we achieved approximately million of increases in product sales and service maintenance agreement sma commissions for the year ended january   from the opening of fourteen new stores in these markets since february we have additional sites under consideration for future development and continue to evaluate our store opening plans for future periods  in light of capital availability 
o deferred interest and same as cash plans continue to be an important part of our sales promotion plans and are utilized to provide a wide variety of financing to enable us to appeal to a broader customer base 
for the fiscal year ended january   million  or  of our product sales were financed by deferred interest and same as cash plans 
we have been able to reduce the volume of promotional credit as a percent of product sales  as compared to the prior year 
for the comparable period in the prior year  product sales financed by deferred interest and same as cash sales were million  or 
our promotional credit programs same as cash and deferred interest programs  which require monthly payments  are reserved for our highest credit quality customers  thereby reducing the overall risk in the portfolio  and are used primarily to finance sales of our highest margin products 
we expect to continue to offer extended term promotional credit in the future 
o our gross margin was for fiscal  a decrease from in fiscal  primarily as a result of the million reduction in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets in fiscal  as compared to the million reduction in the prior year  and reduced gross margin realized on product sales from in the year ended january   to in fiscal year the fair value adjustments to our interest in securitized assets accounted for basis points of the decline in total gross margin 
the product gross margins were negatively impacted by a highly price competitive retail market 
o our operating margin decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal  primarily as a result of the million reduction in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets in fiscal  as compared to the million reduction in the prior year 
the fair value adjustments to our interest in securitized assets accounted for basis points of the decline in operating margin 
o in fiscal  sg a expense as a percent of revenues decreased to from when compared to the prior year  primarily from decreases in payroll and payroll related expenses as a percent of revenues  as well as reduced advertising expenditures as a percent of revenues 
the decrease in our sg a expense as a percent of revenues was negatively affected by the negative impact of the fair value adjustment on total revenues  with the decrease shown above being reduced by basis points due to the negative impact of the fair value adjustments on total revenues 
additionally  reductions in certain store operating expenses  including repairs and maintenance and janitorial services contributed to the improvement 
partially offsetting these improvements were increases in utilities  credit data processing and hurricane related expenses of million 
o the provision for bad debts increased to million in fiscal  from million in the prior year 
this increase is due to an increase in the balance of customer receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet  as expected  after the completion of our asset based revolving credit facility in august  and is not the result of higher actual or expected net credit charge offs on the retained receivables 
as opposed to our interests in the customer receivables transferred to the qspe  which we account for at fair value  we are required to record a reserve for estimated future net credit losses for receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet  which we estimated to be million  based on our historical loss trends 
o net interest income expense has changed from reflecting net interest income in fiscal to net interest expense in fiscal  due primarily to the increase in customer receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet 
as a result  we have used previously invested cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the growth in customer receivables retained 
o other income expense declined million from fiscal to fiscal  due to gains recognized on the sales of two properties in fiscal o the provision for income taxes was impacted primarily by the effect of the non cash fair value adjustments on taxes for the state of texas  which are based on gross margin  instead of income before taxes 
o our pretax income for fiscal decreased by  or approximately million  from fiscal the decrease was driven primarily by the million non cash reduction in the fair value of our interest in securitized assets recorded in fiscal  which was million greater than the million non cash fair value adjustment recorded in the prior year 
o cash flows used in operations was million during fiscal due primarily to the increased retention of customer receivables on the our consolidated balance sheet 
prior to the completion of the revolving asset based revolving credit facility in august  virtually all customer receivables were transferred to and funded by our qspe  resulting in the net cash flow activity from these transactions being reported in cash flows from operating activities 
however  for customer receivables retained on our consolidated balance sheet and funded by our revolving credit facility  the increase in accounts receivable is reflected as a use of cash in cash flows from operating activities  and borrowings on our revolving credit facility are reflected in cash flows from financing activities 
operational changes and outlook we have implemented  continued increased focus on  or modified several initiatives in fiscal that we believe will positively impact our future operating results  including o increased promotion of flat panel technology in our stores as the price point becomes more affordable for our customers  and o increased emphasis on the sale of small electronics  including video game equipment and gps devices  and o increased emphasis on the sales of furniture  and additional product lines added to this category  and o a thorough review of our staffing and cost structure to ensure we are effectively leveraging the infrastructure in place and that it is sufficient to support our growth plans 
during the year  we opened one new store in the houston market  two in the dallas fort worth market  one in mcallen  texas  one in lufkin  texas and two in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
the dallas fort worth market continues to perform at the mid point of our range of expectations and we believe we have significant upside potential in that market through growth in the existing stores and our intention to continue to expand the number of stores in that market 
we have additional sites under consideration for future development and continue to evaluate our store opening plans for future periods  in light of capital availability 
we believe we have benefited and will continue to benefit from the recent closure of one of our major consumer electronics competitors  circuit city 
because of the success of their liquidation sale during february and early march  the growth of our total product and service maintenance agreement sales has slowed from the pace experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe that their closure will bring new customers into our stores  which could change the mix of our product sales and amount of credit we grant in relation to total product sales 
combined with changes we made to tighten our underwriting criteria and increase required down payments  we have seen a reduction in the amount of credit granted as a percentage of sales in recent months 
additionally  as a result of these changes  we have seen the mix between the primary and secondary receivables portfolios shift to a greater proportion of the receivables being in the higher quality primary portfolio over the past two quarters 
while we have benefited recently from our operations being concentrated in the texas  louisiana and oklahoma region  recent turmoil in the national economy  including instability in the financial markets  declining consumer confidence and falling oil prices will present significant challenges to our operations in the coming quarters 
specifically  future sales volumes  gross profit margins and credit portfolio performance could be negatively impacted  and thus impact our overall profitability and liquidity 
as a result  while we will strive to grow our market share  maintain consistent credit portfolio performance and reduce expenses  we will also work to maintain our access to the liquidity necessary to maintain our operations through these challenging times 
the consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive same store sales increases 
typically  these new products  such as lcd  plasma and dlp televisions  blu ray players  digital cameras  gps devices and mp players are introduced at relatively high price points that are then gradually reduced as the product becomes more mainstream 
to sustain positive same store sales growth  unit sales must increase at a rate greater than the decline in product prices 
the affordability of the product helps drive the unit sales growth 
however  as a result of relatively short product life cycles in the consumer electronics industry  which limit the amount of time available for sales volume to increase  combined with rapid price erosion in the industry  retailers are challenged to maintain overall gross margin levels and positive same store sales 
this has historically been our experience  and we continue to adjust our marketing strategies to address this challenge through the introduction of new product categories and new products within our existing categories 
over the past year  our gross margins have been negatively impacted by price competition on flat panel televisions 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as of january  transfers of financial assets 
we transfer eligible customer receivables to a qspe that issues asset backed securities to third party lenders using these accounts as collateral  and we continue to service these accounts after the transfer 
we recognize the sale of these accounts when we relinquish control of the transferred financial asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
as we transfer the accounts we record an asset representing the fair value of our interest in the cash flows of the qspe  which is the difference between the interest earned on customer accounts and the cost associated with financing and servicing the transferred accounts  including an estimate of future net credit losses associated with the transferred accounts  plus our retained interest in the transferred receivables  discounted using a return that we estimate would be expected by a third party investor 
we recognize the income from our interest in these transferred accounts as gains on the transfer of the asset  interest income and servicing fees 
this income is recorded as finance charges and other in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  changes in the fair value of our interest are recorded in finance charges and other 
we value our interest in the cash flows of the qspe at fair value under the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  and sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
we estimate the fair value of our interests in securitized assets using a discounted cash flow model with most of the inputs used being unobservable inputs 
the primary unobservable inputs  which are derived principally from our historical experience  with input from our investment bankers and financial advisors  include the estimated portfolio yield  net credit loss rate  discount rate  payment rate and delinquency rate and reflect our judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value 
in determining the cost of borrowings  we use current actual borrowing rates  and adjust them  as appropriate  using interest rate futures data from market sources to project interest rates over time 
changes in the assumptions over time  including varying credit portfolio performance  market interest rate changes  market participant risk premiums required  or a shift in the mix of funding sources  could result in significant volatility in the fair value of the interest in securitized assets  and thus our earnings 
during the twelve months ended january   risk premiums required by market participants on many investments increased as a result of continued volatility in the financial markets 
though we do not anticipate any significant variation in the underlying economics or expected cash flow performance of our securitized credit portfolio  we increased the risk premium included in the discount rate assumption used in the determination of the fair value of our interests in securitized assets to reflect the higher expected risk premiums included in investment returns we believe a market participant would require if purchasing our interests 
based on a review of the changes in market risk premiums during the three months ended april   and discussions with our investment bankers and financial advisors  we estimated that a market participant would require an approximately basis point increase in the required risk premium 
after our review for the three months ended october   we estimated that a market participant would require an additional basis point increase in the required risk premium 
at the completion of our review for the three months ended january   we estimated that a market participant would require an increase in the required risk premium of approximately basis points  resulting in a weighted average discount rate of at january   as compared to the weighted average discount rate assumption used at january  the increase in the discount rate has the effect of deferring income to future periods  but not permanently reducing securitization income or our earnings  assuming no significant variation in the future cash flow performance of the securitized credit portfolio 
additionally  during the three months ended october   as a result of the impact of general economic conditions on other consumer credit portfolios and the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike on our expected net charge off rate  we increased the weighted average net charge off rate input that we expect a market participant would use form to 
if a market participant were to require a discount rate that is higher than we estimated in the fair value calculation  the fair value of our interests in securitized assets would be decreased by an additional million as of january  if we had assumed a reduction in net interest spread which might be caused by rising interest rates or reductions in rates charged on the accounts transferred  our interests in securitized assets and finance charges and other would have been reduced by million as of january  if the assumption used for estimating credit losses was increased by  the impact to finance charges and other would have been a reduction in revenues and pretax income of million as of january  revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the product 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services and discounts of promotional credit sales that will extend beyond one year 
we sell service maintenance agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligors on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  at the time that they are earned 
where we sell service maintenance renewal agreements in which we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract at the time of sale  revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the term of the service maintenance agreement 
these service maintenance agreements are renewal contracts that provide our customers protection against product repair costs arising after the expiration of the manufacturer s warranty and the third party obligor contracts 
these agreements typically range from months to months 
these agreements are separate units of accounting under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amounts of service maintenance renewal agreement revenues deferred at january  and were million and million  respectively  and are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts of service maintenance agreement revenue recognized for the fiscal years ended january   and were million  million and million  respectively 
vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates earned upon purchase or sale of product  marketing  training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost or advertising expense  according to the nature of the program 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost  if the programs are related to product sales  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold  if the programs are directly related to promotion or marketing of the product  the allowances  credits  or payments are recorded as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the expense is incurred 
we received million  million and million in vendor allowances during the fiscal year ended january   and  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  represented advertising assistance allowances 
over the past three years we have received funds from approximately vendors  with the terms of the programs ranging between one month and one year 
goodwill 
we perform an assessment annually testing for the impairment of goodwill  or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
while the current market conditions have caused our market capitalization to fall below our book value  based on our annual assessment completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we do not believe our goodwill balance is impaired  supported by our recent and expected growth and profitability 
our conclusion was based on the fact that the decline in the market capitalization below book value has been recent and relatively short term  and the market price of our stock has risen since the low point reached in early december to support our conclusion we completed a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the company and compared those results with value indicated by other data available 
we used a discount rate in the analysis  and that rate could be increased basis points before it would result in a value that indicates that goodwill may be impaired 
accounting for leases 
the accounting for leases is governed primarily by sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
as required by the standard  we analyze each lease  at its inception and any subsequent renewal  to determine whether it should be accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
additionally  monthly lease expense for each operating lease is calculated as the average of all payments required under the minimum lease term  including rent escalations 
generally  the minimum lease term begins with the date we take possession of the property and ends on the last day of the minimum lease term  and includes all rent holidays  but excludes renewal terms that are at our option 
any tenant improvement allowances received are deferred and amortized into income as a reduction of lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
the amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements 
for transactions that qualify for treatment as a sale leaseback  any gain or loss is deferred and amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
any deferred gain would be included in deferred gain on sale of property and any deferred loss would be included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
receivables not sold 
accounts receivable not eligible for inclusion in the securitization program are carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet in customer accounts receivable 
the company records the amount of principal on those receivables that is expected to be collected within the next twelve months in current assets on its consolidated balance sheet 
those amounts expected to be collected after months are included in non current assets 
typically  a receivable is considered delinquent if a payment has not been received on the scheduled due date 
generally  an account that is delinquent more than days and for which no payment has been received in the past seven months will be charged off against the allowance and interest accrued subsequent to the last payment will be reversed 
interest income is accrued using the rule of s method for installment contracts and the simple interest method for revolving charge accounts  and is reflected in finance charges and other 
typically  interest income is accrued until the contract or account is paid off or charged off and we provide an allowance for uncollectible interest 
interest income is recognized on our same as cash promotion accounts based on our historical experience related to customers that fail to satisfy the requirements of the interest free programs 
the company has a secured interest in the merchandise financed by these receivables and therefore has the opportunity to recover a portion of the charged off value 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our customer accounts receivable  based on our historical loss experience 
the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and uncollectible interest for customer receivables was million and million  at january  and  respectively 
if the historical loss rate used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts were increased by at january   we would have increased our provision for bad debts by million

del change dollars in millions net sales finance charges and other net decrease in fair value revenues del 
the million increase in net sales was made up of the following o a million increase resulted from a same store sales increase of  o a million increase generated by fourteen retail locations that were not open for twelve consecutive months in each period  o a million increase resulted from a decrease in discounts on promotional credit sales  and o a million decrease resulted from a decrease in service revenues 
the components of the million increase in net sales were a million increase in product sales and an million net increase in service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues 
the million increase in product sales resulted from the following o approximately million increase attributable to an overall increase in the average unit price 
the increase was due primarily to a change in the mix of product sales  driven by an increase in the consumer electronics category  which has the highest average price point of any category  as a percentage of total product sales 
additionally  there were category price point increases as a result of a shift to higher priced high efficiency laundry items and increases in price points on furniture and mattresses  partially offset by a decline in the average price points on lawn and garden  and o approximately million was attributable to increases in unit sales  due primarily to increased consumer electronics especially flat panel televisions  track and lawn and garden sales  partially offset by a decline in appliance sales 
the following table presents the makeup of net sales by product category in each period  including service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues  expressed both in dollar amounts and as a percent of total net sales

this increase is due to continued consumer interest in lcd televisions  which offset declines in projection and plasma televisions 
the home appliance category declined as increased laundry and air conditioning sales were offset by lower refrigeration and cooking sales  as the appliance market in general showed continued weakness 
the increase in track sales consisting largely of computers  computer peripherals  video game equipment  portable electronics and small appliances is driven primarily by increased video game equipment  blu ray player  laptop computer and gps device sales  partially offset by declines in camcorder  camera  mp player and desktop computer sales 
this increase is due to store expansion and a change in our furniture and mattresses merchandising driven by the multi vendor strategy implemented during the prior year 
this category benefited from an increase in sales of generators in the areas affected by the hurricanes that impacted certain of our markets and was partially offset by lower sales of lawn care equipment 
this decrease was due to a reduction in the total number of deliveries  primarily as customers take advantage of the ability to carry out smaller flat panel televisions 
this increase is due to the increase in product sales 
this decrease is driven by a decrease in the number of warranty service calls performed by our technicians

del change dollars in thousands securitization income including fair value adjustment    insurance commissions    interest income and other   finance charges and other   del 
the decline in securitization income resulted primarily from a million increase in the non cash fair value adjustment to reduce our interests in securitized assets 
additionally  as a result of the completion of our new revolving credit facility  we are retaining certain new customer receivables generated on our consolidated balance sheet and not transferring them to the qspe 
as a result of the reduced transfer of receivables to the qspe and the higher discount rate being in the determination of the fair value of the receivables  gains on sales of receivables included in securitization income has declined to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  because of the higher average balance of our retained interest in the receivables held by the qspe  as compared to the same period in the prior year  and increases in the discount rate assumption used in our fair value calculation  interest earned on our retained interest included in securitization income has increased to million for the year ended january   from million in the prior year 
insurance commissions have declined due to lower retrospective commissions  which were negatively impacted by higher claims filings due to hurricanes gustav and ike  and lower interest earnings on funds held by the insurance company for the payment of claims 
interest income and other increased million due primarily to an increase in new customer receivables generated that are being held on balance sheet to a balance of million at january   from million in the prior year

the increase in sg a expense was largely attributable to the addition of new stores and expenses of approximately million  net of estimated insurance proceeds  that we incurred related to the two hurricanes that occurred during the year 
the decrease in our sg a expense as a percent of revenues was negatively affected by the negative impact of the fair value adjustment on total revenues  with the decrease shown above being reduced by basis points due to the negative impact of the fair value adjustments on total revenues 
the improvement in our sg a expense as a percent of revenues was largely driven by lower compensation costs in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenues as compared to the prior year  as well as reduced advertising expense as a percent of revenues 
additionally  reductions in certain store operating expenses  including repairs and maintenance and janitorial services contributed to the improvement 
partially offsetting these improvements were increases in utility  credit data processing and stock based compensation expenses

due to the large non cash fair value adjustment reducing our interests in securitized assets this period  and the fact that taxes for the state of texas are recorded based on gross margin  instead of income before taxes  the effective rate was higher during the period as we did not receive a benefit for taxes for the state of texas on the non cash fair value adjustment

o a million increase generated by thirteen retail locations that were not open for twelve consecutive months in each period  o a million decrease resulted from an increase in discounts on promotional credit sales  and o a million increase resulted from an increase in service revenues 
the components of the million increase in net sales were a million increase in product sales and an million net increase in service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues 
the million increase in product sales resulted from the following o approximately million was attributable to increases in unit sales  due primarily to increased consumer electronics especially flat panel televisions and furniture sales  partially offset by a decline in appliance and track sales  and o approximately million was attributable to an overall increase in the average unit price 
the increase was driven primarily by a change in the mix of product sales  as consumer electronics  which has the highest average price  became a larger share of our total product sales and was partially offset by the million increase in discounts on extended term promotional credit sales

this increase is due to increased unit volume in the area of flat panel televisions  partially offset by a decline in the sale of tube and projection televisions 
while the industry is down nationally  we expect to outperform the national trend and are taking steps to improve our performance relative to merchandising  advertising and promotion of this category 
additionally  we experienced higher than normal demand for these products in the prior year due to consumers replacing appliances after hurricanes katrina and rita  especially during the first three months of the period 
the increase in track sales consisting largely of computers  computer peripherals  video game equipment  portable electronics and small appliances is driven primarily by increased laptop computer and video game equipment sales and was partially offset by reduced sales of portable electronics  including camcorders  digital cameras and portable crt televisions 
this increase is due to the increased emphasis on the sales of mattresses and furniture  primarily sofas  recliners and entertainment centers  and new product lines added to the furniture category 
this category benefited from a high level of rainfall in the current year and an increase in sales of higher priced lawn and garden equipment  such as zero turn radius mowers and tractors 
this increase was due to an increase in the delivery fee charged to our customers  as the total number of deliveries declined slightly as compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to the increase in product sales  increased sales penetration and decreased sma cancellations as credit charge offs declined as compared to the prior year period 
this increase is driven by increased units in operation as we continue to grow product sales and an increase in the cost of parts used to repair higher priced technology flat panel televisions  etc caption

this decrease in taxes was impacted primarily by the decrease in pretax income 
additionally  the effective tax rate declined from for the year ended january   to for the year ended january  the decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to the reversal of previously accrued texas margin tax as a result of the legal entity reorganization completed during the three months ended july  in july  we began accruing margin tax for the entities that acquired the operations through the mergers completed during the quarter 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
however  a significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our internal distribution system and our next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and any such significant increases could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not affect our competitors in the same manner as it affects us 
seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is somewhat seasonal  with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends january  due primarily to the holiday selling season 
over the four quarters of fiscal  gross margins were   and 
we recorded reductions in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets totaling million during fiscal  which caused both the gross margin and operating margin each quarter to be reduced 
during the same period  operating margins were   and 
a portion of the fluctuation in gross margins and operating margins is due to planned infrastructure cost additions  such as increased warehouse space and larger stores  additional personnel and systems required to absorb the significant increase in revenues that we have experienced over the last several years 
additionally  quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending on factors such as the following o timing of new product introductions  new store openings and store relocations  o sales contributed by new stores  o increases or decreases in comparable store sales  o adverse weather conditions  o shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions  and o changes in our merchandise mix 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full year

liquidity and capital resources we require capital to finance our growth as we increase sales at our existing stores and add new stores and markets to our operations  which in turn requires additional working capital for increased receivables and inventory 
we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended terms provided by our vendors for inventory purchases  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and transfers of receivables to our asset backed securitization facilities 
at january   we had revolving lines of credit in the amount of million  under which we had million in borrowings outstanding  and had utilized million of availability to issue letters of credit 
as of january   we had million under our revolving credit facility and million under an unsecured bank line of credit immediately available to us for general corporate purposes 
in addition to the million currently available under the revolving credit facility  an additional million will become available under the borrowing base calculation as we grow the balance of eligible receivables retained by us and when there is growth in total eligible inventory balances 
we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including those for our capital expenditure requirements  will be met with our available lines of credit  together with cash generated from operations 
while we have no new stores currently under development for fiscal  our long term plans are to grow our store base by approximately a year  dependent upon future capital availability 
we expect we will invest in inventory  real estate and customer receivables to support the additional stores and same store sales growth 
depending on market conditions we may  at times  slow or suspend our new store growth plans  enter into sale leaseback transactions to finance our real estate or seek alternative financing sources for new store expansions and customer receivables growth  including expansion of existing lines of credit  and accessing new debt or equity markets 
on august   we executed a million revolving credit facility that provides funding based on a borrowing base calculation that includes accounts receivable and inventory 
the borrowing base calculation includes various reserves against availability  including the ability of the lender to require additional reserves from time to time 
the new facility  which replaced our million revolving credit facility  matures in august and bears interest at libor plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the spread will be basis points for the first six months under the new loan agreement  and then will be subject to adjustment as discussed above 
additionally  the new loan agreement includes an accordion feature allowing for future expansion of the committed amount up to million 
in conjunction with completing this financing arrangement  our qspe amended certain of its borrowing agreements to provide for the existence of the new revolving credit facility and adjust certain terms of its borrowing arrangements to current market requirements  including reducing the advance rate on its variable funding note facility from a maximum of to a maximum of 
as a result of completing the new revolving credit facility  a larger portion of the accounts receivable we generate will be retained by us and not sold to the qspe  and as such will be included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a summary of the significant financial covenants that govern our revolving credit facility compared to our actual compliance status at january   is presented below caption 
del required minimum actual maximum fixed charge coverage ratio must exceed required minimum to to leverage ratio must be lower than required maximum to to cash recovery percentage must exceed required minimum capital expenditures  net must be lower than required maximum million million del 
we expect  based on current facts and circumstances  that we will be in compliance with the above covenants through fiscal events of default under the credit facility include  but are not limited to  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in certain circumstances  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty  default under or acceleration of certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  certain judgments and other liabilities  certain environmental claims  and a change of control 
if an event of default occurs  the lenders under the credit facility are entitled to take various actions  including accelerating amounts due under the credit facility and requiring that all such amounts be immediately paid in full 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by all of our and our subsidiaries assets  excluding customer receivables owned by the qspe and certain inventory subject to vendor floor plan arrangements 
the following is a comparison of our statement of cash flows for our fiscal years and during the year ended january   net cash used in operating activities increased to million  from million used in operating activities in the twelve months ended january  operating cash flows for the current period were impacted primarily by the increased retention of customer accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet and increased inventories to support newly opened stores  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balances  due to the timing of inventory purchases and taking advantage of payment terms available from our vendors 
prior to the quarter ended october   virtually all customer accounts receivable were transferred to and funded by our qspe  resulting in the net cash flow activity from these transactions being reported in cash flows from operating activities 
however  the cash flow presentation is different for customer accounts receivable retained by us and financed through our revolving credit facility  with the increase in the accounts receivable balance being reflected as a use of cash in cash flows from operating activities  and borrowings on our revolving credit facility being reflected in cash flows from financing activities 
as a result  we expect  as we continue to grow the balance of customer accounts receivable retained by us  that we will typically report cash flows used in operating activities  with the funding for this activity provided by our revolving credit facility resulting in us reporting cash provided by financing activities 
as noted above  we offer promotional credit programs to certain customers that provide for same as cash or deferred interest interest free periods of varying terms  generally three  six    and months  and require monthly payments beginning in the month after the sale 
the various same as cash promotional accounts and deferred interest program accounts are eligible for securitization up to the limits provided for in our securitization agreements 
this limit is currently of eligible securitized receivables 
if we exceed this limit  we would be required to use some of our other capital resources to carry the unfunded balances of the receivables for the promotional period 
the percentage of eligible securitized receivables represented by promotional receivables was and  as of january   and  respectively 
there is no limitation on the amount of deferred interest program accounts that can be carried as collateral under the revolving credit facility 
the percentage of all managed receivables represented by promotional receivables was as of january   as compared to at january  the weighted average promotional period was months and months for the same as cash promotional receivables outstanding as of january   and  respectively 
the weighted average remaining term on those same promotional receivables was months and months as of january   and  respectively 
while overall these promotional receivables have a shorter weighted average term than non promotional receivables  we receive less income on these receivables  resulting in a reduction of the net interest margin on those receivables 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million  from million used in the fiscal period to million used in the fiscal period 
the net increase in cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from a decline in proceeds from sales of property and equipment as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the cash expended for property and equipment was used primarily for construction of new stores and the reformatting of existing stores to better support our current product mix 
net cash from financing activities increased by million from million used during the year ended january   to million provided during the year ended january   as we terminated our stock repurchase program in the current fiscal period and increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the new customer receivables generated and retained on our consolidated balance sheet 
in its regularly scheduled meeting on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  dependent on market conditions and the price of the stock 
through january   we had spent million under this authorization to acquire  shares of our common stock  though there were no shares repurchased during the year ended january   and our board of directors has terminated the repurchase program 
we lease of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but do not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future new store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is approximately million per store  and for our existing store remodels  in the range of  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are continuously reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease programs  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores  but could include full ownership if it meets our cash investment strategy

there was million of letters of credit issued at january  included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  service maintenance and credit insurance sales  in august we entered into the million revolving credit facility and in we created a qspe to provide financing for the customer receivables we originate 
both the bank credit facility and the asset backed securitization program are significant factors relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use either of these programs because of a failure to comply with their covenants would adversely affect our continued growth 
funding of current and future receivables under the asset backed securitization program can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aged receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible receivable amounts 
given the ongoing turmoil in securitization market  we have been unable to issue new medium term notes and  as a result  entered in the bank revolving credit facility discussed above 
we are financing customer receivable portfolio growth through the use of the bank revolving facility and expect this to be a primary source of funding our customer receivables portfolio during fiscal we have received initial indications that at least a portion of the million revolving securitization facility that matures in august  will likely not be renewed 
if that is the case  any borrowings outstanding in excess of any portion of the commitment that is renewed  if any  would be required to be paid down using the proceeds from collections on the receivables portfolio 
our current plan is to reduce the balance outstanding under this commitment before the maturity date 
as such  we will fund new receivables generated using our existing cash flows  borrowings on our asset based loan facility and may be required to obtain new sources of financing to continue funding the growth in our credit operations 
we will continue to finance our operations and future growth through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements  debt or equity offerings and the qspe s asset backed securitization facilities 
based on our current operating plans  including assuming that all or a portion of the million revolving securitization facility is not renewed in august  we believe that cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and unsecured credit line  extended vendor terms for purchases of inventory  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and cash flows from the qspe s asset backed securitization program will be sufficient to fund our operations  store expansion and updating activities and capital programs for at least months 
however  there are several factors that could decrease cash provided by operating activities  including o reduced demand or margins for our products  o more stringent vendor terms on our inventory purchases  o loss of ability to acquire inventory on consignment  o increases in product cost that we may not be able to pass on to our customers  o reductions in product pricing due to competitor promotional activities  o changes in inventory requirements based on longer delivery times of the manufacturers or other requirements which would negatively impact our delivery and distribution capabilities  o an acceleration of the growth of the credit portfolio  o increases in the retained portion of our receivables portfolio under our current qspe s asset backed securitization program as a result of changes in performance or types of receivables transferred promotional versus non promotional and primary versus secondary portfolio  or as a result of a change in the mix of funding sources available to the qspe  requiring higher collateral levels  or limitations on the ability of the qspe to obtain financing through its commercial paper based funding sources  o reduced availability under our revolving credit facility as a result of borrowing base requirements and the impact on the borrowing base calculation of changes in the performance of the receivables financed by that facility  o reductions in the capacity or inability to expand the capacity available for financing our receivables portfolio under existing or replacement qspe asset backed securitization programs or a requirement that we retain a higher percentage of the credit portfolio under such programs  o increases in program costs interest and administrative fees relative to our receivables portfolio associated with the funding of our receivables  o increases in personnel costs or other costs for us to stay competitive in our markets  and o the inability of our qspe to get its current variable funding note facility renewed at its annual maturity date 
if necessary  in addition to available cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving facilities  additional cash to fund our growth and increases in receivables balances could be obtained by o reducing capital expenditures for updates of existing stores or new store openings  o taking advantage of longer payment terms and financing available for inventory purchases  o utilizing third party sources to provide financing to our customers  o reducing operating costs  o negotiating to expand the capacity available under existing credit facilities  and o accessing new debt or equity markets 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain these sources of funding on favorable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet financing arrangements since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  service maintenance and credit insurance sales  we have created a qualified special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue medium term and variable funding notes secured by the receivables to third parties to obtain cash for these purchases 
we transfer receivables  consisting of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated  unsecured promissory notes 
to finance its acquisition of these receivables  the issuer has issued the notes and bonds described below to third parties 
the unsecured promissory notes issued to us are subordinate to these third party notes and bonds 
at january   the issuer had issued two series of notes and bonds the series a variable funding note with a total availability of million and three classes of series a bonds with an aggregate amount outstanding of million  of which million was required to be placed in a restricted cash account for the benefit of the bondholders 
the series a variable funding note is composed of a million day tranche  and a million tranche that is annually renewable  at our option  until september in august  the issuer completed an extension of the maturity date on the day commitment to august  we have received initial indications that at least a portion of the million revolving securitization facility that matures in august  will likely not be renewed 
if that is the case  any borrowings outstanding in excess of any portion of the commitment that is renewed  if any  would be required to be paid down using the proceeds from collections on the receivables portfolio 
our current plan is to reduce the balance outstanding under this commitment before the maturity date 
in conjunction with the renewal  the cost of borrowings under this million facility increased and now bear interest at the commercial paper rate plus basis points  in most instances 
if the net portfolio yield  as defined by agreements  falls below  then the issuer may be required to fund additions to the cash reserves in the restricted cash accounts 
the net portfolio yield was at january  private institutional investors  primarily insurance companies  purchased the series a bonds at a weighted fixed rate of 
the weighted average interest on the variable funding note during the month of january was 
we continue to service the transferred accounts for the qspe  and we receive a monthly servicing fee  so long as we act as servicer  in an amount equal to 
multiplied by the average aggregate principal amount of receivables serviced 
the issuer records revenues equal to the interest charged to the customer on the receivables less losses  the cost of funds  the program administration fees paid in connection with either the series a  or series a bond holders  the servicing fee and additional earnings to the extent they are available 
currently the series a variable funding note permits the issuer to borrow funds up to million to purchase receivables from us or make principal payments on other bonds  thereby functioning as a basket to accumulate receivables 
as issuer borrowings under the series a variable funding note approach the total commitment  the issuer is required to request an increase in the series a amount or issue a new series of bonds and use the proceeds to pay down the then outstanding balance of the series a variable funding note  so that the basket will once again become available to accumulate new receivables or meet other obligations required under the transaction documents 
given the current state of the financial markets  especially with respect to asset backed securitization financing  we have been unable to issue medium term notes or increase the availability under the existing variable funding note program 
as of january   borrowings under the series a variable funding note were million 
we are not directly liable to the lenders under the asset backed securitization facility 
if the issuer is unable to repay the series a note and series a bonds due to its inability to collect the transferred customer accounts  the issuer could not pay the subordinated notes it has issued to us in partial payment for transferred customer accounts  and the series a bond holders could claim the balance in its million restricted cash account 
we are also contingently liable under a million letter of credit that secures the performance of our obligations or services under the servicing agreement as it relates to the transferred assets that are part of the asset backed securitization facility 
the issuer is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants contained in the transaction documents governing the series a variable funding note and series a bonds  including covenants that restrict  subject to specified exceptions the incurrence of non permitted indebtedness and other obligations and the granting of additional liens  mergers  acquisitions  investments and disposition of assets  and the use of proceeds of the program 
the issuer also makes representations and warranties relating to compliance with certain laws  payment of taxes  maintenance of its separate legal entity  preservation of its existence  protection of collateral and financial reporting 
in addition  the program requires the issuer to maintain a minimum net worth

we expect  based on current facts and circumstances  that we will be in compliance with the above covenants through fiscal events of default under the series a variable funding note and the series a bonds  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in some circumstances  include  among others failure of the issuer to pay principal  interest or fees  violation by the issuer of any of its covenants or agreements  inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the issuer  certain servicer defaults  failure of the trustee to have a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the collateral  default under or acceleration of certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  failure to maintain certain loss ratios and portfolio yield  change of control provisions and certain other events pertaining to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable and are determined  at our option  as the base rate  which is the prime rate plus the base rate margin  which ranges from to  or libor plus the libor margin  which ranges from to 
interest rates under our qspe s variable funding note facility are variable and are determined based on the commercial paper rate plus a spread of 
accordingly  changes in the prime rate  the commercial paper rate or libor  which are affected by changes in interest rates generally  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  these credit facilities 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk in determining the fair value of the interest only strip we receive from our sales of receivables to the qspe  due to rate variability under the qspe s variable funding note discussed above 
an increase in interest rates that reduced the net interest spread under the interest only strip by would result in a million reduction in the fair value of our interests in securitized assets 
since january   our interest rate sensitivity has increased on the interest only strip as the variable rate portion of the qspe s debt has increased from million  or of its total debt  to million  or of its total debt 
as a result  a basis point increase in interest rates on the variable rate debt would increase borrowing costs million over a month period  based on the balance outstanding at january  our revolving credit facility also has variable interest rates and at january  we had million outstanding 
as a result  a basis point increase in interest rates on the variable rate debt would increase borrowing costs million over a month period  based on the balance outstanding at january
