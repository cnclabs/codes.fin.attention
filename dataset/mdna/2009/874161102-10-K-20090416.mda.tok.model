talbots collection merchandise is available in stores  catalogs  and online 
as part of our strategic initiatives  we have made the decision to phase out the talbots collection label 
our final collection deliveries are expected to be received in stores in june instead of offering our customers talbots collection merchandise  we will be offering refined options at similar price points under the talbots label 
talbots upscale outlets 
we currently plan to open upscale outlet stores in we are currently designing merchandise specifically for sale in these outlet locations 
we believe the upscale outlet opportunity will allow us to create an assortment with lower price points that will attract a new unique customer base  one who shops predominantly at upscale outlets 
our upscale outlets are not intended to be used for the sale of past season and as is merchandise 
we currently plan to continue to operate our non upscale outlets for the sale of clearance merchandise

we believe that providing a broad mix of store location types allows us to offer locations that are convenient to our customers 
optimization of store productivity as our industry continues to face unprecedented uncertainty and volatility  we are focusing on what is in our control to best manage our business 
we are constantly evaluating our portfolio of stores and closing or converting stores that are not meeting internal profitability expectations 
we believe these efforts will result in increased productivity for our remaining stores 
we have identified approximately stores that we plan on closing in  of which a significant portion have leases that will expire during the year 
plan in the near term  as we control our cost structure to manage the cash flow needs of our business  we have decided to reduce our capital spending 
in  we spent approximately million in capital expenditures primarily related to new store openings and expansions of our existing stores

our direct marketing segment includes our catalog and internet channels 
since  we have used our direct marketing business to offer customers convenience in ordering talbots brand merchandise 
in  our direct marketing business segment represented of our total sales from continuing operations  with the internet channel comprising of our total direct marketing sales from continuing operations 
our catalogs are designed to promote our brand s image and drive customers to their preferred shopping channel  including stores  call centers  and online 
in  as part of our strategic initiatives  we increased catalog circulation for the talbots brand in order to strengthen relations with our existing customers  prospect new customers  and drive reactivation of our lapsed customers 
in  we issued separate talbots brand catalogs across all business concepts with a circulation of approximately million  an increase of in circulation from we believe our efforts  in early fall  yielded a solid increase in response rate  especially with our existing and lapsed customers 
additionally  our new creative team has redesigned our talbots catalogs  and beginning with our june catalog  the improvements have been fully aligned across all channels 
we utilize computer applications which employ mathematical models to improve the efficiency of our catalog mailings through refinement of our customer list 
a principal factor in improving customer response has been the development of our own list of active customers 
we routinely monitor customer interest and update and refine this list 
our customer list also provides important demographic information and serves as an integral part of our store expansion or closing strategy by helping to identify markets with the potential to support a new store or to identify where a store is no longer warranted 
we follow the direct marketing association s recommendations on consumer privacy protection practices 
we strive to make catalog shopping as convenient as possible 
we maintain toll free numbers  accessible seven days a week except christmas day  to accept requests for catalogs and to take customer orders 
in  we maintained a call center in knoxville  tennessee designed to provide uninterrupted service to customers 
telephone calls are answered by knowledgeable call center sales associates who enter customer orders and retrieve information about merchandise and its availability 
these sales associates also suggest and help to select merchandise and can provide detailed information regarding size  color  fit  and other merchandise features 
we have achieved efficiencies in order entry and fulfillment  which permit the shipment of most orders the next day 
our internet channel is a natural extension of our existing store and catalog channels  offering the same broad assortment of our store and catalog merchandise

merchandising  inventory control and distribution merchandising our evolved merchandising strategy focuses on honoring the classics  which emphasizes tradition transformed  or modern classic  relevant  and youthful merchandise across a number of product classifications for our talbots brand 
we are dedicated in ensuring that our customer is offered compelling new merchandise and floor sets on a monthly basis 
our stores  catalogs  and website offer a variety of key basic and fashion items and a complementary assortment of accessories and shoes which enable customers to assemble complete outfits 
sales associates are trained to assist customers in merchandise selection and wardrobe coordination  helping them achieve the talbots brand look from head to toe 
branded merchandise design and purchasing 
our branded merchandise is designed and produced through the coordinated efforts of our creative  merchandising and sourcing teams 
by conceptualizing and designing in house  we have been able to realize higher average initial gross profit margins for our clothing and accessories  while at the same time providing value to our customers 
styles for our branded merchandise are developed based upon analysis of historical  current  and anticipated future fashion trends that will appeal to our target customers 
our talbots brand teams consist of our new york based creative studio  our hingham  massachusetts based buying and sourcing staffs  and our hong kong and india based sourcing offices 
in late  we appointed two key executives to lead our creative and merchandising areas including a newly established position of chief creative officer 
the position of chief creative officer was established as part of our goal to migrate to a design driven brand 
the new design and merchandising teams made significant improvements in the brand in  including reinvigorating the brand s image and aligning the image and product assortments across all channels presented to the customer  including visual store signage  catalog design  and website visuals 
the team s first deliveries were presented across all channels in the third quarter of and despite the economic pressures  received positive customer response 
sourcing 
we currently procure merchandise globally from a balanced and diversified network of sourcing and manufacturing networks 
our products are produced by independent manufacturers to our specifications and standards  primarily in the greater asia pacific region 
a substantial portion of our merchandise is currently managed by our own sourcing offices in hong kong and india 
the balance of our merchandise is purchased from other sources based in the us that may rely on their own offshore sources for manufactured goods 
in mid  we appointed a key executive to lead our sourcing area under the newly established position of chief supply chain officer 
the position was established as part of our continuing goal to improve profitability through improved sourcing efficiencies 
in order to diversify our sourcing operations  in we utilized exclusive overseas sourcing arrangements in indonesia  singapore  and thailand 
during  under the terms of an agreement with eralda industries eralda  a long time supplier for the company  eralda served as our exclusive agent in indonesia  singapore  thailand  and malaysia and as a non exclusive agent in hong kong  macau  and china 
beginning in the fall of  we will no longer be utilizing eralda as our exclusive agent 
in april  we announced that we are in discussions with li fung  a global sourcing and trading firm based in hong kong  to mutually explore a potential outsourcing relationship between the company and li fung 
we believe that a partnership with li fung  if entered into  could create significant potential benefits by simplifying our sourcing processes  reducing operating expenses and potentially further reducing our gross margins by leveraging our extensive and diverse network of vendors 
we frequently analyze our overall distribution of manufacturing to ensure that no one vendor or country is responsible for a disproportionate amount of our merchandise 
the following table shows the distribution of our product sourcing in for the talbots brand offshore sources hong kong india eralda other total us sourcing sourcing exclusive offshore offshore based office office agent sources sources sources total we currently do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any vendor 
we take measures to monitor our vendors for compliance with the fair labor standards act  security procedures  and rules mandated by the us customs and border patrol 
inventory control and distribution we use centralized distribution systems  under which all us merchandise is received  processed  and distributed through our store and direct marketing distribution center in lakeville  massachusetts for the talbots brand 
we also lease space in a smaller distribution center in canada to process talbots brand store inventory in canada 
merchandise received at the distribution center is assigned to individual stores and packed for delivery and shipped to the stores  or assigned for catalog and online sales fulfillment 
we ship merchandise to our stores virtually every business day  with each store generally receiving merchandise twice a week 
we believe that our strong store  catalog  and online synergy  coupled with our central distribution systems allow us to move merchandise efficiently between our three distribution channels to take better advantage of sales trends 
customer credit we have extended credit to our talbots brand customers through the use of our privately held talbots charge card 
the talbots charge card is managed through talbots classics national bank  a wholly owned chartered national bank subsidiary  and talbots classics finance company  a wholly owned subsidiary 
we believe that the offering of the talbots charge card enhances customer loyalty  produces finance charge income  and decreases third party bankcard fees 
us talbots charge card holders are automatically enrolled in the brand s customer loyalty program which rewards us talbots brand customers with a twenty five dollar appreciation award for every five hundred points earned 
prior to january  one point was earned for every dollar of merchandise purchased on a talbots charge card 
commencing in january  we launched a new expanded program with three levels red  platinum  and black 
the red level is open to all customers  regardless of whether they hold a talbots credit card  and accrues points for every dollar of merchandise purchased with a non talbots charge payment 
the platinum level is the same as the prior program with one point being earned for every dollar of merchandise purchased on a talbots charge card 
the black level is for talbots credit card holders who spend more than a  per calendar year on their talbots charge card  and accrues points for every dollar of merchandise purchased on their talbots charge card 
the awards can be redeemed against future purchases and expire one year from the date of issuance 
the customer loyalty program has led to increased usage of the talbots charge card  as customer usage increased from of total sales in to of total sales in we expect that the new program will also lead to increased usage of the talbots charge card 
management information systems our management information systems and electronic data processing systems are located at our systems center in tampa  florida  and at our corporate facilities in hingham  massachusetts 
our systems consist of a full range of retail  financial  and merchandising systems  including credit  inventory distribution and control  sales reporting  budgeting and forecasting  financial reporting  merchandise reporting  and distribution 
we seek to protect company sensitive information on our servers from unauthorized access using industry standard network security systems in addition to anti virus and firewall protection 
the website makes use of encryption technology to help protect sensitive customer information 
all of our stores have point of sale terminals that transmit information daily on sales by item  color  and size 
our stores are equipped with bar code scanning programs for the recording of store sales  returns  inventories  price changes  receipts  and transfers 
we evaluate this information  together with weekly reports on merchandise statistics  prior to making merchandising decisions regarding reorders of fast selling items and the allocation of merchandise 
seasonality the nature of our business is to have two distinct selling seasons  spring and fall  with monthly floor sets 
the first and second quarters of the fiscal year make up the spring season and the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year make up the fall season 
within the spring season  direct marketing sales are typically stronger in the first quarter and retail store sales are typically slightly stronger in the second quarter 
within the fall season  direct marketing sales and retail store sales are generally the strongest in the fourth quarter 
for further discussion on seasonality see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations below 
marketing our marketing initiatives have been developed to elevate brand awareness and increase customer acquisition and retention 
in early  we appointed a key executive to lead our marketing initiatives under the newly established position of chief marketing officer 
our talbots brand marketing programs consist of catalogs distributed across all business concepts  customer mailing and internet advertising  and other marketing campaigns such as direct promotional customer incentives 
in an effort to maximize the return on our marketing initiatives  we decided to eliminate television and national print advertising in and and redirect a portion of our marketing budget to enhance customer outreach through reactivation  prospecting  and web based marketing 
in  we plan to increase our email marketing initiatives and decrease our catalog distribution 
we also plan to pursue innovative new strategies to increase contact with potential customers 
competition the retail apparel industry is highly competitive 
we believe that the principal basis upon which we compete is fashion  quality  value  and service in offering modern classic talbots brand apparel to customers  through stores  catalogs  and online 
we compete with national department stores  regional department store chains  specialty retailers  and catalog companies 
we believe that our focused apparel merchandise selection  consistently branded merchandise  superior customer service  store site selection resulting from the synergy between our stores and direct marketing operations  and the availability of our merchandise in multiple concepts  distinguish us from department stores and other specialty retailers 
employees as of january   we had approximately  talbots brand employees of whom approximately  were full time salaried employees  approximately  were full time hourly employees  and approximately  were part time hourly employees 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
in june  we committed to a workforce reduction resulting in the elimination of approximately of our corporate headcount across multiple locations and at all levels as part of our strategic long range plan 
in february  we reduced our corporate headcount by approximately positions  or approximately  as part of our planned expense reduction program 
for a discussion regarding reductions in workforce due to our initiative to reduce costs and streamline our organization  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview below

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors are important to understanding any statements in this report  in other filings with the securities and exchange commission  and in any other discussions of our business 
the following information should be read in conjunction with item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our liquidity  business  financial condition  or future results 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties may also adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
the following discussion of risk factors contains forward looking statements as referred to in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sustained and expanding adverse us economic conditions continue to substantially impact our business 
the disruption in the capital and credit markets has reached unprecedented levels and has significantly and adversely impacted us and global economic conditions and consumer discretionary spending 
these continuing economic conditions substantially impact our sales  margins  cash flows  liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
these economic conditions materially and adversely impact consumer confidence and consumer spending  our ability to forecast our continuing operations and operating results  our ability to execute and achieve our strategic  operational  restructuring and cost saving initiatives  our vendors and suppliers and the risk of any disruption in the supply of merchandise to us  our cash flows and other sources of funding of our continuing operations  strategic initiatives  restructure activities  debt service requirements  capital expenditures and the obligations arising in the normal operation of our business  the sale of our j 
jill business  and our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing at the times and in the amounts as may be needed 
we are unable to predict the likely duration or ultimate severity of the us economic conditions  and if the current and economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  our business  continuing operations  financial results  liquidity and financial position would be increasingly materially and adversely impacted 
further  a sustained economic downturn would likely cause a number of the risks that we currently face to increase in likelihood and scope 
we continue to incur net operating losses which may continue until us economic conditions improve 
we have continued to incur net operating losses and our existing operations are not generating positive cash flow  which may continue until us economic conditions and consumer discretionary spending improve 
in response to these economic conditions and our sales and operating performance  we have taken the following working capital and other financing actions in april of  we obtained a new million secured revolving loan facility from aeon which matures upon the earlier of i april  or ii one or more securitization programs or structured loans by the company or its subsidiaries in an aggregate equivalent principal amount to the revolving loan commitment amount  approved in advance by aeon as lender and in form and substance satisfactory to the lender 
funding under this facility is subject to mortgage and lien recordings and all necessary consents or waivers by existing lenders to the transactions contemplated by the agreement  including the granting of liens and mortgages in favor of aeon under the facility  without such lender requiring prepayment of its indebtedness or the establishment of a pari passu lien on the collateral in favor of such lender 
amounts may be borrowed  repaid  and reborrowed under the facility and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in february of we refinanced through aeon our outstanding million term loan  which now no longer requires scheduled principal amortization prior to the loan maturity date  which greatly added to our liquidity and financial flexibility  resulting in anticipated fiscal cash flow improvement of approximately million 
the facility matures on august   provided that we will have the option to extend the maturity for additional six month periods  up to the third anniversary of the loan closing date  which is february  in february of  aeon guaranteed our outstanding debt under our existing working capital facilities totaling million  our existing revolving credit facilities totaling million  and our existing million term loan facility 
in april of aeon also agreed i that it would agree to continue to provide a guaranty for a refinancing of any of that debt  which currently matures at various dates on and before april  and ii if the lender failed to agree to refinance that debt on or before the existing maturity date  or if any other condition occurred that required aeon to make a payment under its existing guaranty  aeon would make a loan to us  due on or after april  and within the limits of aeon s existing loan guaranty  to avoid any lack of our financial resources caused by any such failure of refinancing 
in april of aeon also confirmed its support for our working capital improvements initiatives for our merchandise payables management and that it will use commercially reasonable effort to provide us with financial support through loan or guarantee up to million only if  and to the extent that  we may possibly fall short in achieving our targeted cash flow improvement for fall merchandise payables 
in july of  we entered into a million subordinated working capital term loan facility with aeon usa  inc aeon usa  our majority shareholder and a wholly owned subsidiary of aeon  in early  we eliminated all financial covenants ratios from our debt agreements 
our ability to operate profitably and to generate positive cash flows is dependant upon many factors  including improvement in economic conditions and consumer spending and our ability to successfully execute our fiscal and longer term financial plan and our strategic initiatives 
we will need financing or other liquidity sources to replace or refinance our working capital and revolving credit facilities which are due to expire at various dates in and  unless further extended or refinanced by the existing lenders or by aeon pursuant to its refinancing support letter  and for the aeon secured revolving loan facility when it matures in  as well as for other debt as it matures 
further  while we currently anticipate  based on our current assumptions and forecast for fiscal  that we have developed a financial plan for fiscal that if successfully executed will provide sufficient liquidity to finance our anticipated working capital and other currently expected cash needs for fiscal  there nevertheless can be no certainty and we may need additional financing or credit availability for our near and longer term cash needs 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends upon many factors  including our financial projections and our prospects and creditworthiness  as well as external economic conditions and general liquidity in the credit markets 
there can be no assurance that any of these efforts will be successful or  if successful  will be sufficient in the amounts or at the time needed 
we may not be able to achieve our expected improvement in operating results  working capital and cash flows 
as a specialty retailer dependent upon consumer discretionary spending  we expect to continue to face an extremely challenging fiscal as global economic conditions have continued into our fiscal first quarter and impacted our sales  cash flows and operating results 
in response to these conditions  we have taken the following actions  among others in april of we obtained new working capital financing  in february of we began to implement our million expense reduction program  we have indefinitely suspended our quarterly dividend and frozen our defined benefit pension plans  we have reduced our fiscal planned capital expenditures by approximately over fiscal  and continue to control spending  and we have been effectively managing our inventory  with year end fiscal inventories down over the prior year  and we plan to continue to lower our inventory levels through effectively managing our inventory throughout fiscal however  our ability to successfully achieve improvement in our operating results  working capital  and liquidity depends upon a significant number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the continuation or further worsening of general economic conditions  our ability to obtain additional financing in the amounts we may need to fund our strategic plans  outstanding debt and operating losses  extensions of the commitment and maturity dates of our existing credit facilities  our ability to successfully execute other liquidity enhancing plans or transactions  achieving our sales plan for fiscal  achieving our cash flow plan for fiscal  particularly during our peak inventory build ups in advance of principal selling seasons  adequate and uninterrupted supply of merchandise  and continuation of merchandise purchases on open account purchase terms from merchandise vendors at expected levels and with extended invoice payment dates  our ability to sell our j 
jill brand business on acceptable terms  whether our strategic and cost saving actions will sufficiently improve our results  operating efficiencies  cash flows and liquidity  our ability to reduce cash spending in amounts and at the times needed  effective inventory management  any unanticipated changes in expected cash flows and liquidity  our ability to adequately respond to greater competitive pressures  our ability to adequately respond to changing fashion trends and consumers response to our merchandise  and our ability to adjust our operating plans in response to changing economic conditions 
we cannot provide assurances that any of these or other factors  plans and initiatives will be resolved or occur in our favor and  if not  our business  financial results and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted 
we may not be able to extend the maturity dates of our existing credit facilities 
we currently have committed working capital facilities totaling million with four banks with whom we have had a long term relationship  and which expire in december we also currently have outstanding debt of million under our revolving credit facilities with certain of these same lenders  which  unless further extended  currently have expiration dates on and before april  the revolving credit facilities with these lenders have been in place  at varying amounts  for a number of years and have generally matured for periods of up to not more than two years  subject to further extension in the discretion of the lender 
we are customarily fully borrowed against each of these revolving loan facilities 
in february of  aeon guaranteed the above working capital and revolving credit facilities  as well as a million term loan 
in april of  aeon also agreed i that it would agree to continue to provide a guaranty for a refinancing of any of that debt  which currently matures at various dates on and before april  and ii if the lender failed to agree to refinance that debt on or before the existing maturity date  or if any other condition occurred that required aeon to make a payment under its existing guaranty  aeon would make a loan to us  due on or after april  and within the limits of aeon s existing loan guaranty  to avoid any lack of our financial resources caused by any such failure of refinancing 
together with aeon  we are in discussions with each of these lenders to secure a further extension of the maturity date of the above working capital facilities and each of the revolving credit facilities  although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
if we are not able to obtain all or any of the above credit facilities refinancing or extensions from these lenders  we may need to obtain replacement financing or other alternative financing to replace any of our existing working capital  revolving loan or term loan facilities  or of any refinancing loan provided to us by aeon under its support letter to us 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully consummate any such replacement financing or other transactions to replace any expiring or maturing financing 
our financial and strategic plans are based on a number of material assumptions which may not occur 
over the past eighteen months we have initiated a significant number of strategic and realignment actions and continue to develop further plans to improve our operating efficiency  our cash flows and liquidity  and our long term profitability 
these initiatives have included workforce reductions  implementing operating initiatives designed to improve efficiencies and generate cost savings  closing underperforming stores  restructuring our business to a design driven merchandise organization  benefit plan reductions  and other realignment initiatives 
our financial plan and strategic initiatives are based on a number of significant assumptions which we developed based on our historical information  current and expected economic conditions  and expectations and perceptions of our near term and longer term sales  financial results and cost savings  as well as many other assumptions 
we have forecasted substantial cost savings from many of these initiatives based on a number of significant assumptions and expectations  which if achieved would improve cash flows and liquidity 
the current economic environment makes it difficult to project or forecast the costs of and results to be achieved from these initiatives 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions or expectations will prove to be accurate and it is likely that actual events  actions taken and results actually achieved will be materially different  and could be more costly  than what we have assumed or forecasted  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
even if we are successful in executing these strategic and realignment plans  there can be no assurance that the results achieved will be sufficient to offset or sufficiently negate the impact of the current poor economic condition or our operating results 
any disruption in our supply of merchandise would materially impact us 
all of our merchandise is manufactured to our specifications by third party suppliers and intermediary vendors  most of whom are located outside the united states 
historically  our merchandise purchases had been pursuant to and secured by letter of credit arrangements in favor of our foreign suppliers and vendors and their credit sources 
beginning more than a year ago we moved substantially all of our merchandise suppliers and vendors to open account purchase terms with payments approximately days after shipment 
with the continuation of the global economic conditions and its impact on consumer discretionary spending and our sales  particularly during the second half of and into  we extended many of our accounts payable terms to approximately days 
these cash management actions significantly improved cash flow and we plan to continue this accounts payable management going forward 
these payment terms have increased pressure from our merchandise vendors for payment in accordance with terms and have also increased pressures on these vendors from their own credit sources 
while these extended payment terms have not to date resulted in any material interruption in our merchandise supply  there can be no assurance that one or more of our vendors may not slow or cease shipments or require or condition their sale or shipment of merchandise on more stringent payment terms 
our suppliers and vendors could respond to any actual or apparent decrease in our liquidity or negative financial results by requiring or conditioning their sale of merchandise to us on much more stringent payment terms  such as requiring standby letters of credit  earlier or advance payment of invoices or payment upon delivery  or other assurances or credit support 
if this was to occur and we did not or were not able to adequately respond  it could disrupt our supply of merchandise and could require us to find other vendors  which may not be available at the times needed 
if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired  we may need to record significant non cash impairment charges 
we review our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  or when events indicate that the carrying value of such asset may be impaired 
due to the declines in our sales  stock price  and market capitalization that occurred in the fiscal fourth quarter  we were required to perform an interim test of our talbots brand goodwill and trademark for impairment 
after completion of the tests  we concluded that no impairment existed as of january  we review the carrying value of our assets for potential impairment using a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and a market value approach 
if an impairment is identified  the carrying value is compared to our estimated fair value and provisions for impairment are recorded as appropriate 
impairment losses are significantly impacted by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value 
our estimates of future operating cash flows are based upon our experience  knowledge and expectations  however  these estimates can be affected by such factors as our future operating results  future store profitability  and future economic conditions  all of which can be difficult to predict 
the carrying value of our assets may also be impacted by such factors as declines in stock price and in market capitalization 
the recent macro economic conditions have impacted both our performance as well as our stock price and market capitalization  and it is difficult to predict how long these economic conditions will continue  whether they will continue to deteriorate  and which aspects of our business may be adversely affected 
these conditions and the continuation of these conditions could impact the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and could result in future material impairment charges  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
due to the announcement to pursue the sale of our j 
jill business  we were required to estimate the fair value of this business  which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million in the third quarter of which is reflected in discontinued operations 
additionally  due to the current volatility in the economic environment and the decline in our stock price and market capitalization  we further reduced the fair value of the j 
jill brand business in the fourth quarter of and recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately million  which is reflected in discontinued operations 
although we believe that we will sell the j 
jill business within the next year  we cannot provide assurances that a sale of the brand business will occur 
if the sale does not occur or if the proceeds are less than we currently estimate  we may have to recognize further material impairments  which would adversely impact our results of operations 
we will need sufficient liquidity to fund the closing of our underperforming stores 
we regularly assess our portfolio of stores for profitability and we close underperforming stores when appropriate 
our strategic and realignment plans include closing underperforming stores in order to reduce operating losses and to achieve improved long term profitability of our store base 
the current economic conditions  which are expected to continue through fiscal and possibly beyond  may require us to close an increasing number of underperforming stores 
substantially all of our stores are leased  with lease terms continuing for up to ten years or more  and we have significant annual rent and other amounts due under each lease 
while in closing underperforming stores we endeavor to negotiate with landlords the amount of remaining lease obligations  there is no assurance we will reach acceptable negotiated lease settlements  particularly in the current economic environment 
as a result  costs to close underperforming stores may be significant and may negatively impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
the estimated costs and charges associated with store closings are also based on management s assumptions and projections and actual amounts may vary materially from our forecasts and expectations 
further  in light of the current economic environment  many other retailers have publicly announced plans to reduce their store bases and to close a number of their retail stores  many of which are in the same leased locations and with the same landlords as the stores we operate  including those stores that we currently have developed plans to close or in the future may determine to close 
as a result  negotiations for lease terminations with these landlords may be less favorable than in the past 
there can be no assurance of our success in selling our j 
jill business  nor the price or terms of such sale  and if a sale is consummated we may remain contingently responsible for certain risks and obligations 
in november  we announced our plan to sell j 
jill and we are actively pursing the sale at this time 
we report our j 
jill financial results as discontinued operations 
there can be no assurance that a sale or other disposition of the j 
jill business will be consummated on favorable terms or on terms we would find acceptable 
if such disposition is not consummated  our board of directors and management and its advisors would need to review and consider all strategic alternatives concerning the j 
jill business  under any of which alternatives we would expect to incur substantial costs 
depending on the structure of the sale  we may not be able to isolate ourselves from and may likely remain contingently liable for certain obligations and liabilities transferred as part of the j 
jill business  including those related to litigation  contracts  leases and other obligations 
if there were to occur any material default on any such obligation following a sale which the buyer fails to satisfy or fully indemnify us against  it could have a material negative impact on us 
further  while the terms of leases generally permit transfers of leases without third party consent under specified conditions  which vary from lease to lease  there can be no assurance that those conditions will apply in each case 
furthermore  with respect to a buyer of the j 
jill business  we would need to rely on that party s creditworthiness as a counterparty 
our level of indebtedness impacts our ability to respond to the changes in the economy 
our current level of indebtedness requires significant interest payments and will require substantial principal repayment  when and as due  which reduces the funds available for other purposes  limits our ability to obtain additional financing  and makes us more susceptible to further declines in economic conditions and to a lengthy recessionary cycle 
further  additional debt levels will increase our debt service costs and  absent improvement in general economic conditions and in consumer discretionary spending  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations including our debt service obligations 
there is no assurance that we will at all times be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations for these debt obligations and our other obligations  in which event we would be required to seek additional debt or equity financing  including seeking to sell  collateralize or securitize certain of our assets  which may not be available at the times or amounts needed 
we are subject to credit risk and to potential increased defaults and delinquencies on our customer charge card account portfolio 
we extend credit to our customers for merchandise purchases through our proprietary charge card facilities 
while we monitor our charge card account portfolio and we believe that our charge card account portfolio continues to be sound  the deteriorated economic environment and increasingly high levels of unemployment may lead to higher customer delinquencies and defaults 
there can be no assurance that our credit risk monitoring or our monitoring of our charge card account portfolio will guard against or enable us to adequately and timely respond to any increased risk of or actual increased customer delinquencies or defaults  which could materially and negatively impact the value of our charge card portfolio  our results of operations and liquidity  and our ability to securitize that portfolio on favorable or acceptable terms 
any customer concerns with our long term sustainability as a business may impact our merchandise sales 
in addition to the significant negative impact on consumer discretionary spending resulting from the general economic conditions  if our customers perceive any uncertainty as to our long term success  profitability or sustainability  they may choose to spend less with us  including purchases of our gift cards redeemable for merchandise in the future  which accounts for significant sales particularly during holiday selling seasons 
any such decrease in consumer spending in our stores or over the internet would negatively impact our sales  results of operations and cash flows 
if we do not meet the nyse continued listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted 
if we do not meet the new york stock exchange nyse continued listing requirements  the nyse may take action to delist our common stock 
the continued listing requirements of the nyse applicable to us require  among other things  that the average closing price of our common stock be above over consecutive trading days and that the average global market capitalization over a consecutive trading day period be at least million 
the application of the continued listing requirement regarding average closing price has been suspended temporarily until june   but there can be no assurance that the nyse will extend this temporary suspension beyond that date 
if we are notified by the nyse that we have not met continued listing requirements  we generally would have a six month period to take action to meet the minimum price requirements  and potentially up to an eighteen month period to take action to meet minimum market capitalization requirements  before our common stock could be suspended for trading or delisted  subject to continued compliance with other nyse continued listing criteria 
we would intend to take steps to cure any such non compliance should we fall below the nyse s requirements  but if at the end of any cure period  we are unable to satisfy the nyse criteria for continued listing  our common stock would be subject to delisting 
even if a listed company meets the numerical continued listing criteria  the nyse reserves the right to assess the suitability of the continued listing of a company on a case by case basis whenever it deems appropriate and will consider factors such as unsatisfactory financial condition or operating results 
a delisting of our common stock would negatively impact us by  among other factors  reducing the liquidity and likely market price of our common stock and reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock  each of which would negatively impact our stock price as well as our ability to raise equity financing 
our loan agreements contain provisions which may restrict our operations and proposed financing and strategic transactions 
there are various covenants and other restrictions in our loan agreements which among other things restrict our ability to pay dividends and restrict our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of or pledge or collateralize certain assets  or engage in mergers or other business combinations without lender consent 
under the terms of our term loan agreement with aeon  we are subject to mandatory prepayment obligations as follows of excess cash flow  of net cash proceeds of any sale of j 
jill and of net cash proceeds on any other asset sales or dispositions  and of net cash proceeds of any non related party debt issuances and of net cash proceeds of any equity issuances subject to such exceptions the lender may agree to 
in addition  under each of our aeon and aeon usa loan facilities  we may not incur  assume  guarantee or otherwise become or remain liable with respect to any indebtedness other than permitted indebtedness as defined in the agreement 
written consent of aeon in its discretion in its capacity as lender is required prior to incurrence of indebtedness  liens  fundamental changes including mergers  consolidations  etc  dispositions of property including sales of stock of subsidiaries  dividends and other restricted payments  investments  transactions with affiliates and other related parties  sale leaseback transactions  swap agreements  changes in fiscal periods  negative pledge clauses  and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions  all on terms and exceptions set forth in the loan agreements 
we are also limited in our ability to purchase or make commitments for capital expenditures in excess of amounts approved by aeon in its capacity as lender 
any of the above requirements could reduce our flexibility by limiting  without lender consent  our ability to borrow additional funds or enter into dispositions or collateralizations or securitizations of our assets or other significant transactions 
further  if we default under our loan agreements  any amounts outstanding could become due and payable prior to their maturity dates  in which case absent replacement financing we would not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy this debt 
due to cross default provisions in our loan agreements  a default under one of our loan agreements could be cause for the acceleration of outstanding debt under other of our loan agreements 
the million secured revolving loan has a maturity date of the earlier to occur of i april  or ii consummation of one or more securitization programs or structured loans by the company or its subsidiaries in an aggregate equivalent principal amount to the revolving loan commitment amount of million  approved in advance by the lender and in form and substance satisfactory to the lender 
we recently suspended payment of dividends on our common stock and we cannot predict when payment of dividends may resume  if at all 
as part of our strategic and cost saving initiatives  we announced on march  that we had suspended payment of the regular dividend on our common stock 
dividends on our common stock had been paid regularly since we began as a public company in there is no assurance as to when  if at all  we will resume dividend payments on our common stock 
payment of dividends is also subject to contractual restrictions under our term loans with aeon  and are also subject to restrictions and limitations under delaware corporate law and other applicable statutory and common law  which may limit payment of dividends in the future 
we may not be able to maintain proper inventory levels 
customer demand is difficult to predict since the design process begins well in advance of the date the products are to be sold 
we must anticipate trends and customer demand well ahead of time in order to accurately maintain inventory levels 
this lag in lead time makes responding to changes quickly difficult and any misjudgments in customer preferences can be detrimental to earnings as well as customer satisfaction 
in addition  we have and are continuing to take significant steps to improve inventory management  such as managing leaner inventories  changing our markdown cadence  and the implementation of a price optimizing software tool 
we cannot provide assurance that these steps will continue to be successful in improving merchandise gross margins 
moreover  inventory levels in excess of customer demand result in inventory markdowns and movement of the inventory to our outlet facilities to be sold at discount or closeout prices which would negatively impact operating results and could impair our brand image 
in contrast to that scenario  if we underestimate customer demand or for any other reason fail to supply adequate levels of quality products in a timely manner  we could experience inventory shortages resulting in missed sales opportunities  negative impact on customer loyalty and loss of revenues 
the inability to fill customer orders efficiently could lower customer satisfaction and could cause customers to go to an alternate source for the desired products 
this lowered level of customer satisfaction and improper inventory levels could adversely affect our operations 
we may continue to experience fluctuations in operating results 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are customers response to merchandise offerings  closing existing stores and concepts  the timing of merchandise receipts  changes in merchandise mix and presentation  our cost of merchandise  unanticipated operating costs  and other factors beyond our control  including the general economic conditions experienced over the past twelve months as well as actions of competitors 
as a result  period to period comparisons of historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
our overseas merchandise purchasing strategy makes it vulnerable to a number of risks 
we purchase a significant portion of our merchandise directly from foreign sources 
approximately of our talbots brand merchandise purchased in was purchased directly from foreign sources 
in addition  goods purchased from domestic vendors may be sourced abroad by such vendors 
as a result  our business remains subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as political and economic instability  imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods that may be imported into the us from countries in a region where we do business  imposition of duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  natural disasters and public health concerns  potential delays or disruption in shipping and related pricing impacts  and local business practices and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards 
we cannot predict whether the foreign countries in which our apparel and accessories are currently manufactured or any of the foreign countries in which our apparel and accessories may be manufactured in the future will be subject to import restrictions by the us government  including the likelihood  type or effect of any trade retaliation 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or more restrictive quotas  applicable to apparel items could affect the importation of apparel and  in that event  could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our operations 
we rely on third party manufacturers for our merchandise  including many foreign sources of merchandise 
we have an extensive  formal program requiring all of our manufacturers to comply with applicable labor laws and acceptable labor practices 
any failure to comply with applicable labor laws and practices by any of these manufacturers could materially harm our reputation with our customers as well as disrupt our supply of merchandise 
if we fail to maintain the value of our brand  sales are likely to decline 
our success will depend upon our ability to effectively define  evolve  and promote our talbots brand 
the talbots brand name and tradition transformed niche is integral to the success of our business 
maintaining  promoting  and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of the brand s design  merchandising  and marketing efforts and the ability to provide a consistent  high quality customer experience 
additionally  we may need to increase investments in the development of our brand through various means  including customer research  prospecting  advertising and promotional events  direct mail and internet marketing 
while we believe that our objectives will help to build brand awareness and attract new customers  we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient cash resources in fiscal necessary to further develop our brand or that our efforts will result in increased sales or profitability 
additionally  our brand could be adversely affected if our public image is tarnished by negative sales or poor operating performance 
talented personnel are critical to our success 
we cannot assure that the current management team or the additions to our executive leadership team will result in increased profitability for us 
our success and ability to properly manage our growth depends to a significant extent on both the performance of our current executive and senior management team and our ability to attract  hire  motivate  and retain qualified and talented management personnel in the future 
during and  we hired a number of new key senior executives in the areas of brand leadership  creative  merchandising  marketing  finance  sourcing  and merchandise inventory planning and allocation 
there can be no assurance that the new key hires will be successful in achieving better sales and other operating results or long term profitability for us 
our inability to retain key personnel  or the loss of service of any other key employees  would likely adversely impact our results of operations 
a major failure of our information systems could harm the business 
we depend on information systems to manage our operations 
our information systems consist of a full range of retail  financial  and merchandising systems  including credit  inventory distribution and control  sales reporting  accounts payable  budgeting and forecasting  financial reporting  merchandise reporting  and distribution 
we regularly make investments to upgrade  enhance  or replace such systems and believe they meet industry standards 
any delays or difficulties in transitioning to these new systems  or in integrating these systems with our current systems  or any disruptions affecting our information systems  could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
certain members of our board of directors are affiliated with our majority shareholder  which may create potential conflicts of interest 
from time to time we enter into transactions with aeon and its subsidiaries  including aeon usa certain of our directors  including the chairman of our board of directors  are executives of or otherwise affiliated with aeon and aeon usa as a result of these relationships  potential conflicts of interest may arise which could influence business decisions affecting us or transactions entered into between us and aeon and aeon usa and the terms of those transactions  including any loan or other similar arrangement 
in july  february  and april  we entered into loan agreements with aeon and aeon usa  the terms of which are described in current reports on form k filed on july   march   and april   respectively 
the principal terms of these transactions were reviewed with and approved by our independent audit committee  and we expect that any material arrangement entered into with aeon or aeon usa in the future would be similarly reviewed 
however  there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transaction or arrangement between aeon  or aeon usa and the company would be as favorable as any terms that could be achieved as the product of arms length negotiations with unaffiliated third parties 
related person transactions between us and aeon or aeon usa  as well as our policy and procedures for approving any related person transactions  are described in our proxy statements filed annually in connection with our annual meeting of shareholders 
the foregoing list of risk factors is not intended to be exhaustive 
we cannot assure that we have identified and discussed all of the significant factors which might affect our operations  results of operations or financial condition

we also recorded a valuation allowance of million which is included in discontinued operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should be read in conjunction with these statements and the notes thereto 
we follow the national retail federation s fiscal calendar 
where a reference is made to a particular year or years  it is a reference to our week or week fiscal year 
for example  and refers to the week fiscal year ended january  and february   respectively and refers to the week fiscal year ended february  operating results discussed below are from continuing operations  which include our talbots misses  petites  woman  collection  and accessories shoes concepts 
results from our kids  mens  uk  and j 
jill businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for   and and are discussed separately below 
comparable stores are those that were open for at least one full fiscal year 
when a new talbots petites store or talbots woman store is opened adjacent to or in close proximity to an existing comparable talbots misses store  such talbots misses store is excluded from the computation of comparable store sales for a period of months so that the performance of the full talbots misses assortment may be properly compared 
business overview overall  proved to be a challenging and disappointing year  especially in the back half of the year as the volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets reached unprecedented levels leading to the deterioration of the us economic environment 
consumers became cautious in their discretionary spending  significantly impacting our sales  operating results  and cash flows for the year and these conditions have continued into the first quarter of for the year ended january   our comparable store sales declined by 
we reported a net loss of million  which included restructuring charges of million  compared to net income of less than million in  including restructuring charges of million 
recent developments our industry has historically been impacted by economic recessions 
our results are dependent on a number of factors impacting consumer spending such as but not limited to the general economic outlook  consumer confidence  the level of customer traffic in our stores  wages and unemployment rates  the housing market  consumer debt levels  availability of consumer credit  and fuel and energy costs 
the current volatility of the us economic environment reached unprecedented levels in and has significantly adversely impacted economic conditions  resulting in significant recessionary pressures  declines in employment levels  lower disposable income  and declines in consumer confidence 
the current economic environment has been characterized by a significant decline in consumer discretionary spending and has particularly affected the fashion apparel industry 
we expect these economic conditions to continue throughout and possibly beyond 
this could lead to continued declines in consumer spending over the foreseeable future and will likely continue to have a material adverse impact on our business  liquidity  financial condition  and results of operations 
during  our sales declined by from the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  our comparable store sales were down and our total sales were down 
we believe this decline in sales will continue throughout and possibly beyond 
we have taken actions to reduce spending in an effort to offset the decline in sales and to realign our business accordingly 
however there can be no assurance that our actions will be sufficient to produce operating profits or positive operating cash flows 
see further discussion of management s plan in the liquidity and capital resource section below 
progress on our strategic plan in october  we initiated a comprehensive strategic review of our business and engaged a leading global consulting firm to assist us in developing a long range plan 
this review included the following areas brand positioning  productivity  store growth and store productivity  non core concepts  distribution channels  the j 
jill brand  and other operating matters 
the consulting firm completed its review in the first quarter of  from which we developed a three year strategic plan 
in april we announced our strategic plan for long term growth and significant productivity improvement 
given that the retail industry continues to face unprecedented uncertainty and volatility  we are focusing on what is within our control to best manage the business and at the same time we are staying the course in moving forward with the implementation of our strategic plan 
we are still in the early stages of implementation  given that this is a three year plan  and we have accomplished a great deal in redefining our business 
despite the environment  we are seeing certain positive signs from our efforts to rebuild and strengthen our company 
during  we focused on implementing strategic initiatives that we believe will have the most impact on the performance of our business  including streamlined operations  improved inventory management  improved product content and flow  and innovative marketing and customer contact programs 
redirecting resources and concentrating on reinvigorating and rebuilding our core talbots brand 
by the end of the third quarter of  we completed the closing of our kids  mens  and uk businesses 
in light of the current economic environment and after thorough strategic review of the businesses  we concluded that these non core businesses were not demonstrating sufficient potential to deliver acceptable long term return on investment 
additionally  in october  our board of directors approved the plan to sell the j 
jill business so that we may focus exclusively on our core brand 
further  as part of our strategic initiatives  we are monitoring stores in our talbots brand core concepts to identify stores that are underperforming and closing stores when appropriate 
we currently plan on closing approximately talbots brand stores in  of which a significant portion relate to lease renewals that will not be exercised 
we will continue to review our talbots brand store portfolio  which could lead to further store closings 
streamlining operations and improving overall reduction in cost structure 
in june  we executed our plan to reduce our corporate headcount by approximately across multiple locations and at all levels 
the reduction in headcount was intended to streamline operations and provide greater efficiencies throughout the organization 
additionally in february  we announced and executed our plan of reducing our corporate headcount by approximately  or approximately positions 
we believe this action will result in savings of approximately million 
improving inventory management 
despite the significant declines in store sales in especially in the fourth quarter  we were able to maintain merchandise gross margins relatively flat in comparison to we accomplished this though our efforts to improve inventory management and product content 
to effectively manage inventory levels  we changed our promotional cadence to monthly markdowns rather than our historical four clearance sales events  held a leaner inventory position  concentrated on better product flow and content  adopted a new price optimization tool  and presented a stronger visual presentation of our merchandise across all channels 
we believe that our continued efforts to effectively manage inventory will improve product margins in improving product content 
in the third quarter of  we presented our first product deliveries under the leadership of our new creative merchandising  and marketing teams that were formed in late and the talbots brand fall consumer purchase plan study revealed that customer reaction to our new redesigned fall merchandise improved over the fall of additionally  our study that was performed in january revealed that our new redesigned merchandise improved over fall of these are the first gains in positive customer sentiment since additionally  our new creative team has introduced our refreshed talbots brand image beginning in our june catalogs 
we believe that the redesigned catalogs have gained positive customer response 
in we also executed our strategy to ensure that our product is presented similarly across all channels in an effort to drive improved multi channel business 
innovating marketing and customer contact programs 
in an effort to drive customer traffic  we increased prospecting in we contacted our customer with greater frequency and with a variety of innovative offerings 
in the fall of  we increased total catalog circulation by to strengthen relations with existing customer  prospect new customers  and drive reactivation of our lapsed customer 
our efforts yielded a solid increase in response rate of our existing and lapsed customers 
in  in an effort to manage our spending  we plan to decrease catalog circulation to approximately million from million in although we have made progress in our strategic plan to rejuvenate our talbots brand and streamline our operations during  the ongoing impact of the global economic crisis on our business demanded that we take further immediate and decisive action to drive greater efficiencies throughout our organization

financing and cost reduction plan new financing 
in april of  we obtained a new million secured revolving loan facility from aeon which matures upon the earlier of i april  or ii one or more securitization programs or structured loans by the company or its subsidiaries in an aggregate equivalent principal amount to the revolving loan commitment amount  approved in advance by aeon and in form and substance satisfactory to the lender 
funding under this facility is subject to mortgage and lien recordings and all necessary consents or waivers by existing lenders to the transactions contemplated by the agreement  including the granting of liens and mortgages in favor of aeon under the facility  without such lender requiring prepayment of its indebtedness or the establishment of a pari passu lien on the collateral in favor of such lender 
amounts may be borrowed  repaid  and reborrowed under the facility and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in february of  aeon guaranteed our outstanding debt under our existing working capital facilities totaling million  our existing revolving credit facilities totaling million  and our existing million term loan facility 
in april of  aeon also agreed i that it would agree to continue to provide a guaranty for a refinancing of any of that debt  which currently matures at various dates on and prior to april  and ii if the lender failed to agree to refinance that debt on or before the existing maturity date  or if any other condition occurred that required aeon to make a payment under its existing guaranty  aeon would make a loan to us  due on or after april  and within the limits of aeon s existing loan guaranty  to avoid any lack of our financial resources caused by any such failure of refinancing

refinancing 
in february  we obtained a new million term loan facility from aeon  which was used to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the acquisition term loan agreement related to the j 
jill acquisition 
since the facility requires interest only payments until maturity in  we anticipate that the new loan will improve our fiscal cash flow by approximately million 
additionally  in  we completed the conversion of our million uncommitted working capital facilities to committed lines 
we believe that the conversion to committed lines provided us with greater stability in our liquidity position 
we are currently in discussion with our lenders to extend the commitment and maturity dates of these working capital facilities beyond the current december commitment termination dates  although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
expense reduction program in the amount of million 
we plan on continuing our major cost cutting initiatives in designed to further streamline our organization  substantially reduce selling  general  and administrative costs 
such initiatives included a reduction of approximately of our corporate headcount  as discussed above  changes to the employee related benefits including suspension of our matching contributions to the k plan  increased employee health care contributions  elimination of merit increases  and broad based  non employee overhead actions primarily in the areas of administration  marketing  and store operations  and the reduction of approximately in capital expenditures in in comparison to we expect our expense reduction program to contribute to cost savings of at least million in other liquidity and cash flow improvements 
in march we announced the indefinite suspension of our quarterly dividends  which is expected to result in million of cash savings in fiscal  and the freeze of the talbots define benefit pension plans  effective may   which is expected to result in million of expense savings in looking ahead to and beyond we were disappointed with our operating performance during however  we realize that the specialty apparel retail segment of the industry as a whole  experienced unfavorable results 
we believe that we are taking the appropriate steps to attempt to improve our performance in and beyond 
we believe that our success in the future will depend on our ability to navigate through an extremely difficult economic environment and challenging market conditions  execute on our strategic initiatives and cost reduction programs  design and deliver merchandise that is accepted by our customers  and source the manufacturing and distribution of our products on a more competitive and efficient basis 
as general consumer confidence strongly influences our operating results  it is difficult to ascertain if our initiatives will be achieved and whether we will be successful in achieving improved operating performance in and beyond 
results of operations cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses are comprised primarily of the cost of product merchandise  including inbound freight charges  shipping  handling and distribution costs associated with our catalog operations  salaries and expenses incurred by our merchandising and buying operations  and occupancy costs associated with our retail stores 
occupancy costs consist primarily of rent and associated depreciation  maintenance  property taxes  and utilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of the costs related to employee compensation and benefits in the selling and administrative support functions  catalog operation costs relating to catalog production and telemarketing  advertising and marketing costs  the cost of our customer loyalty program  costs related to management information systems and support  and the costs and income associated with our credit card operations 
additionally  costs associated with our warehouse operations are included in selling  general and administrative expenses and include costs of receiving  inspection  warehousing  and store distribution 
warehouse operations costs for  and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our gross margins may not be comparable to certain other companies  as there is diversity in practice as to which costs companies include in selling  general and administrative expenses and cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses 
specifically  we include the majority of the costs associated with our warehousing operations in selling  general and administrative expenses  while other companies may include these costs in cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses

retail stores retail store sales in decreased by million  or  in comparison to retail store sales in reflected in talbots retail store sales was a million  or  decline in comparable store sales for the period  driven by a decline in transactions 
we believe that the brand s negative sales results were impacted by a weak customer response to the brand s spring merchandise and timing of promotional events earlier in the year  coupled with the effects from the economic crisis and pressures on consumer spending later in the year 
we began to see a steep decline in customer traffic in mid september as the financial crisis unfolded 
throughout the remainder of the year  it was more challenging to drive customer traffic as we believe that our customer was becoming more cautious and thoughtful regarding her discretionary spending given the substantial economic uncertainty 
as a result  we were forced to become more promotional than originally planned which negatively impacted our margins 
despite the environment in the fall season  we did see a positive response to our reinvigorated merchandise and marketing efforts during that time 
the third quarter marked the first deliveries under the direction of our new creative  merchandising  and marketing teams 
the new deliveries in the fall season were complemented with new floor sets and major redesigned catalogs 
although we believe our improvements to the brand were received well by our customers  our sales could not withstand the continued deterioration and uncertainty of the us economy 
for the fourth quarter of  our comparable store sales declined 
as of january   we operated a total of retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
this represents a decrease of approximately in gross and selling square footage from february   when we operated retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
direct marketing sales direct marketing sales in decreased by million  or 
the decline in direct marketing sales was primarily due to the effects of the economic environment and a misjudgment in inventory commitments related to our sale book that dropped in december 
the catalog received a positive response and we were unable to fulfill approximately of customer demand from the sale book 
additionally  we shifted the mailing of our key holiday gift catalog into november this year versus october last year 
we expected this change to benefit our fourth quarter direct marketing sales 
because of the difficult economic environment  our fourth quarter results did not benefit from this change 
mainly because of these actions  we experienced a million decline in net sales in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year 
in  as part of our strategic initiatives  we increased circulation for the talbots brand and developed innovative marketing strategies in order to strengthen relations with our existing customer  prospect new customers and drive reactivation of our existing lapsed customer in hopes to drive catalog and internet channel sales 
we believe our efforts yielded a solid increase in response rate  especially with our existing lapsed customers 
the internet channel continues to be an important component of direct marketing sales  with internet representing of the direct business in in comparison to in we have made enhancements to our brand website in  offering enhanced visuals and greater ease of functionality and plan to create a fresh platform of our e commerce site in the percentage of our net sales derived from direct marketing increased slightly from in to in cost of sales  buying  and occupancy expenses cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to in  from in this represents a basis point increase in cost of sales  buying  and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales over the prior year with pure merchandise gross margin decreasing by approximately basis points 
despite the significant decline in sales  especially in the fourth quarter  our efforts in inventory management allowed us to maintain relatively flat product margins with the prior year 
our efforts included tight control of inventory levels  improved initial mark on  the change to a monthly markdown cadence  and a consistent flow of new merchandise across channels 
additionally  an approximate basis point increase was driven by higher occupancy costs as a percentage of sales 
as occupancy costs are primarily fixed costs  the basis point increase is fully attributable to the decline in sales for the period 
we also experienced an approximate basis point increase in merchandising costs as a percentage of sales  which is attributable to the deleverage associated with the decline in store sales for the period 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this represents a basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales over the prior year 
while we believe that we have made progress in executing our strategic initiatives  including streamlining the organization and reducing expenses for our overall company cost structure in  we had not yet begun to benefit from the implementations 
in we spent approximately million in business development costs  or approximately basis points  relating to non restructuring initiatives 
the costs were primarily relating to professional services 
any savings that we were able to achieve in were offset by negative leverage from the decline in sales during the period 
our primary area of savings in was due to our decision to eliminate television and national print advertising 
we spent million less  or approximately basis points  during for marketing programs in comparison to additionally  we reduced our vacation accrual by million in due to a change in our vacation policy that became effective on january  restructuring charges we incurred million and million of expense relating to our strategic business plan in and and have included these costs as restructuring charges within our consolidated statement of operations 
the million of restructuring changes in consisted of million of severance  million of professional services  offset by million of non cash credits related to stock awards that will not vest 
the million of restructuring charges in consisted of million of professional services  million of severance  and million of other non cash charges 
impairment of store assets impairment of store assets was million in compared to million in as part of our strategic initiatives  we are closely monitoring stores in our core concepts to identify stores that are underperforming and closing stores when appropriate 
when we determine that a store is underperforming or is to be closed  we reassess the expected future cash flows of the store  which in some cases results in an impairment charge 
goodwill and other intangible assets our policy is to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the beginning of our fiscal year and more frequently if event or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential decline in the fair value of the company 
in the third quarter of  our operating results were lower than expected 
based on this trend  we updated our forecasts during the third quarter 
management performed an interim impairment test on its goodwill and intangible assets 
we did not impair any goodwill or intangible assets associated with the talbots brand 
as a result of the significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization in the fourth quarter  we were required to perform an additional interim test for goodwill impairment 
in the fourth quarter  we finalized our budget and long term plan  evaluating current industry trends  and the impact that the uncertainty in the financial markets may have on our business and our impairment analysis 
our interim test in the fourth quarter did not require an impairment charge for our goodwill or any intangible assets associated with the talbots brand 
our industry continues to be materially impacted by the deterioration of the us economic environment and we believe that the effects will continue throughout as such  we may be required to perform additional tests of impairment on our goodwill and intangible assets which may result in significant charges 
as of january   our goodwill balance was million  and the balance of indefinite lived assets was million 
net interest expense net interest expense in decreased to million from million in this decrease was due to lower levels of gross borrowings as well as lower interest rates 
the average level of debt outstanding  including short term and long term borrowings  was million in compared to million in this includes an average level of short term working capital borrowings outstanding of million in compared to million in the average interest rate on short term and long term borrowings during was compared to in income tax expense the income tax expense in was million  compared to income tax expense of million in the income tax expense in reflects the establishment of valuation allowances for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated all of the positive and negative evidence related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and concluded that due to our recent significant losses and the uncertain economic environment that a valuation allowance of million was needed for continuing operations 
discontinued operations in january  we announced our decision to discontinue our talbots kids  mens  and uk businesses as a result of our comprehensive strategic review of the company 
as of the end of the third quarter of  all talbots kids  mens  and uk businesses ceased operations and all stores were closed 
their operating results for all periods shown have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
on october   our board of directors approved the plan to sell the j

retail stores retail stores sales in decreased by million  or  in comparison to retail store sales in reflected in talbots retail store sales was an million  or  decline in comparable store sales for the period 
we believe that our negative sales results were impacted by a weak customer response to our talbots merchandise  primarily our casual merchandise 
as a result  deeper discounts than planned were taken in order to liquidate the excess inventory during our mid season and semi annual sale events 
in november  we implemented a new promotional cadence strategy which provides for sale events on a monthly basis rather than our historical mid season and semi annual sale events 
partially offsetting the decline in comparable store sales was the increase in store sales driven by the increase in the number of retail stores 
as of february   we operated a total of retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
this represents an increase of approximately in gross and selling square footage from february   when we operated retail stores with gross and selling square footage of approximately million square feet and million square feet  respectively 
direct marketing sales direct marketing sales in slightly increased by million  or less than in comparison to direct marketing sales in the slight increase in direct marketing sales is attributable to the internet channel 
in august  we began selling clearance outlet merchandise via the internet which contributed to the increased internet sales

the decline in pure merchandise gross margin was primarily due to increased levels of markdown selling as compared to the prior year in an effort to clear out excess inventories from our mid season and semi annual sale events 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this represents a basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales over the prior year 
contributing to the increased selling  general  and administrative costs were higher incurred costs as a percentage of net sales  especially in the areas of payroll  including stores and corporate  and marketing costs  compounded by the decline in comparable store sales during the period 
additionally  during the third and fourth quarter of  we incurred expenses for executive compensation related to the commencement of employment of key members of our executive management team  including but not limited to the president and chief executive officer  appointment of our former chief operating officer  chief creative officer  and executive vice president  chief merchandising officer 
these expenses contributed to the increase by approximately basis points 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks and review annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we have selected the first day of each fiscal year as our annual measurement date 
we reviewed our goodwill and trademarks for impairment during the fourth quarter of in addition to our annual measurement date due to the weak sales and operating performance of the company 
no impairment charges were taken for the talbots brand 
impairment of store assets impairment of store assets was million in compared to less than million in as a result of the decline in sales performance during for our retail stores coupled with revised future projections  our impairment charge on store assets was increased from the prior year as well as historical levels 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in compared to in the restructuring charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of and related to our strategic business plan 
of the million  million relates to professional services  million relates to severance  and relates to other non cash charges net interest expense net interest expense in increased to million from million in in february  the company borrowed million under a short term facility in connection with the acquisition of j 
jill 
the interest cost associated with this debt was largely offset by the earnings on the invested cash until may   when the borrowed funds were used to acquire j 
jill  resulting in less net interest expense in compared to on july   the short term facility was converted into a five year term loan  bearing interest at a rate of libor plus an applicable rate of  with principal and interest due in quarterly installments 
our average level of debt outstanding  including short term and long term borrowings  as well as average interest rates on the borrowings  were relatively consistent in both periods  million in average borrowings in compared to million in average borrowings in  and average interest rates of in both periods 
additionally  a portion of the increase in interest expense was due to our election to change our financial statement classification for interest related to income taxes in connection with our adoption of fin no 
on february  we recorded million of tax related interest in net interest expense in  while no tax related interest was recorded in net interest expense in income tax expense income tax expense in was million compared to million in on february   we adopted fin no 
and elected to classify its interest related to income taxes in net interest expense rather than income tax expense 
in  million of tax related interest was recorded in net interest expense 
in  the tax related interest was reflected in income tax expense 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the nature of our business is to have two distinct selling seasons  spring and fall 
the first and second quarters of the fiscal year make up the spring season and the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year make up the fall season 
within the spring season  direct marketing sales are typically stronger in the first quarter  while retail store sales are slightly stronger in the second quarter 
within the fall season  both retail and direct marketing sales are generally stronger in the fourth quarter 
the sales patterns in were not indicative of historical patterns due to the deterioration and uncertainty in the us economy 
our fourth quarter sales represented a decline in comparable store sales and were the lowest dollar sales compared to the other three quarters during the year 
total sales for the fourth quarters of and were and  respectively  of total sales for the year 
the following table sets forth certain items in our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
the information as to any one quarter is not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

generally  we achieved this by conducting major sale events at the end of the second and fourth quarters  followed by clearance selling in our outlet stores 
in late  we changed our promotional strategy to provide markdowns on a monthly basis rather than our major sale events 
sales events and promotional activities generally produce an increase in sales volume  however  since marking down the value of inventory increases expense  our cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses increase as a percentage of net sales 
merchandise inventories typically peak in the third quarter in preparation for the fall and holiday season 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are generally highest in the first and third quarters as a result of sales volumes 
our results in did not follow our historical trends due to the general economic conditions 
sales significantly declined  especially in the fourth quarter of  causing deleverage in our percentage of sales calculations above 
the combined effect of the patterns of net sales  cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  described above  have historically produced higher operating income margins  as a percent of sales  in the first and third quarters 
in the future and beyond  we believe operating income margins  as a percent of sales  could be more consistent across quarters due to the change in merchandising strategy implemented at the end of liquidity and capital resources current liquidity position we finance our working capital needs  operating costs  capital expenditures  funding for our strategic initiatives and restructurings  and debt and interest payment requirements through cash generated by operations  access to working capital and other credit facilities  and credit from our vendors under open account purchases 
the substantial deterioration in the us economy and decline in consumer discretionary spending had a significant impact on our sales  operating profits and cash flows during these unfavorable economic conditions have continued into at the same or possible greater levels 
to date in  we have continued to incur net operating losses and our existing operations are not generating positive cash flows 
a continuation or further deterioration in global economic conditions will continue to have a negative impact on our business 
we expect that the current conditions in the global economy will continue during and possibly beyond 
during and we incurred significant net losses attributable to operations  some of which have been or are in the process of being discontinued 
also included in our net losses are charges related to impairments of intangible and tangible assets and restructuring charges 
the majority of our impairment charges relate to our j 
jill business 
our restructuring charges primarily relate to restructuring activities intended to reduce costs 
during our cash flows generated from operating activities from our continuing operations was million 
during  our cash generated from operating activities from continuing operations declined to million and we used cash from discontinued operations of million 
as of january   we had a working capital deficit of million and a stockholder s deficit of million 
in addition  as of january   we were in violation of certain financial covenants on our acquisition debt and we had substantial additional debt obligations coming due in the next twelve months 
we believe that the economic recession had a significant impact on our business during  especially during the fourth quarter of  in which sales declined by on a year over year basis 
in response to these short term liquidity needs  we took the following actions during and through april in an effort to improve our liquidity in july of  we entered into a million subordinated working capital term loan facility with aeon usa which matures in and is interest only until maturity 
as of january   we had drawn million on this facility and subsequent to january  we borrowed the remaining million available under the facility 
in february of  we obtained a new million term loan facility from aeon which was used to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness under our acquisition debt agreement related to the j 
jill acquisition 
the acquisition debt agreement required quarterly principal payments of million 
the new million loan from aeon is interest only until maturity 
the term loan facility matures on august   provided that we will have the option to extend the maturity for additional six month periods  up to the third anniversary of the loan closing date  which is february  there are no financial covenants associated with this debt 
as of february  we had converted all of our working capital lines  amounting to million in the aggregate  to committed lines with maturities in december we  with aeon  are currently in discussions with our lenders to extend the commitment expiration dates of these facilities  although there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
in february of  aeon guaranteed our outstanding debt under our existing working capital facilities totaling million  our existing revolving credit facilities totaling million  and our existing million term loan facility 
in april aeon also agreed i that it would agree to continue to provide a guaranty for a refinancing of any of that debt  which currently matures at various dates on and before april  and ii if the lender failed to agree to refinance that debt on or before the existing maturity date  or if any other condition occurred that required aeon to make a payment under its existing guaranty  aeon would make a loan to us  due on or after april  and within the limits of aeon s existing loan guaranty  to avoid any lack of our financial resources caused by any such failure of refinancing 
in april aeon also confirmed its support for our working capital improvements initiatives for our merchandise payables management and that it will use commercially reasonable effort to provide us with financial support through loan or guarantee up to million only if  and to the extent that  we may possibly fall short in achieving our targeted cash flow improvement for fall merchandise payables 
in april of  we entered into a million secured revolving loan facility with aeon 
the facility matures upon the earlier of i april  or ii one or more securitization programs or structured loans by the company or its subsidiaries in an aggregate equivalent principal amount to the revolving loan commitment amount  approved in advance by aeon as lender and in form and substance satisfactory to the lender 
funding under this facility is subject to mortgage and lien recordings and all necessary consents or waivers by existing lenders to the transactions contemplated by the agreement  including the granting of liens and mortgages in favor of aeon under the facility  without such lender requiring prepayment of its indebtedness or the establishment of a pari passu lien on the collateral in favor of such lender 
amounts may be borrowed  repaid  and reborrowed under the facility and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we have eliminated all financial covenant ratios from our debt agreements 
we are also actively in discussions with third parties concerning the securitization of our talbots charge card portfolio and we are exploring the availability and feasibility of collateralization of certain of our other assets as potential replacement financing to our million secured revolving loan facility with aeon 
while we currently believe that we will be able to obtain a securitization of our talbots charge card portfolio  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
if economic conditions persist or further deteriorate  it may also make these or other sources of liquidity more expensive or available only on terms that we may not find acceptable 
in addition to the short term liquidity actions described above  we have formulated additional responses to address current economic conditions and operating performance 
as part of our continuing strategic initiatives  we took the following actions in and to date in during the third quarter of we completed the closing of our kids  mens  and uk business concepts 
these business concepts were not considered strategic to ongoing operations 
during the third quarter of our board of directors approved a plan to sell the j 
jill business 
this business was not considered strategic to ongoing operations 
in june of we reduced our corporate headcount by approximately across multiple locations at all levels 
in february of we further reduced our corporate headcount by approximately 
we have reduced the planned hours worked in our stores for during and  we took the following actions in an effort to seek to improve our gross margins changed our promotional cadence to monthly markdowns rather than our historical four clearance sales events per year  held a leaner inventory position  concentrated on better product flow and content  and adopted a new price optimization tool 
we have decreased our planned inventory commitments for during we eliminated advertising in television and national print  contributing to million less in spending from we currently do not plan to resume advertising in television and national print in for  we plan to decrease catalog circulation to approximately million catalogs  down from approximately million in in  our gross capital expenditures excluding construction allowances received from landlords were million  which was down from by million 
for  we plan to further reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 
we currently expect to spend approximately million in gross capital expenditures in we have eliminated our matching contributions to our k plan for we have increased employee health care contributions in we have eliminated merit increases for we have frozen our defined benefit pension plans effective may  in february of our board approved the indefinite suspension of our quarterly dividend 
in addition  in april of we announced that we are in preliminary discussions with li fung  a global sourcing and trading consumer product firm based in hong kong  to mutually explore a potential outsourcing relationship 
while we cannot assure that an agreement will be entered into  we currently believe that a partnership with li fung could potentially create significant benefits by simplifying our sourcing processes  reducing operating expenses  potentially further reducing our cost of goods sold by leveraging li fung s extensive and diverse network of vendors  and potentially continuing our accounts payable management by extending payment terms with certain vendors and working with other vendors to maintain extended payment terms 
because economic conditions and discretionary consumer spending have not improved in the near term  we expect to continue to consider further realignment and rationalization initiatives and actions to further reduce and adjust our costs relative to our sales and operating results 
we also currently plan to close approximately underperforming talbots stores in  some of which relate to store leases that expire during and some of which are pursuant to existing early termination right provisions 
we will also continue to review store performance and expect to continue to close underperforming stores 
we also expect that we may need to close certain stores that may not be part of a j 
jill sale  the funding for which may be from net sale proceeds although there can be no assurance as to timing of any closings or funding from net sale proceeds 
our financial plan also includes projected store lease expense reductions through discussions and negotiations with our landlords  although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
we have the following payments due in the near term under our revolving credit facilities  unless extended million in december million in january  and million in april we also have third party working capital facilities  totaling million  with commitment expiration dates in december  unless extended 
together with aeon  we are currently in discussions with our lenders to extend the terms of each of the above credit facilities 
payment of all of the above indebtedness has been guaranteed to each lender by aeon 
we also have an million term loan secured by our tilton  nh facility that matures in june of our ability to obtain additional financing depends upon many factors  including our financial projections and our prospects and creditworthiness  as well as external economic conditions and general liquidity in the credit markets 
based on our current assumptions and forecast for  we believe that we have developed a fiscal financial plan that  if successfully executed  will provide sufficient liquidity to finance our anticipated working capital and other currently expected cash needs for fiscal while we expect to experience significant short term working capital shortfalls in the first half of  we believe that our new million secured revolving loan facility entered into with aeon  together with our april financial support letters from aeon referred to above as well as achieving our targeted cost reduction and cash flow improvements for fiscal  should address this shortfall 
due to the uncertainty in economic conditions  there can be no assurance that the current economic downturn and our sales trends and operating results may not continue longer than we expect or may not take longer to recover than we have planned or that we may not achieve such targeted cost and cash improvement goals  and as a result there can be no certainty our cash needs may not be greater than we anticipate or have planned for 
our ability to meet cash needs and to satisfy our operating and other non operating costs will depend upon our future operating performance as well as general economic conditions 
additional matters that could impact our liquidity include any further deterioration in the global economy  lower than expected sales  unforeseen cash or operating requirements  and any inability to access any necessary additional financing 
debt facilities we currently have working capital line of credit facilities with four banks with maximum available short term capacity of million in the aggregate 
these lines are committed through december of during  our average level of borrowings outstanding on these lines was million 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the company s borrowing and repayment patterns  the maturities on the lines are no longer short term in nature and accordingly have been shown gross on the statement of cash flows 
since november of  we have been fully drawn on our availability under our working capital lines 
a portion of our working capital lines is at times not available for borrowing as it is allocated to letters of credit for merchandise and other vendors 
we expect that we will continue to be fully drawn on these working capital line of credit facilities through all of interest on the line of credit facilities is at a variable rate based on the lenders cost of funds plus an amount not lower than and not higher than 
as of january   the average interest rate on these working capital borrowings outstanding was 
during  we will pay interest on our working capital borrowings as it comes due  generally in interest periods that range from one to three months 
in february of  aeon guaranteed each of these working capital facilities 
we are currently in discussions with our lenders to extend the commitment expiration dates of these facilities  although there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
in april of we entered into a million secured revolving loan facility with aeon 
the facility matures upon the earlier of i april  or ii one or more securitization programs or structured loans by the company or its subsidiaries in an aggregate equivalent principal amount to the revolving loan commitment amount  approved in advance by aeon as lender and in form and substance satisfactory to the lender 
funding under this facility is subject to mortgage and lien recordings and all necessary consents or waivers by existing lenders to the transactions contemplated by the agreement  including the granting of liens and mortgages in favor of aeon under the facility  without such lender requiring prepayment of its indebtedness or the establishment of a pari passu lien on the collateral in favor of such lender 
amounts may be borrowed  repaid  and reborrowed under the facility and may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
interest on outstanding borrowings is at a variable rate at one month libor plus payable monthly in arrears 
the facility contains an upfront fee of of the commitment prior to borrowing 
the facility is secured by our talbots charge card accounts receivable  our hingham  massachusetts owned corporate headquarters  and our lakeville  massachusetts owned distribution facility 
we have agreed to keep the mortgaged properties in good repair  reasonable wear and tear expected  and will ensure that at least million of talbots charge card receivables are owed to us and that at least of such talbots charge card receivables are eligible receivables  as defined in the agreement  arise in the ordinary course of business  and are owned free and clear of all liens  except permitted liens  measured as of the last day of any calendar month 
in february of  we entered into a million bridge loan agreement in connection with our acquisition of j 
jill 
in july of  the bridge loan was converted into a term loan the acquisition debt 
pursuant to the acquisition debt agreement  we borrowed million to be repaid no later than july of interest on the acquisition debt was libor plus  and the principal was due to be repaid in quarterly installments of million through july of in february of  we entered into a million term loan agreement with aeon 
the proceeds from the loan were used in february of to repay the remaining million balance outstanding on the acquisition debt 
the million term loan with aeon matures in february of we do not expect to repay any outstanding principal under this facility during  except as would be required under the agreement for any excess cash flows  net proceeds from the sale of j jill or other assets  or non related party debt or equity financings  in each case  at the prepayment percentage levels as defined in the agreement 
interest on the million aeon term loan is at a variable rate equal to six month libor plus 
interest is due semi annually  in august and february  in arrears 
the loan does not contain any financial ratio covenants 
in july of we entered into a million unsecured subordinated working capital term loan facility with our majority shareholder  aeon usa we borrowed million on this facility in january of and we borrowed the remaining million in february of these borrowings were utilized for working capital needs 
we do not expect to repay any amounts on this facility during the debt facility matures in january of interest on outstanding principal under the facility is at a variable rate equal to three month libor plus 
as of january   the interest rate on this facility was 
during  we will pay interest on the million as it comes due  which will be in quarterly increments 
in march of  the agreement was amended to remove the financial ratio covenants 
we expect to be fully borrowed on this facility in we have revolving credit facilities with three banks with outstanding borrowings of million in the aggregate 
of the million  million is due in december of  million is due in january of  and million is due in april of interest on the revolving credit facilities are at variable rates of libor  libor  and federal funds and are set at the company s option  for periods of one  three  or six months payable in arrears 
in february of  aeon guaranteed each of these revolving credit facilities 
we are currently in discussions with our lenders to extend the maturity dates of these facilities  although there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
we have a million term loan with one bank that is due in april of interest is paid semi annually in arrears at a rate that is fixed at 
in february of aeon guaranteed this term loan 
as part of the j 
jill acquisition  we assumed a real estate loan the tilton facility loan 
payments of principal and interest on the tilton facility loan are due monthly with a balloon payment of million that was originally due on april  in april of  we extended the maturity date of the loan to june  the interest rate on the tilton facility loan is fixed at per annum 
all of our merchandise is manufactured to our specifications by third party suppliers and intermediary vendors  most of whom are located outside the united states 
historically  a significant portion of our merchandise purchases had been pursuant to and secured by letter of credit arrangements in favor of our foreign suppliers and vendors and their credit sources 
beginning more than a year ago we moved substantially all of our merchandise vendors to open account purchase terms with payments approximately days after shipment 
in order to more effectively manage our accounts payable and cash positions due to our sales trends and cash needs  during the second half of and into we extended many of our accounts payable terms to approximately days 
this has improved our cash position and accounts payable management and we currently intend to continue this accounts payable and cash management going forward  but has increased pressure from vendors for payment in accordance with terms 
cash flows we finance our working capital needs  operating costs  capital expenditures  funding for our strategic initiatives and restructurings  and debt and interest payment requirements through cash generated by operations  access to working capital and other credit facilities  and credit from our vendors under open account purchases 
the substantial deterioration in the us economy and decline in consumer discretionary spending had a significant impact on our sales  operating profits and cash flows during during  we generated cash flows from operations from continuing operations of million 
however  we used cash from discontinued operations of million for a net use of funds of million 
we borrowed million on our working capital lines and million on our million aeon working capital term loan facility to pay down million in required debt principal payments  fund our dividends of million  fund our capital expenditures of million  and fund our operating loss 
we are currently fully drawn on all of our above debt facilities excluding our new million secured revolving loan from aeon 
the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows in thousands for   and from continuing operations january  february  february  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash provided by operating activities our primary source of operating cash flows is the sale of merchandise to customers  while the primary use of cash in operations is to fund the purchase of our merchandise inventories 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in operating cash flow generated during as compared to primarily reflects our significant decline in sales 
decreased accounts payable balances led to a decrease in cash of million compared to an increase in cash of million in in  in an effort to control costs and improve liquidity  we are maintaining leaner inventory levels  which results in lower inventories and lower accounts payable levels in in comparison to inventory levels at january  are million or lower than at february  during the latter half of and into  we extended payment terms in order to respond to our cash needs and for better accounts payable and cash management which we currently plan to continue going forward 
we recorded an income tax receivable in the amount of million in  which resulted in a decrease in operating cash flows 
in  we elected to carry back our loss to the and tax years in order to recover income taxes paid in those years 
we currently expect to receive this receivable by the end of the first quarter of accounts receivable decreased by million in compared to an increase of million in as a result of decreased talbots charge sales during cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities is primarily used for purchases of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this decline in investing activities was a result of our planned decline in spending on new store openings  store renovations  and information technology due to the uncertain economic environment of late during  we spent approximately million on new store openings and expansions and renovations of existing stores 
during  we spent approximately million on new store openings and expansions and renovations of existing stores 
in an effort to further improve liquidity  we have decided to further reduce our capital spending in we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures in primarily to support the expected rollout of our new upscale outlet stores  a platform refresh our e commerce site and renovation and refurbishment of certain of our existing store base 
cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million during compared to cash used in financing activities of million during our primary source of funds during was proceeds from our short term working capital facilities 
during  in order to fund our operating losses  we borrowed million in short term working capital facilities and repaid million for net borrowings during the year of million 
during  we had an average of million outstanding under our working capital facilities  in comparison to million outstanding during in addition  in the fourth quarter we received proceeds of million from our subordinated working capital term loan facility with aeon usa that was entered into in july our primary use of financing funds during and was to pay down million of our acquisition debt 
the acquisition debt was required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of million over the five year term  ending in july in february  we received a million term loan facility from aeon that was used to pay down our acquisition debt in full 
therefore  we are no longer required to pay million each quarter 
the million term loan facility bears interest semi annually and principal payments are not required until its maturity date in additionally  during and  we paid million and million  respectively  in dividends 
the dividends were paid at a rate of per share per quarter 
in february  our board of directors approved the suspension of our quarterly dividend indefinitely 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the applicable balance sheets and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the applicable reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  retirement plans  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
the estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
however  there is no assurance that such judgments and estimates will reflect actual results or that such estimates or their underlying assumptions may not need to change materially in the future to reflect actual experience 
inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant asset on our balance sheet  representing approximately of total assets at january  historically  we managed our inventory levels by typically holding four major sale events per year in stores and catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
these events served to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remaining goods were transferred to our outlet stores 
in november  we changed our markdown cadence from our historical four clearance events per year to markdowns on a monthly basis 
consistent with the retail inventory method  at the end of each reporting period  reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown past season inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of markdown inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise 
the future markdown rate is reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
historically  the difference between management s estimates and actual markdowns has not been significant 
if market conditions were to further decline or customer acceptance of product was not favorable  we may have excess inventory on hand and may be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
we believe that at january  and february   the markdown reserve was appropriate based on current markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends  and forecasts of future sales of markdown inventory 
the markdown reserve rate at january  and february  was and  respectively  of past season markdown inventory 
a basis point increase or decrease in this rate would impact pre tax income by approximately million in both and sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns through both of our catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels  and projected future return levels 
the sales return reserve calculation consists of two separate components 
the stores component is based on an analysis that tracks daily sales over the preceding six month period and actual returns processed against those sales 
a six month rolling average return rate is applied against the actual sales and the difference between the estimated returns and actual returns is booked as a reserve 
the model also applies a component to reduce the reserve for returns that result in merchandise exchanges 
these types of returns are tracked by the store systems and the estimate is applied against the return reserve 
the direct marketing component is based on a similar process except that sales are tracked by catalog and return rates are based on forecasted estimates for the entire life of the catalog and are based on current and historical return experience 
periodically both components of the calculation are validated by comparing the assumptions used to the actual returns processed 
historically  the difference between estimated sales returns and actual returns has not been significant 
if customer acceptance of the product was not favorable or the product quality were to deteriorate  future actual returns may increase  resulting in a higher return rate and increased charges to earnings 
we believe that the reserve balances at january  and february   of million and million  respectively  were appropriate based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
customer loyalty program 
we maintain a customer loyalty program referred to as our classic awards program in which talbots us brand customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching specified purchase levels 
our classic awards program was relaunched in january with the addition of non charge based loyalty incentives and additional incentives for customers who spend more than  per year on their talbots charge card 
prior to january  our classic awards program was only available to our customers who used talbots charge cards for their purchases and the incentives were the same for everyone  regardless of annual spend 
our classic awards program has three defined tiers of participation  each of which enables our customers to earn points for every purchase made with us  whether in store  online or via catalog 
once a customer earns points  they receive a appreciation award to be redeemed on a future merchandise purchase 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
other benefits of classic awards membership include birthday bonus percentage off coupons and other special offers and promotions such as double points 
the three tiers of our classic awards program include classic awards red purchases are not required to be made on a talbots charge card  and customers earn rewards for merchandise purchases regardless of their method of payment 
members receive a point for every spent 
classic awards platinum customers are enrolled automatically when they open a talbots charge card  and customers earn rewards for merchandise purchases made with their talbots charge card 
members receive point for every spent 
classic awards black comprised of customers who spend a minimum of  annually on their talbots charge card  and customers earn rewards for merchandise purchases made with their talbots charge card 
members receive points for every spent 
customers who are talbots charge card holders may enroll in classic awards red if they wish to earn points on purchases that are not made using their talbots charge card 
appreciation award expense is recognized at the time of the initial customer purchase and is charged to selling  general and administrative expenses based on purchase levels  actual awards issued  and historical redemption rates 
each month  we perform an analysis of the accrual account balance for each of the three tiers and factor in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions  and the level of award points earned  and based on that analysis  adjust the respective liability and expense as applicable by tier 
we also perform a monthly analysis of issuances and redemptions to identify trends in the redemption rate 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percentage of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales  and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates used in our liability analysis based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
we believe that the accrual balances at january  and february  were appropriate based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
a change in redemptions or issuances would have changed pre tax income by approximately million in and  respectively 
retirement plans 
we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time talbots brand and shared service employees  two non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans collectively  the serp for certain talbots brand current and former key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and we provide certain medical benefits for most talbots brand retired employees under postretirement medical plans 
in  we elected to close participation in the pension plan for all associates hired after december  in february  we announced our decision to freeze the pension plan and serp effective may  in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to our plan participants and allocating this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
in prior years  the plans were valued annually as of december st 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the measurement date was changed to our fiscal year end  and as such  the plans were valued as of january  for  resulting in a charge of million to retained earnings 
as a result of the decision made in february to freeze the plans  a remeasurement will occur using new assumptions which could have a significant impact on the expense for fiscal year significant assumptions related to the calculation of our obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase by certain plan participants  and the assumed healthcare trend rates on the postretirement medical plans 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based  in part  upon a discount rate modeling process that involves applying a methodology which matches the future benefit payment stream to a discount curve yield for the plan 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our obligation and periodic expense attributable to its employee benefits plans 
at january  and december   the discount rate used for the pension plan was 
the discount rates used for the serp were and at january  and december   respectively 
to the extent that the discount rate increases or decreases  our obligations are decreased or increased accordingly 
a basis point decrease in the discount rates utilized would have impacted our pre tax income by approximately million in and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based on an analysis which considers actual net returns for the pension plan since inception  ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the three major classes of investments in which we invest debt  equity  and foreign securities for the period since the pension plan s inception and for the longer period commencing when the return data was first tracked  and expectations of future market returns from outside sources for the three major classes of investments in which we invest 
this rate is utilized primarily in estimating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over approximately five years 
we utilized a rate of at january  and at december   respectively  as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have impacted our pre tax income by million in and  respectively 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is based on historical and expected compensation increases 
we utilized a rate of for both periods beginning december  and december  this rate is utilized principally in estimating the retirement obligation and annual expense 
an increase in the assumed average rate of compensation increase from to would have impacted our pre tax income by million in and million in the assumed health care expense trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical plans 
the healthcare cost escalation rate is used to determine the postretirement obligation and annual expense 
at january  and december   we used and  respectively  as initial cost escalation rates that gradually trend down to 
to the extent that these rates increase or decrease  our obligation and associated expense are increased or decreased accordingly 
a increase in the assumed health care trend rate would have no material impact on our pre tax income in or at january  and december   we believe that the assumptions used in the calculation of our retirement plans and postretirement medical plan liabilities were reasonable 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically review the period of depreciation or amortization for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine whether current circumstances warrant assessment of potential impairment of our carrying value 
we monitor the carrying value of our assets for potential impairment based primarily on projected future cash flows 
if an impairment is identified  the carrying value of the asset is compared to its estimated fair value and provisions for impairment are recorded as appropriate 
impairment losses are significantly impacted by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value 
our estimates of future operating cash flows are based upon our experience  knowledge  and expectations 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as our future operating results  future store profitability  and future economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
additionally  our initiative to continue to critically assess individual store profitability on an ongoing basis in an effort to restore profitability could result in an increased number of stores closed  resulting in a larger impairment charge against the carrying value of the associated store assets in future periods 
we recorded impairment charges relating to store assets in the amount of million  million  and less than million during   and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we test our goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level  on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we have elected the first day of each fiscal year as our measurement date 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the activities in the second step include valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the impaired reporting unit based on their fair value and determining the fair value of the impaired reporting unit s goodwill based upon the residual of the summed identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
in performing our impairment tests related to goodwill  we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and a market value approach 
the discounted cash flow approach uses a reporting unit s projections of estimated operating results and cash flows and applies a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
a key assumption in our fair value estimate is the weighted average cost of capital used for discounting our cash flow projections 
we believe the rate we used is consistent with the risks inherent in our business and with the retail industry 
the market value approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating characteristics of the reporting units 
the evaluation of goodwill requires us to use significant judgments and estimates  including but not limited to market multiples  projected future revenues and expenses  changes in gross margins  cash flows  and estimates of future capital expenditures 
our estimates may differ from actual results due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially affect our future financial results 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment of goodwill 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a negative change in our assumptions  as follows  would not have resulted in a change in conclusion in increase in the discount rate  decrease in the market approach multiple  decrease in forecasted earnings 
trademarks that have been determined to have indefinite lives are also not subject to amortization and are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment 
the fair value of our trademarks are estimated and compared to their carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
this approach is dependent on a number of factors  including estimates of future sales  royalty rates in the category of intellectual property  discount rates  and other variables 
significant differences between these estimates and actual results could materially affect our future financial results 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment of trademarks 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a negative change in our assumptions  as follows  would have resulted in the following additional impairment charges in additional impairment charge increase in discount rate no effect basis point decrease in royalty rate million decrease in revenue growth rate no effect as our industry continues to be materially impacted by the deterioration of the us economic environment  effects we believe will continue into  we may be required to perform additional interim tests of impairment on our goodwill and intangible assets which may result in significant charges 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

in accordance sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and respective tax basis  as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods where deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
we also assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and adjust the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including recent earnings results  expectations of future taxable income  carry forward periods available  and other relevant factors 
changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in the period that the determination is made 
we determined in that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits from our deferred tax assets  and have recorded a valuation allowance for substantially all of our net deferred tax assets  after considering sources of taxable income from reversing deferred tax liabilities 
we are routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
there is significant judgment that is required in determining our provision for income taxes  such as our mix and level of earnings  changes in tax laws or rates  changes in the expected outcome of audits  the expiration of the statute of limitations on some tax positions  and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause us to change our estimates 
changes in estimates may create volatility in our effective tax rate in future periods and may materially affect our results of operations 
we believe that as of january  and february   our accruals for income taxes are appropriate 
we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on february  fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as of january  and february   the total amount of accrued tax related interest and penalties included in other liabilities was as follows tax related interest of million and million  respectively  and penalties of million and million  respectively 
there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
we have assessed our income tax positions and recorded tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  the associated interest and penalties have also been recognized 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
to calculate the fair value of options  we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated expected volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  the expected dividend rate  and the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon bond issues with a term approximately equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules  historical exercise patterns  and expectations of future exercise patterns 
the expected volatility of our common stock price is based primarily upon historical volatilities of our stock from public data sources and also considers implied factors that may influence our volatility 
the expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated annual payment of dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on data derived from public sources regarding us treasury zero coupon bond issues 
our estimates of expected volatility and expected life have the greatest impact on determining the fair value of options granted 
if the expected volatility or expected life were to increase  the fair value of the stock award would be higher resulting in increased compensation charges 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we utilized different assumptions  the recorded stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
the fair values of nonvested stock awards and restricted stock units are based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and the related stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the vesting period on awards granted as performance accelerated nonvested stock is a five year period  but can be accelerated to three years after the grant date depending on the achievement of certain corporate financial goals 
if we determined that the achievement of certain corporate financial goals was going to occur where it had previously concluded that achievement of such goals would not occur  then the vesting period would be reduced at that time and the future related expense amounts would increase 
certain other shares of nonvested stock are time vested generally between periods of two to four years 
restricted stock units generally vest over one year 
in addition  an estimated forfeiture rate is applied in the recognition of the compensation charge 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior 
we compare actual forfeitures with estimates and revise our estimates if differences occur 
if actual forfeitures rates are lower than our estimates  our compensation expense would increase 
conversely  if actual forfeitures are greater than our estimates  our compensation expense would decrease 
our results of operations will be impacted by differences between estimated and actual forfeitures 
a decrease in the assumed forfeiture rate would have decreased our pre tax income by less than million in and million in the future impact of the cost of share based compensation on our results of operations  including net income and earnings per diluted share  will depend on  among other factors  the level of the company s equity awards in the future as well as the market price of shares at the time of award as well as various other assumptions used in valuing such awards
