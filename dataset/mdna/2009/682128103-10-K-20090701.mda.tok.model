item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop and market high performance  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main products  image sensing devices which we refer to as camerachip image sensors  capture an image electronically and are used in a number of consumer and commercial mass market applications 
our image sensors are manufactured using the cmos fabrication process and are predominantly single chip solutions that integrate several distinct functions including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of a fully processed image or video stream 
recently  we have also integrated our image sensors with wafer level optics  which we refer to as cameracube imaging devices 
our cameracube imaging device is a small footprint  total camera solution that we believe will enable the further miniaturization of camera products 
we believe that our highly integrated image sensors and imaging devices enable camera device manufacturers to build high quality camera products that are smaller  less complex  more reliable  more cost effective and more power efficient than cameras using traditional ccds 
current economic environment we operate in a challenging economic environment that has undergone significant changes in technology and in patterns of global trade 
we remain a leader in the development and marketing of image sensing devices based on the cmos fabrication process and have benefited from the growing market demand for and acceptance of this technology 
recently  general domestic and global economic conditions have been negatively impacted by several factors  including  among others  the subprime mortgage crisis in the housing market  going concern threats to investment banks  other financial institutions and major automobile companies  reduced corporate and consumer spending  and decreased consumer confidence 
these economic conditions have resulted in our facing one of the most challenging periods in our history 
in particular  we believe consumers and businesses in markets into which we sell our products have reduced spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and the continued uncertainty of the global economy 
this is negatively affecting demand for all consumer electronic products  security products and products for the automotive industry 
consequently  the overall demand for image sensors has also decreased 
this decrease in demand is having a significant impact on our revenues  results of operations and overall business 
our revenues for the three month period ended april  were lower than similar historical periods 
we believe the weakened global economy will continue to have a negative impact on our business 
we expect that our revenues in the three month period ending july   will be higher than our reported revenues for the three month period ended april   but will be substantially lower than our reported revenues for the same period a year ago 
these conditions could also have a number of additional effects on our business  including insolvency of key suppliers or manufacturers  resulting in product delays  inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products  customer insolvencies  increased pricing pressures  restructuring expenses and associated diversion of management s attention  excess inventory and increased difficulty in accurately forecasting product demand and planning future business activities 
it is uncertain how long the current economic conditions will last or how quickly any subsequent economic recovery will occur 
if the economy or markets into which we sell our products continue to 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued slow or any subsequent economic recovery is slow to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be further materially and adversely affected 
market environment we sell our products worldwide directly to oems  which include branded customers and contract manufacturers  and vars  and indirectly through distributors 
in order to ensure that we address all available markets for our image sensors  we organize our marketing efforts into end use market groups  each of which concentrates on a particular product or  in some cases  customer within a product group 
thus we have marketing teams that address the mobile phone market  the notebook and webcam market  the dsc market  the security and surveillance market  the toys and games market  and the automotive and medical markets 
in the mobile phone market in particular  future revenues depend to a large extent on design wins where  on the basis of an exhaustive evaluation of available products  a particular mobile phone maker determines which image sensor to design into one or more specific models 
the time lag between design win and volume shipments varies from as little as three months to as much as twelve months  which could cause an unexpected delay in generating revenues  especially during periods of product transitions 
design wins are also an important driver in the many other markets that we address  and in some cases  such as automotive or medical applications  the time lag between a particular design win and first revenue can be longer than one year 
the overwhelming majority of sales of our products depend on decisions by the engineering designers for manufacturers of products that incorporate image sensors to specify one of our products rather than one made by a competitor 
in most cases  the decision to specify a particular image sensor requires conforming other specifications of the product to the chosen image sensor and makes subsequent changes both difficult and expensive 
accordingly  the ability to timely produce and deliver reliable products in large quantities is a key competitive differentiator 
since our inception  we have shipped more than one billion image sensors  including approximately million in fiscal we believe that these quantities demonstrate the continuing capabilities of our production system  including our sources of offshore fabrication 
we currently outsource the wafer fabrication and packaging of our image sensor products to third parties 
we outsource the color filter and micro lens phases of production to an investee joint venture company 
with our new cameracube products  we also collaborated with the industry s leading wafer level lens suppliers  and outsourced the assembly process 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development  marketing and testing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
to increase and enhance our production capabilities  we work closely with tsmc  our principal wafer supplier and one of the largest wafer fabrication companies in the world  to increase  as necessary  the number of its fabrication facilities  at which our products can be produced 
visera  our joint venture with tsmc  and our investments in three key back end packaging suppliers are part of a broad strategy to ensure that we have sufficient back end capacity for the processing of our image sensors in the various formats required by our customers 
we currently perform the final testing of the majority of our products at our own facility in china 
as necessary  we will make further investments to expand our testing and production capacity as well as our overall capability to design additional custom products for our customers 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued since our end user customers market and sell their products worldwide  our revenues by geographic location are not necessarily indicative of the geographic distribution of end user sales  but rather indicate where the products and or their components are manufactured or sourced 
the revenues we report by geography are based on the country or region in which our customers issue their purchase orders to us 
many of the products using our image sensors  such as mobile phones  notebook and webcams  dscs and cameras for toys and games  are consumer electronics goods 
these mass market camera devices generally have seasonal cycles which historically have caused the sales of our customers to fluctuate quarter to quarter 
historically  demand from oems and distributors that serve such consumer product markets has been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
however  because of the current economic downturn  we experienced weaker than normal conditions in all of these markets in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal with limited visibility  we do not know when our business will return to a more predictable cyclical pattern 
in addition  since a very large number of the manufacturers who use our products are located in china  hong kong and taiwan  the pattern of demand for our image sensors has been increasingly influenced by the timing of the extended lunar or chinese new year holiday  a period in which the factories which use our image sensors generally close 
we believe that the market opportunity represented by mobile phones remains very large  although the opportunities presented will be deferred until the current global economic conditions improve 
we also believe that  like the dsc market  mobile phone and notebook and webcam demand will not only continue to shift toward higher resolutions  but also will increasingly fragment into multiple market segments with differing product attributes 
for example  we see the further expansion of the smartphone segment within the mobile phone market and the recent introduction of the netbook product segment within the notebook computer market 
in addition  there is increased demand for customization  and several different interface standards are coming to maturity 
all of these trends will require the development of an increasing variety of products 
as the markets for image sensors have grown  we have experienced competition from manufacturers of cmos and ccd image sensors 
our principal competitors in the market for cmos image sensors include aptina imaging  samsung  sharp  sony  stmicroelectronics and toshiba 
we expect to see continued price competition in the image sensor market for mobile phones  notebook and webcams and digital cameras as those markets continue to grow 
although we believe that we currently compete effectively in those markets  our competitive position could be impaired by companies that have greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing and distribution resources  broader product lines  better access to large customer bases  greater name recognition  longer operating histories and more established strategic and financial relationships than we do 
such companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
many of these competitors own and operate their own fabrication facilities  which in certain circumstances may give them the ability to price their products more aggressively than we can or may allow them to respond more rapidly than we can to changing market opportunities 
in addition  from time to time  other companies enter the cmos image sensor market by using obsolete and available manufacturing equipment 
while these efforts have rarely had any long term success  the new entrants do sometimes manage to gain market share in the short term by pricing their products significantly below current market levels which puts additional downward pressure on the prices we can obtain for our products 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in common with many other semiconductor products and as a response to competitive pressures  the asps of image sensor products have declined steadily since their introduction  and we expect asps to continue to decline in the future 
we recently introduced our new cameracube products 
depending on the adoption rate and unit volume  we believe these products may partially mitigate the rate of asp decline 
in order to maintain our gross margins  we and our suppliers must work continuously to lower our manufacturing costs and increase our production yields  and in order to maintain or grow our revenues  we need to increase the number of units we sell by a large enough amount to offset the effect of declining asps 
in addition  if we are unable to timely introduce new products that can take advantage of smaller process geometries or new products that incorporate more advanced technology and include more advanced features that can be sold at higher asps  our gross margin will decline 
as part of our ongoing efforts to achieve both higher resolutions and smaller chip sizes  we initiated mass production volumes of our omnipixel sensors with m process technologies in january more recently  in september  we introduced two devices based on our latest m omnibsi architecture 
given the rapidly changing nature of our technology  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter delays or other unexpected yield issues with future products 
during the early stages of production  production yields and gross margins for new products are typically lower than those of established products 
we can encounter unexpected manufacturing issues  such as unexpected back end yield problems 
in addition  in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products 
due to our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products 
given the current economic downturn  the visibility of our business outlook is extremely limited and forecasting is even more difficult than under normal market conditions 
as a result  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
we carefully consider the risk that our inventories may be excess to expected future demand and record appropriate reserves 
if  as sometimes happens  we are subsequently able to sell these reserved products  the sales have little or no associated cost and consequently they have a favorable impact on gross margins 
strategy our strategic goal is to produce the image sensors of choice for all available end use markets 
the most important elements of our strategy are the following maintain technology leadership 
we intend to maintain our position as a leader in cmos image sensor technology by continuing to develop our expertise in mixed signal implementation  advanced pixel design  feature integration  and manufacturing processes and controls  including automated testing 
our image sensor integrates both the image sensor and the signal processor into a single chip  often eliminating the requirement for a separate dsp 
as a result  our image sensors offer camera device manufacturers advantages in terms of size  power consumption  cost and ease of design 
for example  we have successfully increased the resolution of our image sensors while decreasing overall chip size by producing on m process geometries 
in february  we announced our omnipixel hs architecture  which incorporates a new pixel design that doubles the sensitivity of our m omnipixel architecture  which we introduced in may in may  we announced our omnibsi architecture  with an even smaller and more advanced m pixel 
we are continuing to develop products using still narrower geometries 
we have successfully developed image sensor technology from  pixels to nine megapixels  underscoring our ability to deliver a wide range of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued solutions to address changing market demands 
we are committed to continue increasing image quality and to reducing the overall size of the image sensor s array 
the omnibsi architecture behind our m pixel is based on an idea called back side illumination  or bsi 
all traditionally designed cmos image sensors capture light on the front side of the chip  so the photo sensitive portion has to share the surface of the sensor with the metal wiring of the transistors in the pixel 
with our new omnibsi architecture  the sensor receives light through the back side of the chip 
not only does this enable us to produce a superior image  it also permits the front of chip surface area to be devoted entirely to processing  and permits an increase in the number of metal layers  both of which result in greater functionality 
another advantage of capturing light on the back side of the image sensor is that we reduce the distance the light has to travel to the pixels  and thus provide a wider angle of light acceptance 
widening the angle of acceptance in turn makes it possible to reduce the height of the camera module  and thus the height of the device which incorporates the camera 
our recent introduction of wafer level optics to our product offerings is another example of our intention to continue to develop new and innovative technologies 
our cameracube technology is a three dimensional  reflowable  total camera solution that combines the full functionality of our image sensors with wafer level optics in one compact  small footprint package 
continue to develop our proprietary technology to maintain competitive advantage 
we intend to continue to develop proprietary intellectual property to maintain our competitive advantage 
we have developed a variety of proprietary technologies that expand the utility of our image sensor solutions 
for example  we have produced image sensors capable of generating useable data in both low light and bright light conditions simultaneously 
this high dynamic range  or hdr  technology enables the use of image sensors in demanding environments such as in automotive and security applications 
our commitment to enhancing our proprietary technology is also reflected in our acquisition of cdm and its wavefront coding technology and by the development of our omnibsi architecture described above 
leverage expertise across multiple mass market applications 
we intend to continue to focus on developing our image sensors for multiple mass market applications 
to date we have shipped close to one billion image sensors 
as the demand for camera functionality increases in our principal markets and becomes a standard feature in a wider variety of consumer  commercial and industrial applications  we expect that additional markets will emerge 
in the past  we have leveraged our expertise in certain end markets to expand into emerging mass market applications for our image sensors 
for example  we used the expertise we developed in mobile phone markets to develop image sensors for notebook computers 
other markets and applications we are focusing on include security and surveillance  toys and interactive video game consoles  and the multiple opportunities in automotive and medical applications 
increase our market presence 
we intend to increase our visibility and penetration into new product designs by collaborating with oems  vars and distributors and by entering into partnerships with other companies that offer complementary and supporting technologies 
in certain instances we will provide design services to our contract manufacturing partners  enabling them to increase their overall value added through the production of highly tailored end products  which we believe will increase the likelihood that they will recommend the use of our products to branded manufacturers 
in addition  we will team with companies that offer complementary and supporting technologies to integrate our products with theirs for use in the reference designs that they promote to manufacturers 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as a result  we believe that we are able to provide our customers with valuable design and marketing references 
further develop close customer relationships 
we intend to enhance our customer relationships by continuing to collaborate with our customers on the design and specification of their products 
we work with customers during various stages of their product development cycles  including strategic decision making  new product design and replacement design to help them develop a logical technology migration path and to ensure that our products meet their future design needs 
by working closely with our customers  we believe we can better anticipate their future design needs and increase the likelihood that they will incorporate our image sensors into their products 
our solution we specifically design our highly integrated image sensors to be cost effective and to provide high image quality 
by integrating a number of distinct functions onto a single cmos chip  including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of images for either digital or analog equipment  our image sensors offer camera device manufacturers a number of benefits  including high image quality and resolution 
we have developed a number of proprietary methods for enhancing image quality by increasing our image sensors sensitivity to light and significantly improving their signal to noise ratio 
these methods allow us to reduce the size of each individual pixel and thereby increase the number of pixels in a image sensor of a given size 
the result is a current portfolio of several high resolution image sensors ranging up to a megapixel product 
the first product using our proprietary omnibsi technology was an megapixel sensor 
in addition  we are able to produce image sensors at lower resolutions with smaller pixel arrays  which serve to reduce the overall cost of the image sensor and its supporting components  such as lenses 
lower cost 
the highly integrated design of our image sensor enables us to deliver image sensors to our customers at a cost which makes the cameras they are part of increasingly less expensive 
this cost saving is driven  in large part  by our ability to achieve a high level of functionality in a single chip while continually reducing the overall size of the device 
similarly  we believe our cameracube imaging devices  as compact total camera solutions that can be reflowed onto circuit boards directly  can streamline the camera device manufacturers process  yielding further cost savings to our customers 
accelerated time to market 
the highly integrated nature of our image sensor simplifies the design of cameras and allows our customers to shorten their product design cycles 
we believe our cameracube devices further shorten the design cycle by offering a complete imaging solution from the very beginning 
these factors provide our cell phone industry and consumer electronics customers with critical competitive advantages  as time to market is typically a major determinant of product success and longevity 
we also work closely with our customers to accelerate product development cycles by providing camera reference designs  engineering design review services and customer product evaluation  testing and debugging services 
in addition  we have designed our manufacturing and production processes to allow us to quickly ramp production volumes to meet increased customer demand  which is particularly important in the high volume markets in which we participate 
streamlined manufacturing and production 
our image sensors are well suited for production using the relatively simple  low cost and large scale wafer fabrication processes developed for other semiconductor products that use the cmos process 
we work closely with our foundry partners and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued with all the other providers of the manufacturing services we require to produce our final products to refine their processes in order to optimize image sensor performance and yields 
ease of use 
our single chip cmos design outputs video in industry standard formats directly from the chip 
these formats include the national television system committee  or ntsc  format and or the phase alternating line  or pal  format for analog video 
for digital video  our sensors output unprocessed data called rgb and or a standard signal color encoding system known as yuv 
as a result  our image sensors can be quickly and easily integrated into products targeted at numerous mass markets 
this is especially important in markets such as in mobile phones  notebook and webcams and pdas  where video imaging expertise has not been fully developed 
capital resources as of april   we held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments 
to mitigate market risk related to short term investments  we have an investment policy designed to preserve the value of capital and to generate interest income from these investments without material exposure to market fluctuations 
market risk is the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates or bond prices  and changes in market liquidity and in the pricing of risk 
our policy is to invest in financial instruments with short maturities  limiting interest rate exposure  and to measure performance against comparable benchmarks 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better and money market funds 
we do not believe that the value of our cash and short term investments will be significantly affected by recent instability in the global financial markets 
in june  our board of directors authorized us to use up to million of our available cash under an open market program to repurchase our common stock 
at the expiration of the program in june  we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in february  our board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
subject to applicable securities laws  such repurchases will be at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate  based on factors such as market conditions  legal requirements and other corporate considerations 
as of april   we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock under this open market program for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
see note treasury stock to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenues we generate almost all our revenue by selling our products directly to oems and vars and indirectly through distributors 
for accounting purposes  we treat sales to oems and vars as one source of revenue  and sales to distributors as another and our revenue recognition policies for the two groups are different 
in general  we sell to our customers on fob shipping point or fca terms 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below for additional information regarding recognition of revenue 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our estimates reflect the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition for shipments to customers without agreements that allow for returns or credits  principally oems and vars  we recognize revenue using the sell in method 
under this method  we recognize revenue when title passes to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  collection of resulting receivables is considered reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining material obligations 
we provide for future returns of potentially defective products based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
for cash consideration given to customers for which we do not receive a separately identifiable benefit or cannot reasonably estimate fair value  we record the amounts as reductions of revenue 
for shipment of products sold to distributors under agreements allowing for returns or credits  title and the risk of ownership to the products transfer to the distributor upon shipment  and the distributor is obligated to pay for the products whether or not the distributor has sold them at the time payment is due 
under the terms of our agreements with such distributors and subject to our prior approval  distributors are entitled to reclaim from us as price adjustments the difference  if any  between the prices at which we sold the product to the distributors and the prices at which the product is subsequently sold by the distributor 
in addition  distributors have limited rights to return inventory that they determine is in excess of their requirements  and accordingly  in determining the appropriate level of provision for excess and obsolete inventory  we take into account the inventories held by our distributors 
for these reasons  prices and revenues are not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to our end user customers and the distributor notifies us in writing of the details of such sales transactions 
accordingly  we recognize revenue using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  we defer the revenue  adjustments to revenue and the related costs of revenue until the final resale of such products to end customers 
the amounts billed to these distributors and adjustments to revenue and the cost of inventory shipped to  but not yet sold by  the distributors are shown net on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenues  less cost of revenues 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured or upon receipt of payment 
in addition  we recognize revenue from the performance of services to a limited number of our customers by our wholly owned subsidiary  cdm 
we recognize the cdm associated revenue under either the completed contract or the percentage of completion methods 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is used for cost reimbursement type contracts  where revenues recognized are that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs based on current estimates of the costs to complete the projects 
cdm associated revenue has not been material in any of the periods presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we undertake credit evaluations for all major sale transactions before we release product for shipment 
normal payment terms apply upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide allowances for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and may require additional allowances  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately and  respectively  of total accounts receivable 
allowance for sales returns and warranties based on historical sales returns and other known factors  we provide for estimated sales returns in the same period we record the related revenues 
to estimate our allowance for sales returns  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the allowance are recorded as a reduction to net revenues 
because the allowance for sales returns is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our allowances may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our allowances are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
we warrant to our customers that our products will work in accordance with each product s specifications 
due to the cost and other complexities associated with rectifying any product defects  we do not repair any defective products 
if a product is defective  the customer notifies us and  with our approval  returns the defective product 
we then send replacement products to the customer 
accordingly  we account for any exposure related to defective products as a portion of our allowance for sales returns 
the net change in our allowance for sales returns balance in fiscal was approximately of revenues  and the allowance was approximately of total accounts receivable at april  excess and obsolete inventory and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our forecast of future demand for our products 
we record provisions for the cost of inventories when the number of units on hand exceeds the number of units that we forecast will be sold over a certain period of time  generally months 
when we recognize the provisions  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued newly established cost basis 
because of risk of obsolescence  we will generally provide for the costs of our inventories in excess of our forecast for the applicable period 
from time to time  we have sold certain previously written down products 
even though we have sold some products at a price that was less than our original cost  sales of these products improve our gross margins because the inventory was previously written down 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding three months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will record a provision  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products  while preparing for production of newer products 
given our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products or the projected life cycles of new products which have continued to shorten in duration 
under these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages of certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
stock based compensation expense effective may   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payment awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including our stock price  expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
for expected volatility  we use an average between the historical volatility of our common stock  and the implied volatility of traded options on our common stock 
the expected term of the awards is based on historical data regarding our employees option exercise behaviors 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
in addition to the requirement for fair value estimates  sfas no 
r also requires the recording of expense that is net of an anticipated forfeiture rate 
only expenses associated with awards that are ultimately expected to vest are included in our financial statements 
our forfeiture rate is determined based on our historical option cancellation experience 
we evaluate the black scholes assumptions that we use to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
with respect to the forfeiture rate  we will revise the rate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense related to future stock based payments may differ significantly from estimates recorded in prior periods 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  or fsp r fsp r provides an alternative transition method of accounting for the tax effects of adopting sfas no 
r 
we have elected to use the long form method to establish the beginning balance of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we also chose to derecognize both the gross deferred tax assets and the offsetting valuation allowance pertaining to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that represent excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
we have also elected to use the with and without approach as described in emerging issues task force  or eitf  topic no 
d in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized 
as a result  we will recognize a tax benefit from stock based awards in additional paid in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock based awards on other tax attributes  such as research and development tax credits  through the consolidated statements of operations 
in september  our stockholders approved the equity incentive plan  or the plan 
see note employee stock purchase  equity incentive and stock option plans to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  as allowed by the plan  we granted performance share awards to certain employees 
the number of shares that an employee actually earns under the awards is based on omnivision s achievement of certain corporate performance goals at the end of a one year performance period 
the number of earned performance shares that an employee is eligible to receive may be reduced depending on such employee s individual performance 
as required by sfas no 
r  when we record the stock based compensation expense for such awards that carry performance contingencies  we have to estimate the probable outcome at the end of the performance period 
furthermore  we have to adjust the cumulative compensation expense recorded when probable outcome for the performance based shares is subsequently updated for changes in facts and circumstances 
valuation of long lived assets although to date we have not recognized any impairment losses  we assess annually whether the value of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  prepaid wafer credits and long term investments has been impaired 
we perform a similar assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
if such events occur  we would estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would recognize an impairment loss 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued valuation of financial instruments beginning in the first fiscal quarter of  we assessed the fair value of our financial instruments based on the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
sfas no 
specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect observable or unobservable inputs 
we use inputs such as quotes prices in active markets  broker dealer quotes and other similar data from independent sources to determine the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 
for quoted prices from active markets  we do not make any material adjustments 
for quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other observable and market corroborated inputs  we review the inputs for reasonableness  and may further adjust the fair value based on market indices or other information that management deems material to the fair value estimates 
as of april   the fair value of our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included million of assets  and million of liabilities 
of the million of assets  million were classified as level  most of which were investments in money market funds 
the remaining million of investments were classified as level  representing investments in certificates of deposit  debt securities issued by us government agencies  and other corporate securities 
the million of liabilities were classified as level  and consisted of interest rate swaps that we obtained when we entered into a mortgage loan in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 the fair value of the interest rate swaps included the effect of our credit risk 
we did not classify any financial instruments as level under the sfas no 
hierarchy 
accounting for income taxes in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  and related guidance  we are required to make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may increase or decrease our tax provision in a subsequent period 
similarly  for tax liabilities denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  changes in the value of the denominated currency will increase or decrease our tax provision in a subsequent period 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
in accordance with fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
in the first step  recognition  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criterion 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
because we are required to determine the probability of various possible outcomes  such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this re evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  and changes in tax law 
a change in recognition or measurement would result either in the recognition of a tax benefit or in an additional charge to the tax provision for the period 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we also have to assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if realization is not likely  we are required to increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate we will not ultimately realize 
we believe that we will ultimately realize a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of april   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million to offset california research and development tax credit carryovers 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these carryovers 
in the future  if the credit is utilized and the valuation allowance is released  the release of valuation allowance will be accounted for as a reduction of the income tax expense in the period such event occurs 
for fiscal  and  our income tax provision reflected effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
these rates are less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately principally because we earn a portion of our profits in jurisdictions where tax rates are lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringed technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
given the uncertainties associated with litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

revenues decreased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in unit sales of our image sensor products across all product categories and a decline in our asps 
revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors we sell our image sensor products either directly to oems and vars or indirectly through distributors 
the percentage of revenues from sales to oems and vars was lower in fiscal than in fiscal  but higher in fiscal than in fiscal we expect that the percentage of revenues from sales through oems and vars will vary from year to year in response to changes in the make up of our customer list  and that it may continue to represent a majority of our revenues 
the gross margin that we earn on sales to oems and vars or through distributors is not significantly different

revenues from domestic sales as compared to foreign sales the following table shows the percentage of our revenues derived from sales of our image sensor products to domestic customers as compared to foreign customers in each of fiscal  and year ended april  domestic sales foreign sales total we derive the majority of our foreign sales from customers in asia and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
historically  our sales to asia pacific customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a result of the continuing trend of outsourcing the production of consumer electronics products to asia pacific manufacturers and facilities 
recently  we have experienced an increase in domestic sales as a percentage of total revenues 
however  due to the fact that virtually all products incorporating our image sensor products are sold globally  we believe that the geographic distribution of our sales does not accurately reflect the geographic distribution of sales into end user markets of products which incorporate our image sensors 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit comparison of fiscal and fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was of revenues  down from the we reported for fiscal the principal contributor to the year over year decrease in gross margin was the decline in our asps 
this contributor to the reduction in gross profit was partially offset by a more favorable product mix and reductions in our production costs 
during fiscal  the asps of our products were lower than they were in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in asps was due  in part  to a general price decline due to competition and  in part  also to an increase in the proportion of sales represented by bare die  often referred to as chip on board  or cob  products  rather than packaged products 
we recorded approximately million in stock based compensation expense to cost of revenues in fiscal in accordance with sfas no

comparison of fiscal and fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was of revenues  down from the we reported for fiscal we made a concerted effort to improve our gross margin during the year  and succeeded in increasing our gross margin from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
the principal causes of the year over year decline in our gross margin were the increases in the provisions we made for excess and obsolete inventory  changes in our product sales mix  and the decline in our average selling prices 
in fiscal  we recorded provisions of million to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in average selling prices was due in part to an increase in the proportion of our sales represented by vga image sensors  and in part also to an increase in the proportion of sales represented by bare die rather than packaged products 
our gross margin was also lower in part as a result of the fact that revenue from sales of previously written down products in fiscal was million  as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
we recorded approximately million in stock based compensation expense to cost of revenues in fiscal in accordance with sfas no

r 
the increase in non recurring engineering expenses is primarily due to an increase in the number of new designs we released to our foundry partners 
we anticipate that our research  development and related expenses may decrease slightly as we continue to implement additional cost reduction measures 
this may be partially offset by expenses we anticipate incurring as we develop and introduce new products  including those employing our cameracube and omnibsi technologies and as we develop other new technologies related to image sensors

goodwill impairment during the second quarter of fiscal  based on a combination of factors  including the significant decline in our market capitalization and the global economic downturn  we concluded that there were sufficient factual circumstances for interim impairment analyses under sfas no

the million decline in interest income  net  resulted from an million reduction in interest income for fiscal as compared to the prior year was the result of lower interest rates on interest bearing accounts and a million increase in interest expense associated with long term borrowings 
the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the recognition of interest charges as expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal during which period such charges were capitalized

the principal components of this item were approximately million representing our portion of the income recorded by wlcsp  which we account for under the equity method of accounting  a million non cash charge arising from the revaluation of the interest rate swap that is an economic hedge of the mortgage on our santa clara property  and a  loss that represented our portion of the net loss recorded by impac  which we account for under the equity method of accounting 
provision for income taxes we generated approximately million in loss before income taxes and minority interest for fiscal and million and million in income before income taxes and minority interest for fiscal and  respectively 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately  for fiscal and a provision for income taxes for fiscal and of approximately million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  and  our effective tax rates were  and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because we earn a substantial portion of our income in jurisdictions where tax rates are lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal will continue to be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
the extent of the difference is principally contingent upon the amount of non deductible stock based compensation expenses and the proportion and geographic mix of our total pre tax income 
during fiscal  the emergency economic stabilization act of reinstated the us federal research and development tax credit  retroactive to january  as a result  our benefit for income taxes for fiscal reflected a million tax benefit related to fiscal research and development expenses 
our benefit from income taxes for fiscal also reflected the unfavorable impact of the million goodwill impairment charge  partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange gains related to our unrecognized tax benefits and the benefit from the fiscal us federal research and development tax credit

these decreases in working capital were partially offset by a million increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily due to cash provided by operating activities  a million decrease in accounts payable resulting from the timing of inventory purchasing cycles  a million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  a million decrease in income taxes payable  and a  increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
in march  we purchased the santa clara property 
in connection with the purchase  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a domestic bank on march  the loan and security agreement provides for a term mortgage loan in the principal amount of million  or the mortgage loan  and a secured line of credit with an aggregate maximum principal amount of up to million  or the term loan

borrowings under the term loan accrue interest at the libor rate plus basis points 
the mortgage and term loans mature on march  and september   respectively 
in order to secure the obligations  we also entered into a deed of trust  assignment of rents and leases  security agreement and fixture for the benefit of the domestic bank and a stock pledge agreement between us and the domestic bank 
the loan and security agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants including  but not limited to  meeting certain minimum financial standards  as well as certain negative covenants limiting our ability to take certain actions without the prior written consent of the domestic bank including  but not limited to  selling or leasing the santa clara property or merging or consolidating with another entity 
in addition  the loan and security agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events of default our obligations under the loan and security agreement may become immediately due and payable  or the domestic bank may cease making additional advances under the term loan or otherwise extending credit to us under the loan and security agreement 
as of april   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the loan and security agreement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sell our products globally  in particular to branded customers  contract manufacturers  vars and distributors in china  japan  korea and taiwan 
the great majority of our transactions with our customers and vendors are denominated in us dollars 
the expenses we incur in currencies other than us dollars affect gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses  research  development and related expenses and income taxes  and are primarily incurred in china  where the chinese yuan  or cny  is the local currency and in taiwan  where the new taiwan dollar is the local currency 
as of april   the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiaries located in hong kong  omnivision technologies hong kong company limited  omnivision trading hong kong company ltd  and omnivision holding hong kong co  ltd  in the cayman islands  omnivision international holding  ltd 
and omnivision technology international ltd 
formerly huawei technology international  ltd  in china  osc and otc and ost  and in taiwan  taiwan omnivision technologies co  ltd  taiwan omnivision international technologies co  ltd  and taiwan omnivision investment holding co  ltd  is the us dollar 
our other wholly owned subsidiaries have their respective local currencies as their functional currencies 
the functional currency of our consolidated affiliate  soi  is the new taiwan dollar 
transaction gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies are included in other expense  net for the periods presented 
the amounts of transaction gains and losses for fiscal and were not material 
given that the expenses that we incur in currencies other than us dollars have not been a significant percentage of our revenues  we do not believe that our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk is significant 
consequently  we do not believe that a ten percent change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on our future net income or cash flows 
because we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk  we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or used any other derivative financial instruments 
although we transact the overwhelming majority of our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products and thus may impact our results of operations 
market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  from time to time  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit issued by banks  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase 
in the past  we also invested in auction rate securities and in variable rate demand notes  which have a final maturity date of up to years but whose interest rate is reset at varying intervals typically between seven and days 
as of april   we did not hold any auction rate securities or variable rate demand notes 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
we do not believe that the recent instability in global financial markets has significantly affected the value of our cash and short term investments 
during fiscal  we financed the purchase of the santa clara property with a million mortgage loan 
the mortgage loan is a variable rate loan which bears interest at libor plus basis points and changes in the interest rate affect our interest payments 
however  concurrent with the mortgage loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount that approximates the principal outstanding under the mortgage loan 
we are the fixed rate payer under the swap with a fixed rate of 
by july  we drew down million under a related term loan 
concurrent with the term loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount that approximates the principal outstanding under the term loan 
we are the fixed rate payer under the swap with a fixed rate of 
consequently  although we are required to mark the value of the swaps to market at each balance sheet date and record the associated non cash cost or benefit as part of other expense  net  a hypothetical ten percent change in libor would not have a material effect on our annual interest expense
