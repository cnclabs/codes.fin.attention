item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our primary businesses are in the defense and transportation industries 
for the year ended september   of sales were derived from defense systems and services  while were derived from transportation fare collection systems and other commercial operations 
these are high technology businesses that design  manufacture and integrate complex systems to meet the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and other nations around the world 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately of sales in compared to in and at september   we reevaluated our segment reporting in light of changes to our management structure  internal performance reporting and incentive compensation plans that became effective in previously our defense business had been reported as a single segment  with a single executive responsible for the entire business  operating performance measured as a single unit and management incentive plans that were based on total defense segment performance 
with the changes during the current fiscal year  we are now reporting results for two defense segments  defense systems and mission support services 
the transportation systems segment is still considered one reporting segment 
we have reclassified prior period amounts to reflect this organizational change 
mission support services mss operates constructive military training systems  provides live training mission support  distributed interactive simulation  development of military training doctrine  force modernization services for nato entrants and field operations and maintenance 
cubic defense systems cds is focused on two primary lines of business training systems and communications 
the segment is a diversified supplier of live and virtual military training systems  and communication systems and products to the us department of defense  other government agencies and allied nations 
we design instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training  weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  and search and rescue markets 
cubic transportation systems cts develops and delivers innovative fare collection systems for public transit authorities worldwide 
we provide hardware  software and multiagency  multimodal transportation integration technologies and a full scope of operational services that allow the agencies to efficiently collect fares  manage their operations  reduce shrinkage and make using public transit a more convenient and attractive option for commuters 
consolidated overview sales in fiscal increased from due to growth in all three segments 
about of the growth was from our previously existing businesses  with the remainder due to acquisitions we made in and in sales exceeded billion for the first time in our history  totaling billion  compared to million in in  sales were down slightly from because of the sale of our corrugated box business in the fourth quarter of and because of a transition in some of our defense systems contracts from the development phase to the production phase 
this is described more fully in the segment discussion following 
as a result of the growth in sales and improved operating performance from cds  our operating income increased in fiscal to million from million in last year s results had included a restructuring charge of million and an operating loss of million in the communications business within cds 
we made two small transportation systems acquisitions in which resulted in a slight decrement to operating income this year  as the amortization of purchased intangibles exceeded the operating income from the acquired businesses 
we believe this is a short term situation  as the amortization charges are highest in the first year and profitability of the acquired contracts is expected to improve in future years 
operating income decreased in fiscal from million in operating income from cts increased significantly in  more than doubling from the level 
however  cds incurred an operating loss in more than offsetting the improvement from cts 
in addition  we incurred the restructuring charge in  as mentioned above 
see the segment discussions following for further details of segment operating results 
net income increased to million per share from million per share in and million per share in higher net income resulted primarily from the improvement in operating income  as described above 
this was partially offset by lower investment income due to lower interest rates and a provision for settlement of a lawsuit of million that reduced net income in the fourth quarter by approximately million  after applicable income taxes  or per share 
net income in was lower than in primarily because of the operating loss in cds 
the restructuring costs mentioned above also reduced net income in by approximately million after applicable income taxes  or per share 
also included in was a gain of million in the fourth quarter on the sale of our investment in a defense related joint venture that added approximately million to net income  after applicable income taxes  or per share 
in we sold our corrugated box business  also in the fourth quarter  for a gain of approximately million  after applicable income taxes  or per share 
reductions in tax contingency reserves accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the  and net income 
the gross margin from product sales improved in to from in and in improved performance from cds accounted for the improvement in in  better performance from cts systems contracts contributed to the gross margin improvement over  partially offset by a lower margin from cds due to the operating loss in the communications business 
the gross margin from service sales was in compared to in and in gross margins in the mss business were lower in primarily because of a competitively bid follow on contract that generated lower margins than the previous contract had in and higher sales and margins from cts service contracts in europe contributed to the improvement in over selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million or of sales in compared to million  or of sales  in  and million  or of sales  in sg a increased in due to a bad debt write off of million incurred at cds and from the businesses acquired in and in  sg a increased at cds due to increased bid and proposal expenditures 
amortization expense increased to million or of sales compared to million  or of sales  in  and million  or of sales  in the increase in was due primarily to the acquisition of omega in the th quarter of  as well as from the transportation systems acquisitions made in company sponsored research and development r d spending was million in compared to million in and million in r d projects for the development of data link technologies begun in were completed  resulting in lower spending in  however  this was partially offset by increased spending for transportation and security related projects 
our r d spending continues to be incurred primarily in connection with customer funded activities 
we do not rely heavily on company sponsored r d  as most of our new product development occurs in conjunction with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required development activity in was million  compared to million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales  rather than r d  as they are directly related to contract performance 
interest and dividend income decreased significantly in to million compared to million in and million in  despite higher available cash balances  due to lower interest rates 
other income expense netted to income of million in compared to an expense of million in and income of million in in and we realized foreign currency exchange gains on advances to our foreign subsidiaries  compared to a loss in interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in and million in due to a reduction in long term borrowings over the three year period 
our effective tax rate for was of pretax income compared to in and in the effective rate decreased in primarily because of a higher research and experimentation r e credit realized this year due partially to an increase in qualifying activity 
the credit for also included million from fiscal that was not realized until because the credit had expired and was not reinstated by the us congress until october higher income in the us added to our effective tax rate in due to higher state income taxes  however  this was partially offset by a lower provision for taxes from foreign earnings repatriation 
the effective rates in  and benefited from the reversal of tax contingency provisions amounting to a net million  million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits  and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
mission support services segment years ended september  in millions mission support services sales mission support services operating income mss sales increased in compared to an increase in over about half of the sales increase in both years came from omega  the company we acquired at the end of july the sales improvement in also came from an increase in activity at the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  la and at the us army quartermaster school 
in  lower sales from the jrtc were more than offset by higher sales from the quartermaster school contract which was new that year and from our contract with the us marine corps that was expanded as a result of the contract renewal in operating income from mss increased less than in  after increasing in the new company  omega  contributed over million to operating income in the first two months we owned it in  however  the contract that generated much of that profit was scaled back significantly in  resulting in lower operating income this year 
overall  omega was only slightly profitable for the year  after covering acquisition related costs of million and amortization of intangible assets of million 
higher sales from the jrtc contract in helped to increase operating profits  in addition to better performance from certain operations and maintenance contracts 
however  we realized lower operating income from the us marine corp 
contract  as it was competitively bid at a lower profit margin than we had experienced from the previous marine corp 
contract 
we did  however  receive a contract modification in related to the completed marine corp 
contract that reimbursed us for out of scope costs expensed in  adding million to operating income in we also provided a reserve of million in for settlement of a wage related lawsuit on one of our contracts in california 
in  higher sales from the us marine corps contract contributed to operating income growth 
however  these increases were nearly offset by lower sales and profit margins from the jrtc contract and from other mss contracts that had experienced particularly strong performance in defense systems segment years ended september  in millions defense systems sales training systems communications tactical systems and other defense systems operating income training systems communications tactical systems and other training systems training systems sales increased in after decreasing in sales of small arms virtual training systems and air combat training systems increased in  while ground combat training systems sales decreased 
sales were higher from the air combat training system contract known as p and from air combat training sales to the far east 
sales were lower in from ground combat training systems in the uk and canada 
the decrease in sales came from each of the major product lines  including air combat training  ground combat training and small arms virtual training systems 
sales were lower in by million from the p contract and from an air combat training system in australia that was completed in the first quarter 
partially offsetting these sales decreases was an increase in sales from the new joint strike fighter jsf development contract and other air combat training contracts 
sales in three major training systems product lines were impacted in by a transition from the development phase  where revenue is recognized on a cost to cost percentage completion basis  to the production phase  where we recognize revenues from production orders on a units of delivery percentage completion basis  resulting in the recording of sales when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer 
this includes the p air combat training contract  electro optics contracts and small arms training systems 
this transition also resulted in an increase in inventories of million from these product lines in fiscal  partially offset by customer advances of million 
training systems operating income increased from million in to million this year 
higher sales of air combat training systems and small arms virtual training systems and higher profit margins on air combat training systems in the far east contributed to the improvement 
in addition  last year s results included cost growth for the development of an electro optic training system  which totaled million compared to million this year 
product shipments on this contract also contributed to the improved results for the year  adding million to operating income in partially offsetting these profit improvements was a million allowance for doubtful accounts established during the second fiscal quarter this year 
a company through which we sold training systems products to the us government in previous periods failed to pass on to us cash they collected from the government on our behalf 
we were able to collect a portion of the money they owed us and have negotiated a payment plan with them  however  the company appears to be in financial trouble and collection of the remainder continues to be doubtful 
we will reverse the reserve only upon the collection of cash from them 
training systems operating income decreased in compared to lower sales from the p and australian air combat training contracts and small arms virtual training systems contributed to the decrease in operating income 
however  the primary cause of the decrease was cost growth of million on the electro optics contract mentioned above 
this cost growth stemmed from problems encountered in the second quarter during system integration testing  resulting in increased engineering development costs for design changes and higher manufacturing and rework costs 
we also experienced further cost growth of million in on a contract for the development of a ground combat training system in the middle east 
this compares to cost growth of million in on the same contract 
improved profit margins in from a ground combat training system in canada partially offset the loss from this middle east contract 
communications communications sales improved to million this year compared to million last year  a increase 
a settlement agreement reached in the first quarter with the us navy on a data link development contract added million to sales and facilitated progress toward completion of the contract  further increasing sales for the year 
sales were also higher from a contract to develop a data link for unmanned aerial vehicles for a uk customer 
lower sales of power amplifiers partially offset the growth in data link sales for the year 
sales from communications decreased in  as lower sales were realized from contracts for the development of data links for unmanned aerial vehicles in the us and us and from a contract for the development of a data link for the us navy 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of personnel locator systems and power amplifiers 
communications operating income improved in to million from an operating loss of million last year 
cost growth on three data link development contracts had resulted in last year s operating loss 
this year two of the three contracts generated operating income due to contract restructurings and change orders received 
lower sales of power amplifiers in resulted in lower operating income  partially offsetting the improvements in profitability from the data link contracts 
the primary cause of the million operating loss in communications in was cost growth of million from a contract to develop new data link technology for unmanned aerial vehicles for a uk customer 
as mentioned above  the contract was restructured in early cost growth on two other data link development contracts impacted profitability by million in one of these is the us navy contract mentioned above for which we reached a settlement agreement with the customer in early in addition  we incurred costs on several research and development projects for new data link technology during  which added million to the operating loss for the year 
partially offsetting these increased costs was higher operating income on higher sales of power amplifiers and personnel locator systems 
transportation systems segment years ended september  in millions transportation systems sales transportation systems operating income cts sales increased  from million in to million in sales increased in north america from a fare collection development contract awarded last year  from the sale of spare parts and from contracts we added in a small service business acquisition made in july in the uk  higher sales came primarily from contracts with transport for london and uk train operating companies  however  a lower average exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar in resulted in a decrease in the dollar value of uk sales of million compared to the rate in effect in cts sales increased in primarily due to additional work from change orders on the prestige contract and from other contracts in the uk sales were also higher from system installation work on a contract in australia and increased sales of spare parts in north america 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales from system installation contracts in north america and sweden 
the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar had no impact on sales for  when compared to  as the average rate for the year was virtually the same as in cts operating income improved from million in to million in  a increase 
higher sales of spare parts added to operating income and contract restructuring agreements reached during the first quarter added a net million to operating income 
as a result of one of the contract restructurings  we wrote off accounts receivable of million against the associated allowance for doubtful accounts  resulting in no impact on operating income 
in addition  the successful completion of a new fare collection system in north america resulted in an additional contribution to operating income for the year 
although operating income in the uk was higher in than in as a result of higher sales  the lower british pound vs 
us dollar exchange rate negatively impacted operating income by million in operating income for cts more than doubled in when compared to higher sales and improved performance from uk contracts  including bonuses earned on the prestige contract for system usage  and profits from increased spares sales in the us contributed to the increase in cost growth on north american contracts was limited to million in  a significant improvement over when cost growth on the same contracts had been million 
partially offsetting the profit improvements in was cost growth of million on a contract in sweden and an investment in new technology of million we made related to a new contract in north america 
a reduction in legal fees of million in also contributed to the operating income improvement 
as mentioned above relating to sales  currency exchange between the british pound and us dollar had no impact on operating income when compared to backlog september  in millions total backlog transportation systems mission support services defense systems training systems communications other total defense systems total funded backlog transportation systems mission support services defense systems training systems communications other total defense systems total in addition to the amounts identified above  we have been selected as a participant in or  in some cases  the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received 
in august  transport for london tfl notified our owned subsidiary  transys  that they will be terminating the prestige fare collection system contract as of august in accordance with the early termination provision of the contract 
as a result of this early termination  million million was removed from transportation systems backlog as of september  however  in november  tfl awarded cubic directly a new three year contract that includes virtually all of the services currently being performed by transys through its shareholders 
the term of this contract is for the time period from august to august  with a base value of approximately million million  which was added to the september  backlog 
the contract value will be indexed for inflation from august through its completion and additionally includes variable payments that are contingent upon system usage  similar to provisions that were contained in the prestige contract 
a decrease in the value of the british pound vs 
the us dollar between september  and september   resulted in a decrease in transportation systems backlog of approximately million 
the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised 
new accounting standards on july  the financial accounting standards board officially launched the accounting standards codification fasb asc  as the authoritative source of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the asc is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the sec issued guidance regarding the impact of the fasb asc on certain sec rules  regulations  and interpretive releases and staff accounting bulletins 
the sec advised that references to fasb standards in current sec text should correspond to the rules in the fasb asc 
the fasb asc does not supersede any sec rules or regulations 
the fasb asc should not be considered the authoritative source for sec guidance 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standard that defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted this standard in the quarter ending december  with no material impact to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued an accounting standard that permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we adopted this standard in the quarter ending december  with no material impact to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december the fasb issued an accounting standard that applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses 
this standard applies to all business entities  including mutual entities that previously used the pooling of interests method of accounting for some business combinations 
we will adopt this standard in the fiscal year beginning october  the impact of this standard will depend on the size and structure of future acquisitions 
in march the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risks and accounting designation 
we adopted this standard in the quarter ended march  with no material impact to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
during the quarter ended june   we adopted a standard that establishes general accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which for us will be the fiscal year beginning october  we currently do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a standard which expands the disclosure requirements about plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december   which for us will be the fiscal year beginning october  we currently do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued a standard which changes the approach in determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  and modifies the methods allowed for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
in addition  this standard requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
this standard is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november   which for us will be the fiscal year beginning october  in october  the fasb issued revised accounting guidance  which can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
this guidance modifies the objective and reliable evidence of fair value criterion from the separation criteria used to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurement required under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance  provides a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling price  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
we are currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this update will have  if any  on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
this revised guidance is effective for new or materially modified arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after june   and we expect to adopt it in the fiscal year beginning october   although early adoption is allowed 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to million in  and million in in addition to cash generated by earnings  a decrease in accounts receivable in each of the three years amounting to million  million and million in  and  respectively  contributed to the positive cash flows 
in addition  net customer advances of million  million and million in  and  respectively  added to the positive result 
growth in inventories partially offset these improvements in each of the three years  using cash of million  million and million  respectively  reflecting the transition from development type contracts to production contracts described in the defense systems section above and a temporary build up of inventories at cts related to one contract in positive operating cash flows in and came from all three segments  with cds providing more than half of the operating cash flows in in the greater portion came from cts 
all of the operating cash flows in came from cts  while cds and mss cash flows were slightly negative for the year 
we have classified certain unbilled accounts receivable balances as noncurrent because we do not expect to receive payment within one year from the balance sheet date 
at september   this balance was million compared to million at september  cash flows used in investing activities in included two small transportation systems acquisitions made during the year and the final payment of million from our acquisition of omega training group  inc we also made normal capital expenditures of million and purchased marketable securities totaling million in in our acquisition of omega used cash of million  net of cash acquired 
we made capital expenditures of million in  partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of our interest in a joint venture 
we also liquidated million of short term investments in early  thereby avoiding much of the turmoil in the credit markets that occurred later in the year 
during we had invested a net of million in these financial instruments  received million from the sale of our former corrugated box business and made million in capital expenditures 
financing activities in included scheduled payments on long term borrowings of million and the payment of a dividend to shareholders of million cents per share 
similarly  in financing activities included payments on long term borrowings of million and the payment of a dividend to shareholders of million cents per share 
financing activities in included the repayment of short term borrowings of million and scheduled payments on long term borrowings of million  in addition to the payment of a dividend to shareholders of million cents per share 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased million in primarily because of an increase in the recorded liability for our pension plans which reduced the balance by million after applicable income taxes 
in addition  foreign currency translation adjustments also reduced the balance by million 
these adjustments  less a small unrealized gain from cash flow hedges  resulted in a negative balance in accumulated other comprehensive income of million at september  compared to a positive balance of million at september  the pension plan unfunded balance increased from the september  balance of million to million at september  this decrease in the funded position can be attributed primarily to a decrease in the discount rate we used to calculate the pension liability 
the net deferred tax asset increased to million at september  compared to million at september  the reason for the increase is that the effect of recording adjustments to the pension liability through other comprehensive income resulted in a deferred tax asset of million at september  compared to million at september  we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
we own of the common stock of transaction systems limited transys  a special purpose company formed in the united kingdom to bid on the prestige fare collection system contract  which outsourced most of the functions of the transport for london tfl fare collection system 
in august  tfl notified transys that they will be terminating the prestige contract as of august in accordance with the early termination provision of the contract 
as a result of this termination for convenience  upon completion of the contract in  the operations of transys will cease 
the contract termination notice triggered a requirement for transys to engage an independent engineer to produce a report on the state of the assets associated with the prestige system 
the engineer is scheduled to deliver their report in december  stating whether  in their opinion  the fare collection system assets are able to pass a performance test for a period of two years beyond the contract termination 
the performance test requires the assets to perform at contractual minimum levels with broadly the same level of maintenance as that performed under the contract 
if the engineer determines that the assets may fail the performance test then transys and its subcontractors have until august to carry out the necessary remediation of the assets 
at the date of the termination of the contract in august  the same engineer will deliver a supplementary report which is a follow up assessment to take into account the remediation efforts of transys and its subcontractors  and to give an opinion on the remaining level of remediation work required in order to allow the system to pass the performance test for the two year period 
the contract allows tfl to withhold an amount up to approximately million million from its final payment to transys pending the delivery of the supplementary report and the completion of any remediation work identified in the report 
this process is not expected to take longer than six months and tfl would be required to pay interest on any funds withheld 
transys is required to repay the banks in august and  to the extent that there is a funding shortfall in transys because of a withhold by tfl  the shareholders are each required to provide transys their share of the cash required to fully repay the debt until the funds are returned to transys by tfl  at which time the shareholders would be repaid by transys 
we estimate that our share of this withhold could be as much as million 
in addition  although we consider the possibility remote  if the other shareholders of transys fail to provide their share of the funding  we could be forced to provide the entire funding amount to transys for up to six months 
while there is the possibility that tfl will withhold some amount from transys upon contract termination  we do not believe this will be necessary 
in recent years the fare collection system has consistently exceeded the contractual performance levels and we believe that sufficient costs have been included in our estimated costs to complete the contract to continue this level of performance for the required period 
in addition  since we have been selected as the successor contractor to the prestige contract  we believe tfl will have no reason to withhold funds to assure any required remediation will be completed 
however  there remains the possibility that we will be required to provide some amount of funding to transys for up to months following the end of the contract in august our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the short term borrowing arrangement we have in new zealand  we have a committed five year credit facility from a group of financial institutions in the us  aggregating million 
this agreement will expire in march and we are currently in negotiations for a new three year agreement for the same amount 
we expect the annual fees under the new arrangement to increase by several hundred thousand dollars per year 
as of september   million of this capacity was used for letters of credit  leaving an additional million available 
our total debt to capital ratio at september  was less than 
in addition  our cash and short term investments totaled million at september  which exceeded our total long term debt by million 
our cash is invested primarily in highly liquid government treasury instruments in the u 
s 
and europe 
the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  valuation of goodwill  purchased intangibles and pension liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical  we make many other accounting estimates in pre paring our financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical 
this discussion of critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments should be read in conjunction with other disclosures included in this discussion  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  contingencies and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed each of the critical accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record revenue for long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
most of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver minimal quantities over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
for certain other long term  fixed price production contracts not requiring substantial development effort we use the units of delivery percentage completion method as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in the contract value only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
provisions are made on a current basis to fully recognize any anticipated losses on contracts 
we record sales under cost reimbursement type contracts as we incur the costs 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profits  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
sales of products are recorded when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
sales for fixed price service contracts that do not contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned  or obligations fulfilled  in a different manner 
sales for fixed price service contracts that contain measurable units of work performed are recognized when the units of work are completed 
sales and profits on contracts that specify multiple deliverables are allocated to separate units of accounting when there is objective evidence of fair value and that each accounting unit has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe it is more likely than not a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  if examined  would be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the us for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  annually we evaluate the capital requirements in our foreign subsidiaries and determine the amount of excess capital  if any  that is available for distribution 
whether or not we actually repatriate the excess capital in the form of a dividend  we would provide for us taxes on the amount determined to be available for distribution 
this evaluation is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of us taxes provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is affected by these judgments 
based on this analysis in  we determined that million british pounds million  net of hedge losses was excess capital in the uk and that million new zealand dollars million  net of hedge losses was excess capital in new zealand and paid dividends in these amounts to the us parent company 
us taxes provided on these dividends amounted to million in valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
our annual testing date is june we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions mission support services defense systems transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we currently perform internal valuation analysis and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparisons with recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the three year discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios  influenced by an analysis of historical ratios  and by calculating a terminal value at the end of ten years 
the compound annual growth rates for sales ranged from to and for operating profit margins ranged from to for the reporting units  beyond the discrete forecast period 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at june  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
purchased intangibles we generally fund acquisitions using cash on hand 
the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition day  with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we amortize intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations over their estimated useful lives unless their useful lives are determined to be indefinite 
for certain business combinations  the amounts we record related to purchased intangibles are determined from independent valuations 
our purchased intangibles primarily relate to contracts and programs acquired and customer relationships  which are amortized over periods of years or less 
pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation  salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates  mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
changes in the above assumptions can affect our financial statements  although the relatively small size of our defined benefit pension plans limits the impact any individual assumption changes can have on earnings 
for example  a basis point change in the assumed rate of return on assets would have changed the pension expense recorded in by about million  before applicable income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt securities whose return is tied to short term interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us and new zealand which are also tied to short term rates the us prime rate and the new zealand base rate 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  the us  and new zealand 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we have in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap would be to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september  foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  singapore dollar  euro  swedish krona  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we do not believe that we are significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand  and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation  if any  and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
