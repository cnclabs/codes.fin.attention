overview we are a financial services company that primarily lends and invests in middle market  privately held companies 
we are a closed end investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt and equity of companies in need of capital for acquisitions  divestitures  growth  development  project financing and recapitalization 
we work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows  asset collateral or contracted pro forma cash flows 
the aggregate value of our portfolio investments was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june   our net cost of investments increased by  or  as we invested in three new and several follow on investments while we sold three investments and we received repayment on four other investments 
compared to the end of last fiscal year ended june   net assets increased by  or during the year ended june   from  to  this increase resulted from the issuance of new shares of our common stock less offering costs in the amount of  dividend reinvestments of  and another  from operations 
these increases  in turn  were offset by  in dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the  increase in net assets resulting from operations is net of the following net investment income of  realized loss on investments of  and a net increase in net assets due to changes in net unrealized appreciation of investments of  on june   we determined that the impairment of the change clean energy holdings  inc ccehi investment formerly known as worchester energy partners  inc wepi was other than temporarily impaired and recognized a realized loss for the amount by which the amortized cost exceeded the current fair value 
this loss was partially offset by realized gains from sales of the arctic acquisition corp 
arctic warrants and deep down  inc deep down common stock 
the net unrealized appreciation was driven by significant write ups of our investments in american gilsonite company agc  gas solutions holdings  inc gshi or gas solutions  nrg manufacturing  inc

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
basis of consolidation under the act rules  the regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x  and the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting guide for investment companies  we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services and benefits to us 
our june   and june  financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of prospect capital funding  llc  our only wholly owned  closely managed subsidiary that is also an investment company 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
investment classification we are a non diversified company within the meaning of the act 
we classify our investments by level of control 
as defined in the act  control investments are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company 
control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within days or less  a beneficial ownership of or more of the voting securities of an investee company 
affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within days or less  beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person 
investments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument 
investments are derecognized when we assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and forego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument 
specifically  we record all security transactions on a trade date basis 
investments in other  non security financial instruments are recorded on the basis of subscription date or redemption date  as applicable 
amounts for investments recognized or derecognized but not yet settled are reported as receivables for investments sold and payables for investments purchased  respectively  in the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities 
investment valuation our board of directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio 
these procedures are detailed below 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
for most of our investments  market quotations are not available 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with the independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors  the independent valuation firm conducts independent appraisals and makes their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firm  and the board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firm and the audit committee 
in september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
we adopted this statement on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter ended september  adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial position or results 
fas classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by the company at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
the changes to generally accepted accounting principles from the application of fas relate to the definition of fair value  framework for measuring fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by other standards 
in accordance with fas  the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted 
in april  fasb issued staff position no 
 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp fas 
fsp fas provides further clarification for the application of fas in markets that are not active and provides additional guidance for determining when the volume of trading level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
fsp fas is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the adoption of fsp fas for the year ended june   did not have any effect on our net asset value  financial position or results of operations as there was no change to the fair value measurement principles set forth in fas revenue recognition realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method 
interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination  closing and commitment fees are recorded as interest income 
loans are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management s judgment  are likely to remain current 
as of june   approximately of our net assets are in non accrual status 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
structuring fees and similar fees are recognized as income as earned  usually when paid 
structuring fees  excess deal deposits  net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other income 
federal and state income taxes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code of the code  applicable to regulated investment companies 
we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute or retain through a deemed distribution all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders  therefore  we have made no provision for income taxes 
the character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from gaap 
book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid in capital 
if we do not distribute or are not deemed to have distributed at least of its annual taxable income in the year earned  we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual taxable income exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for the year 
to the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income  we accrue excise taxes  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate 
the annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized  measured  presented  and disclosed in the financial statements 
fin requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year 
adoption of fin was applied to all open tax years as of july  the adoption of fin did not have an effect on our net asset value  financial condition or results of operations as there was no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and no change to our beginning net asset value 
as of june  and for the year then ended  we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits 
management s determinations regarding fin may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including  but not limited to  an on going analysis of tax laws  regulations and interpretations thereof 
dividends and distributions dividends and distributions to our common stockholders are recorded on the ex dividend date 
each quarter  the amount to be paid as a dividend  if any  is approved by the board of directors and is generally based upon management s estimate of earnings for the quarter 
net realized capital gains  if any  are distributed at least annually 
financing costs we record origination expenses related to its credit facility as deferred financing costs 
these expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method  over the stated life of the facility 
we record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid assets 
these expenses consist principally of sec registration  legal and accounting fees incurred through june  that are related to the shelf filings that will be charged to capital upon the receipt of the capital or charged to expense if not completed 
guarantees and indemnification agreements we follow fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  for those guarantees that are covered by fin  the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees

this yield includes interest from all of our long term investments as well as dividends from gshi and nrg for the year ended june  and ajax  gshi and nrg for the year ended june  the decrease is primarily due to loans which have been classified as non accrual status during the fiscal year ended june  for the year ended june   total foregone interest related to loans on non accrual status was  monetization of other equity positions that we hold is not included in this yield calculation

as defined in the act  control investments are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company 
control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within days or less  a beneficial ownership of or more of the voting securities of an investee company 
affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within days or less  beneficial ownership of or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person 
the following is a summary of our investment portfolio by level of control june  june  level of control fair value percent of portfolio fair value percent of portfolio control   affiliate   non control non affiliate   money market funds   total portfolio   investment valuation in determining the fair value of our portfolio investments at june   the audit committee considered valuations from the independent valuation firm and from management having an aggregate range of  to  excluding money market investments 
in determining the range of value for debt instruments  management and the independent valuation firm generally shadow rated the investment and then based upon the range of ratings  determined appropriate yields to maturity for a loan rated as such 
a discounted cash flow analysis was then prepared using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate  yielding the ranges 
for equity investments  the enterprise value was determined by applying ebitda multiples for similar recent investment sales 
for stressed equity investments  a liquidation analysis was prepared 
the board of directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including recent operating and financial trends for the asset  independent ratings obtained from third parties and comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry 
the composite of all these analysis  applied to each investment  was a total valuation of  excluding money market investments 
our investments are generally lower middle market companies  outside of the financial sector  with less than  of annual ebitda 
we believe our market has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments 
in addition  the middle market relies on less leverage than the large capitalization marketplace  which we believe will result in less financial distress 
during the fiscal year ended june   several general economic factors have occurred which have affected the valuation of our investment portfolio 
generally  interest rates offered on loans similar to those that we have originated have changed since our investments were consummated 
while we do not believe that there has been any diminution of credit quality  general changes in current interest rates would affect the price for which we could sell these assets and we have adjusted our fair value of these assets to reflect such changes 
we have adjusted the value of fourteen debt investments based upon such general changes in market interest rates including agc  biotronic  c j  castro  freedom marine services llc  h m oil gas  llc  iec ars  maverick healthcare  llc  peerless  resco products  inc resco  shearer s  stryker  trizetto and unitek 
seven debt investments were made to companies that are not performing in line with budget expectations as of june  these investments ajax  aeh  conquest  deb shops  ics  iron horse  and wind river resources corp 
and wind river ii corp 
wind river are well collateralized and we expect full recovery 
for these assets  we have increased the market interest rates to take into account the increased credit risk and general changes in current interest rates for similar assets to determine their fair value 
control investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments 
operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter 
significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment 
several control assets in our portfolio are under enhanced scrutiny by our senior management and our board of directors and are discussed below 
gas solutions holdings  inc gshi is an investment that we made in september in which we own of the equity 
gshi is a midstream gathering and processing business located in east texas 
gshi has improved its operations and we have experienced an increase in revenue  gross margin  and ebitda the later two metrics on both an absolute and a percentage of revenues basis over the past five years 
during the past year  we have been in discussions with multiple interested purchasers for gas solutions 
while we wish to unlock the value in gas solutions  we do not wish to enter into any agreement at any time that does not recognize the long term value we see in gas solutions 
as a well hedged midstream asset  which will generate predictable and consistent cash flows to us  gas solutions is a valuable asset that we wish to sell at a value maximizing price  or not at all 
we continue discussions with interested parties  but have a patient approach toward the process 
in addition  a sale of the assets  rather than the stock of gshi  might result in a significant tax liability at the gshi level which will need to be paid prior to any distribution to us 
in late march  royal bank of canada provided a  term loan to gas solutions ii ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of gshi  the proceeds of which were used to refinance all of citibank s approximately  of outstanding senior secured debt and provide liquidity to gshi 
in december  we lent an additional  to gshi  which enabled the company to repay the loan to the royal bank of canada 
upon repayment  our existing loan position moved to a first lien position in gshi  improving our borrowing base requirements with our lender 
in june  we lent an additional  to gshi in the form of junior secured debt to enable gshi to dividend additional retained earnings and profits 
in early may  gas solutions ii ltd purchased a series of propane puts at out of the money and at prices of per gallon and per gallon covering the periods may   through april   and may   through april   respectively 
these hedges were executed at close to the highest market propane prices ever achieved on an historical basis  such hedges preserve the upside of gas solutions ii ltd to benefit from potential future increases in commodity prices 
gshi generated approximately  of ebitda for the fiscal year ending december   an increase of from results 
despite the decline in oil and natural gas over the last year  gshi generated approximately  of ebitda for the twelve months ending april  in determining the value of gshi  we have utilized several valuation techniques to determine the value of the investment 
these techniques offer a wide range of values 
our board of directors has determined the value to be  for our debt and equity positions at june  based upon a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis  a public comparables analysis and review of recent indications of interest 
at june   gshi is valued  above its amortized cost at june   compared to the  unrealized gain recorded at june  integrated contract services  inc our investment in ics is under enhanced review by our senior management team due to existing payment and covenant defaults under the contracts governing these investments 
prior to january  ics owned the assets of esa environmental specialists  inc esa and of the stock of the healing staff ths 
esa originally defaulted under our contract governing our investment in esa  prompting us to commence foreclosure actions with respect to certain esa assets in respect of which we have a priority lien 
in response to our actions  esa filed voluntarily for reorganization under the bankruptcy code on august  on september  the us bankruptcy court approved a section asset sale from esa to us 
to complete this transaction  we contributed our esa debt to a newly formed entity  ics  and provided funds for working capital on october  in return for the esa debt  we received senior secured debt in ics of equal amount to our esa debt  preferred stock of ics  and of the ics common stock 
ics subsequently ceased operations and assigned the collateral back to us 
ics is in default of both payment and financial covenants 
during september and october  we provided  to ths for working capital 
in january  we foreclosed on the real and personal property of ics 
through this foreclosure process  we gained ownership of ths and certain esa assets 
based upon an analysis of the liquidation value of the esa assets and the enterprise value of ths  our board of directors reaffirmed the fair value of our investment in ics at  at june   a reduction of  from its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized loss recorded at june  yatesville coal holdings  inc all of our coal holdings have been consolidated under common management in yatesville 
yatesville began to show improvement after the consolidation of the coal holdings  but the company exhausted its permitted reserves in december and has not had any meaningful revenue stream since 
yatesville s management continues to pursue additional mine permits and received its first new permit in may for approximately  tons 
yatesville has elected not to begin production from its new permit and is investigating alternative revenue streams 
these actions have been complicated and impacted by an environment where coal prices are depressed from historical norms 
we continue to evaluate strategies for yatesville such as selling unneeded equipment and reserves 
during the year ended june   we provided additional funding of  to yatesville to fund ongoing operations and received back on our loan 
our board of directors  upon recommendation from senior management  has set the value of the yatesville investment at  at june   a reduction of  from its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized loss recorded at june  change clean energy holdings inc and change clean energy  inc  f k a worcester energy partners  inc change clean energy  inc ccei is under enhanced review by our senior management team due to poor operating results 
in march ccei ceased operations temporarily as it was not economically feasible to make a profit based on the cost of materials and the price being paid for electricity 
during that quarter  we determined that it was appropriate to institute foreclosure proceedings against the co borrowers of our debt to take full control of the assets 
in anticipation of such proceedings ccehi was established and on march   the foreclosure was completed and the assets were assigned to a wholly owned subsidiary of ccehi 
during the year ended june   we provided additional funding of  to ccei and to ccehi to fund ongoing operations 
ccei currently has no material operations 
we have determined that the current impairment at both ccei and ccehi is other than temporary and have recognized a realized loss of  for the year ended june   which is the amount by which the amortized cost exceeded the fair value at june  of  as set by our board of directors 
we had recorded an unrealized loss of  at june  capitalization our investment activities are capital intensive and the availability and cost of capital is a critical component of our business 
we capitalize our business with a combination of debt and equity 
our debt is currently consists of a revolving credit facility availing us of the ability to borrow debt subject to borrowing base determinations and our equity capital is currently comprised entirely of common equity 
on june   we completed a first closing on an expanded  syndicated revolving credit facility the facility 
the new facility  for which lenders have closed on  to date  includes an accordion feature which allows the facility to accept up to an aggregate total of  of commitments for which we continue to solicit additional commitments from other lenders for the additional  the revolving period of the facility extends through june  with an additional one year amortization period after the completion of the revolving period 
as of june  and  we had  and  of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  respectively 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility was one month libor plus basis points prior to june   increasing to one month libor plus basis points  subject to a minimum libor floor of basis points after that date 
the maintenance of this facility requires us to pay a fee for the amount not drawn upon 
prior to june   this fee was assessed at the rate of basis points per annum of the amount of that unused portion  after that date this rate increased to basis points per annum 
the following table shows the facility amounts and outstanding borrowings at june  and june  june  june  facility amount amount outstanding facility amount amount outstanding revolving credit facility     payments due by period less than year years more than years revolving credit facility  during the year ended june   we completed three stock offerings and raised  of additional equity by issuing  shares of our common stock below net asset value diluting shareholder value by per share 
the following table shows the calculation of net asset value per share as of june  and june as of june  as of june  net assets   shares of common stock outstanding   net asset value per share our most recently estimated nav per share is on an as adjusted basis solely to give effect to our payment of the july dividend recorded on ex dividend date of july  and issuance of common shares on july  in connection with our dividend reinvestment plan  and issuances on july  and august  in underwritten common and unregistered direct common stock offerings  respectively  versus determined by us as of june  nav as of september  may be higher or lower than based on potential changes in valuations 
our board of directors has not yet determined the fair value of portfolio investments subsequent to june  our board of directors determines the fair value of our portfolio investments on a quarterly basis in connection with the preparation of quarterly financial statements and based on input from an independent valuation firm  our investment advisor and the audit committee of our board of directors 
at june   we had  shares of our common stock outstanding 
results of operations net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the years ended june   and was   and  respectively  representing  and per weighted average share  respectively 
during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per weighted average share primarily from the write downs of our investments in ccei and yatesville 
during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per weighted average share primarily from the sales of our investments in advantage oilfield group and central illinois energy at a loss 
during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per weighted average share primarily from the write downs of our investments in advantage oilfield group 
while we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses  our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate as these companies are typically not issuing securities rated investment grade  have limited resources  have limited operating history  are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents 
changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company 
investment income we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own  dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own  and amortized loan origination fees on the structuring of new deals 
our investments  if in the form of debt securities  will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
to the extent achievable  we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies assets 
we also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies  which may pay cash or in kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis 
in addition  we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees 
any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned 
investment income  which consists of interest income  including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees  dividend income and other income  including settlement of net profits interests  overriding royalty interests and structuring fees  was   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
drivers of these increases include increased assets generating increased interest and dividend income along with increased income from royalty and settlement of net profits interests 
the following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments year ended june  year ended june  year ended june  interest income    dividend income    other income    total investment income    average debt principal of investments   weighted average interest rate earned total investment income has increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  investment income has been increasing as we continue to deploy the additional capital  raised in both debt and equity offerings  in revenue producing assets 
average interest income producing assets have increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  while we have been able to increase the gross amount of interest income  average yields on interest bearing assets have decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  these decreases are the result of our increasing our asset mix in financings with private equity sponsors 
we believe that such financings offer less risk  and consequently lower yields  due  in part  to lesser risk to our capital resulting from larger equity at risk underneath our capital 
holding these types of investments has allowed us to more effectively utilize our credit facility to finance such assets at an average rate of for the year ended june  additionally  during the year ended june   interest of  was foregone on non accrual debt investments compared to  and  of foregone interest for the year ended june  and june   respectively 
without these adjustments  the weighted average interest rates earned on debt investments would have been  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
investment income is also generated from dividends and other income 
dividend income has grown significantly from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  we have received dividends from our investments in gshi  r v  ajax  c j and nrg 
the increase in dividend income is mostly attributable to dividends received from our investment in gshi  which were  and  during the years ended june  and june   respectively 
other income has come primarily from structuring fees  overriding royalty interests  and settlement of net profits interests 
income from other sources has grown significantly from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  during the year ended june  we received royalty income and settlement of net profits interest of  in the aggregate related to ken tex energy corp  and  of structuring fees related to ajax  h m and various other portfolio investments 
during the year ended june   structuring fees of  were received primarily related to biotronic and gshi  a decrease of  from the year ended june  the increase in other income for the year ended june  is largely due to the settlement of our net profit interests in iec ars for  operating expenses our primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory fees base and incentive fees  credit facility costs  legal and professional fees and other operating and overhead related expenses 
these expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement with prospect administration under which prospect administration provides administrative services and facilities for us 
our investment advisory fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with our administration agreement with prospect administration 
operating expenses were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the base investment advisory expenses were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
these increases are directly related to our growth in total assets 
  and  in income incentive fees were earned for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the increases in the income incentive fees are driven by our stronger performance with respect to net investment income as evidenced by net operating income ratios of  and for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
no capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the investment advisory agreement 
during the years ended june   june  and june   we incurred   and  respectively  of expenses related to our credit facilities 
these expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those years and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those years 
the table below describes the various credit facility expenses and the related indicators of leveraging capacity and indebtedness 
year ended june  year ended june  year ended june  interest expense   amortization of deferred financing costs  commitment and other fees total    weighted average debt outstanding    weighted average interest rate facility amount at beginning of year    the decrease in our interest rate incurred is primarily due to a decrease in average libor of approximately for the year ended june  in comparison to and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease is partially offset by an increase of basis points in our current borrowing rate effective november  as our asset base has grown and we have added complexity to our capital raising activities  due  in part  to our securitization credit facility initiated in june  we have commensurately increased the size of our administrative and financial staff  accounting for a significant increase in the overhead allocation from prospect administration 
over the last year  prospect administration has added several additional staff members  including a senior finance professional  a treasurer  a corporate counsel and other finance professionals 
as our portfolio continues to grow  we expect to continue to increase the size of our administrative and financial staff on a basis that provides increasing returns to scale 
however  initial investments in administrative and financial staff may not provide returns to scale immediately  perhaps not until the portfolio increases to a greater size 
other allocated expenses from prospect administration have  as expected  increased alongside with the increase in staffing and asset base 
legal costs decreased significantly from  for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  as there were reduced costs for litigation

net realized losses gains were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
on june   we determined that the impairment of the ccehi investment was other than temporarily impaired and recognized a realized loss for the amount by which the amortized cost exceeded the current fair value 
this loss was partially offset by realized gains from sales of the arctic warrants and deep down common stock 
the net realized loss of  sustained in the year ended june  was due mainly to the sale of charlevoix and advantage oilfield group ltd 
aog while the  realized gain registered for the year ended june  is attributable to the sale of evolution petroleum corporation 
increase decrease in net assets from changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation was   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
for the year ended june   the net unrealized appreciation was driven by significant write ups of our investments in agc  gshi  nrg  r v  shearer s and stryker  and by the disposition of previously written down investment in ccei mentioned above  which  in turn  were offset by significant write downs our investments in ajax  aeh  conquest  deb shops  iron horse and yatesville as well as the elimination of the unrealized appreciation resulting from the sale of deep down mentioned above 
for the year ended june    of the decrease in net assets from the net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation was driven by significant write downs in our investments in ics  weco  and yatesville partially offset by the write up for our investment in gshi and by the disposition of previously written down investments in aog and esa 
for the year ended june    of the decrease in net assets from such changes is attributable to significant write downs of our investments in aog  esa  unity virginia holdings llc and whymore coal company inc which  in turn  were slightly offset by a significant write up in the value for gshi
