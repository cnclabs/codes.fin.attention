item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under forward looking statements and in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  mine  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals and  to a lesser extent  other sorbent materials 
our principal products include cat litter  industrial and automotive floor absorbents  fluids purification and filtration bleaching clays  agricultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end customer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
we have two reportable operating segments based on the different characteristics of our two primary customer groups retail and wholesale products group and business to business products group 
each operating segment is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business above 
we had net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   a increase over net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income was positively impacted by a higher average net selling price due to strategic pricing and the mix of products sold  with some products contributing more to net income than others 
net income was negatively impacted by higher costs of natural gas and recycled fuel oil used to dry our clay and resin materials used to package our products 
the global effect of the economic downturn during fiscal impacted demand for products in both our domestic and foreign markets and resulted in a decrease in total tons sold 
in our retail and wholesale products group  competition for our consumer products increased as consumer spending declined 
the downturn in the manufacturing and automotive industries reduced demand for our industrial absorbents 
in our business to business products group  our agricultural chemical carrier sales declined in both the agricultural and the lawn and garden markets 
sales of our sports products declined due to the negative impact of economic conditions on municipalities and other recreational baseball customers 
the weak global economy along with a good quality soybean crop resulted in lower tons sold for our bleaching earth products 
our continued focus on our corporate strategy to create value from sorbent minerals helped us contend with these challenging times 
we introduced new products in both groups and continued our commitment to research and development to create new products and to improve existing products 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal both our retail and wholesale products group and our business to business products group contributed to the net sales increase 
net income for the year was  an increase of from net income of  in fiscal the retail and wholesale products group contributed to the improved net income as higher average net selling prices overcame lower volume and increased costs  however  in the business to business products group the lower volume and higher costs prevailed over higher average net selling prices 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal higher average net selling prices and a favorable product sales mix provided for increased sales in fiscal despite lower tons sold for the group compared to fiscal net sales of co packaged cat litter  animal health and nutrition and agricultural chemical carrier products all increased  while net sales of fluids purification and sports related products decreased 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales were up in fiscal a increase in tons sold due to product improvements and a higher average net selling price more than offset the loss of a small co package customer during fiscal net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose due primarily to increased average net selling prices and the introduction of new mycotoxin binder products 
net sales of agricultural chemical carriers were up approximately due primarily to a higher average net selling price that more than offset approximately lower tons sold 
agricultural chemical carriers tons sold declined in the agricultural and the lawn and garden markets due primarily to the poor economy 
net sales of bleaching earth and fluid purification products were down from fiscal as a decline in tons sold outweighed a higher average net selling price 
the lower tons sold for bleaching earth products resulted from a weak global economy and a good quality soybean crop  which required less bleaching clay to process the oil 
sales of our baseball related products declined due to the negative impact of economic conditions on municipalities and other recreational baseball customers 
sales of golf related products decreased upon the loss of a distributor 
the business to business products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal approximately higher combined materials  packaging and freight costs more than offset a higher average net selling price 
materials costs increased approximately due to the higher cost for fuel used to dry our clay based products compared to the prior fiscal year 
freight costs were approximately higher compared to fiscal although diesel fuel and ocean freight prices declined  particularly in the later part of fiscal  the average cost for fiscal was greater than for fiscal conversely  packaging costs declined approximately due primarily to lower costs of paper used in packaging 
selling and administrative expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to marketing and promotional activities for our new mycotoxin binder product 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the group s net sales growth was driven by increased average net selling prices and a favorable product sales mix that overcame a decrease in tons sold 
net sales of cat litter products increased approximately in fiscal private label cat litter net sales increased approximately due to higher average net selling prices accompanied by a increase in tons sold 
branded cat litter net sales also increased approximately due to a higher average net selling price that offset a decline in tons sold 
branded coarse cat litter tons sold declined  however  our branded scoopable cat litter tons sold increased as a result of new natural products and marketing programs 
wal mart  our largest customer  informed us in june that its stores will carry a reduced number of cat litter brands beginning in august  the first month of our fiscal year we expect to maintain a private label relationship with this customer 
as disclosed in our june press release regarding this development  we believe this change will have a material negative impact on fiscal net sales and net income 
our intention is to moderate the impact on our consolidated financial results of the expected reduction in sales to wal mart through expanded distribution to other customers  new product introductions  cost saving initiatives and product sales mix improvement 
net sales of domestic industrial absorbents were flat as a higher average net selling price offset a decline in tons sold due to poor economic conditions in the manufacturing and automotive industries 
net sales of our foreign subsidiaries decreased with a decline in tons sold 
both our united kingdom and canadian subsidiaries have been negatively impacted by unfavorable local currency fluctuations compared to the us dollar and the worldwide economic slowdown 
see foreign operations below for further information regarding our foreign subsidiaries results 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal a higher average net selling price overcame an approximate increase in combined freight  materials and packaging costs 
packaging costs increased approximately due primarily to higher resin costs 
material costs increased approximately due primarily to the higher cost for fuel used to dry our clay based products compared to the prior fiscal year 
freight costs were less than the prior fiscal year as lower diesel prices reduced domestic freight costs  particularly in the later part of fiscal selling and administrative expenses were greater in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal advertising costs increased due to several marketing campaigns to enhance our brand awareness 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal cost of sales for fiscal was reduced by  as a result of the sale of emission reduction credits  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which increased our consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal by approximately 
gross profit improved in fiscal due primarily to a higher average net selling price which overcame increased manufacturing and packaging costs 
the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing process was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal non fuel manufacturing costs  including depreciation and amortization  increased over the same period of the prior fiscal year 
significant manufacturing cost increases were in purchased materials  repairs  labor and non kiln fuel 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal to from in fiscal the discussion of the groups operating income above describes the increased selling and administrative expenses that were allocated to our operating segments 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses were lower in fiscal due primarily to lower expenses for the estimated incentive bonus  research and development and stock option compensation 
the lower fiscal incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each year 
research and development costs were lower as we moved further through the development cycle for several new products 
stock option compensation was lower as more stock options became fully vested and no new options were issued 
these lower expenses were partially offset by higher pension and rent expense 
interest expense in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in debt outstanding 
interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to lower average interest rates and lower average investment balances 
other income in fiscal increased  from fiscal other income in fiscal included income relating to a lease arrangement with a co packaging partner 
other income in fiscal included expenses associated with examinations by regulatory agencies 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal due to increased income  a lower deduction for mining depletion due to reduced tonnage and an unfavorable tax impact from the results of foreign operations 
total assets increased  during fiscal current assets decreased  or  from the fiscal year end balances primarily due to decreased investments in treasury securities and accounts receivable 
these decreases were partially offset by increased cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses 
these changes are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  due primarily to capital projects related to new product development at our manufacturing facilities and the purchase of land 
other noncurrent assets increased  from fiscal due to a higher deferred tax asset partially offset by a decrease in a lease receivable with a co packaging partner 
total liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal current liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal the changes in current liabilities are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
noncurrent liabilities increased  due primarily to higher accruals for pension and post retirement benefits and deferred compensation partially offset by a reduction in long term debt due to scheduled payments 
the increased pension and post retirement benefit accruals were driven by the actuarially calculated benefit obligations and lower pension asset values as of july  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on employee benefit plans 
deferred compensation accruals increased due to new deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess of payouts 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal both our retail and wholesale products group and our business to business products group contributed to the sales improvement 
our focus on strategic pricing company wide to contend with rising costs resulted in an increased average net selling price 
in addition  total tons sold for fiscal year increased 
net income for the year was  an increase of from net income of  in fiscal net income was positively impacted by higher average net selling prices  increased tons sold and an  reduction in cost of sales from the sale of emission reduction credits  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income was negatively affected by higher freight  materials and packaging costs 
freight costs increased significantly due to record high fuel prices which impacted our truck  rail and ship distribution channels 
materials costs were driven upward by the high cost of fuel used to dry our clay based products and to transport raw materials 
the cost of purchased packaging materials increased due to price increases in the resin and paper markets 
the business to business products group contributed to the improved net income as higher net selling prices overcame lower volume and increased costs  however  in the retail and wholesale products group the higher costs prevailed over increases in both net selling prices and volume 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal total tons sold for the group were down compared to fiscal  however  higher average net selling prices provided for increased sales in fiscal net sales of fluids purification products  co packaged cat litter products and animal health and nutrition products all increased 
net sales of bleaching earth and fluids purification products increased due to higher average net selling prices and more tons sold 
the increased tonnage was the result of additional business opportunities in both domestic and export markets and in the biodiesel production industry 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales were up in fiscal selling price increases and a new co packaging customer offset a decline in tons sold 
tons sold decreased as coarse cat litter sales continued to decline in the overall cat litter market while scoopable cat litter sales continued to increase 
net sales of animal health and nutrition products rose primarily due to increased tons sold and increased average net selling prices for our mycotoxin binder and animal feed binder products 
in contrast  net sales of agricultural chemical carriers were down due to lower tons sold caused by continued market erosion from the growth of genetically modified seed and seed treatments 
tons sold for the group s flo fre product line a by product of the manufacture of our agricultural chemical carriers also declined  however  the impact of lower volume was offset by a higher average net selling price which resulted in an increase in net sales 
net sales of sports field products were down as the result of the loss of a customer 
the business to business products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal average net selling price increases were partially offset by approximately higher combined freight  materials and packaging costs 
freight costs increased approximately due to higher diesel fuel prices 
packaging costs were driven upward by price increases in the resin and paper markets 
selling and administrative expenses were only higher in fiscal compared to fiscal higher marketing costs in fiscal were mostly offset by lower bad debt expense 
bad debt expense was higher in fiscal due to the write off of a receivable from a sports product customer 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  reported in fiscal the net sales growth was driven by increases in both overall net selling prices and tons sold 
the group s total tons sold were up  including an increase in cat litter tons 
net sales of private label cat litter increased due to selling price increases and more volume 
the higher volume was the result of expanded distribution to existing customers  as well as distribution to new customers 
the group s net sales were also positively impacted by reduced trade spending costs trade spending costs are reported as a reduction of net sales 
partially offsetting these net sales increases was a reduction in branded cat litter net sales due to loss of a customer 
net sales of synthetic and clay based industrial absorbents were also both down due to lower volume 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to higher costs 
the group s combined freight  materials and packaging costs increased approximately during fiscal record high fuel prices resulted in freight costs approximately higher than in fiscal the group s product margins were also negatively impacted by higher packaging and materials costs as described above 
these higher costs exceeded the improvement in the group s net sales 
selling and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal advertising costs were higher due to packaging re design and market research costs 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal cost of sales for fiscal was reduced by  as a result of the sale of emission reduction credits  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which increased our consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal by approximately 
increased average net selling prices in fiscal did not overcome increased freight  materials and packaging costs 
gross profit was further reduced by a increase in the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing process in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal decreased to from the in fiscal the discussion of the groups operating income above describes the fluctuation in the selling  general and administrative expenses that were allocated to our operating segments 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses were lower in fiscal due primarily to decreases in the estimated incentive bonus and audit fees 
the lower fiscal incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each year 
audit expense was higher in fiscal when we became an accelerated filer and were required for the first time to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to a reduction in debt outstanding 
interest income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal due to lower average interest rates that offset the benefits of higher average investment balances 
other income in fiscal decreased  from fiscal other income in fiscal included proceeds received from life insurance policies on former employees 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal the effective tax rate was lower in fiscal primarily due to an increased deduction for mining depletion 
total assets increased  or  during fiscal current assets increased  or  from the fiscal year end balances primarily due to increased accounts receivable  investments in treasury securities and inventories 
these increases were partially offset by decreased cash and cash equivalents 
these changes are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
other assets increased  from fiscal due to the  purchase of strategic intangible assets for the retail and wholesale products group and a lease receivable relating to a co packaging agreement for the business to business products group 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  was consistent with the year end balance in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal were approximately equal to depreciation expense 
total liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal noncurrent liabilities decreased  due to payment on long term debt 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in the accrued postretirement benefits and deferred compensation  as described in notes and  respectively  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
current liabilities increased  or  during fiscal the changes in current liabilities are described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company net sales 
this represents a decrease of  or  from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary net sales were  or of total company net sales 
net sales and tons sold decreased in both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
industrial absorbent sales were down for both subsidiaries as the worldwide economic slowdown impacted sales through reduced orders 
aggressive competition in the canadian cat litter market also resulted in some reduced sales and the loss of a customer 
in addition  the british pound was approximately weaker and the canadian dollar was approximately weaker against the us dollar for fiscal compared to fiscal  which resulted in lower sales values after translation to us dollars 
for fiscal our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  a decrease of  from the  net income reported in fiscal the lower tons sold and currency impacts described above contributed to the net loss  along with increased material and freight costs 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  most of the decrease in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventories 
net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company net sales 
this represents an increase of  or  from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary net sales were  or of total company net sales 
net sales increased in both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
our canadian subsidiary s net sales increase was primarily due to a higher net selling price that overcame lower tons sold 
the lower volume was primarily in private label cat litter sales due to the loss of a customer 
for fiscal our foreign subsidiaries reported net income of  an increase of  from the  net income reported in fiscal net selling price increases improved results for both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
our canadian subsidiary also obtained a greater portion of a raw material from an alternative lower cost source during fiscal our swiss subsidiary reported lower income taxes in fiscal due to additional taxes recognized in fiscal related to the repatriation of untaxed earnings 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  most of the increase in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents  inventories and accounts receivable 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  the purchasing and upgrading of real estate  equipment and facilities  and investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we have principally used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash and cash equivalents totaled   and  at july   and  respectively 
as of july  there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with harris na the following table sets forth certain elements of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands fiscal year ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities    effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal net cash provided by operations was  an increase of  from fiscal  due primarily to an increase in other liabilities and changes in working capital 
other liabilities increased in fiscal due to higher postretirement benefit liabilities based on actuarially calculated benefit obligations and lower pension asset values as of july  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee benefit plans 
deferred compensation increased  due to continued deferrals and earnings on deferred balances in excess of payouts 
the other significant changes in working capital are described below 
in fiscal net cash provided by operations was  a decrease of  from fiscal  due primarily to changes in working capital and an increase other assets that offset an increase other liabilities 
other assets increased due primarily to a lease receivable relating to a co packaging agreement in the business to business products group 
other liabilities increased due to higher postretirement benefit liabilities 
the changes in the primary components of working capital that impacted operating cash flows for these years are as follows accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the decrease was due primarily to lower fiscal fourth quarter sales  particularly during the month of july 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was due in part to strong fiscal fourth quarter net sales which were greater than fiscal fourth quarter net sales 
inventories were up slightly at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due to a higher finished goods inventory that offset a lower packaging inventory 
inventories increased by  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end reflecting the higher cost of materials  packaging and fuel and increased inventory levels 
inventory levels increased due to production planning and service level requirements 
accounts payable decreased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end as the result of fewer purchases due to lower sales and production levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal similarly  accrued freight decreased  and other accrued expenses decreased  at fiscal year end accounts payable increased  at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to higher costs for purchased items  particularly energy and packaging 
timing of payments also impacts all year end accounts payable balances 
net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal during fiscal net dispositions of investment securities was  compared to net purchases of investment securities of  in fiscal in fiscal proceeds from disposition of investment securities were used to fund higher requirements for capital expenditures and debt payments 
in addition  during fiscal we modified our investment strategy to allocate a greater portion of our financial resources to investments versus cash 
purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods are also subject to variations in the timing of investment maturities 
capital expenditures were  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal significant capital projects related to new product development at our manufacturing facilities and the purchase of land used cash in fiscal during fiscal we also used  to purchase strategic intangible assets in the retail and wholesale products group 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal versus  in fiscal during fiscal net purchases of investment securities were  compared to net dispositions of  in fiscal during fiscal we modified our investment strategy to allocate a greater portion of our financial resources to investments versus cash 
purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods are also subject to variations in the timing of investment maturities 
during fiscal we also used  to purchase strategic intangible assets in the retail and wholesale products group 
capital expenditures were  lower in fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we used cash in fiscal primarily for principal payments on long term debt  dividends and purchases of treasury stock 
payments on long term debt were  higher in fiscal in accordance with our debt agreements 
cash used to purchase treasury stock was  higher in fiscal dividends paid were  higher in fiscal due to a dividend increase 
in addition  proceeds from issuance of treasury stock and common stock during fiscal were  lower as a result of less stock option exercise activity 
cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we used cash in fiscal primarily for principal payments on long term debt and dividends 
dividend payments were  higher in fiscal due to a dividend increase  however  proceeds from issuance of treasury stock and common stock during fiscal were  higher as a result of more stock option exercise activity 
other total cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries at july   and were   and  respectively 
cash and investment balances fluctuated due to normal business operations 
as part of the normal course of business  we guarantee certain debts and trade payables of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these arrangements are made at the request of the subsidiaries creditors  as separate financial statements are not distributed for the wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of july  the value of these guarantees was  of lease liabilities 
on december  we signed an amendment to extend our  unsecured revolving credit agreement with harris na harris that was set to expire on january  the amended agreement is effective until december  and changes certain terms of the original agreement 
the credit agreement with harris provides that we may select a variable rate based on either harris prime rate or a libor based rate  plus a margin which varies depending on our debt to earnings ratio  or a fixed rate as agreed between us and harris 
at july  the variable rates would have been for the harris prime based rate or for the libor based rate 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july  and there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with its covenants 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our revolving credit facility and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
we expect cash requirements for capital expenditures in fiscal to decrease from fiscal due primarily to completion of capital projects at our manufacturing facilities 
during fiscal we had capital expenditures of approximately  related to construction of a new plant to produce engineered granules and land purchases 
our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including  but not limited to  the credit agreement  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt     interest on long term debt     operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations   the unconditional purchase obligations represent forward purchase contracts we have entered into for a portion of our natural gas fuel needs for fiscal and as of july  the remaining purchase obligation was  for  mmbtu for fiscal and  for  mmbtu for fiscal these contracts were entered into in the normal course of business and no contracts were entered into for speculative purposes 
in the third quarter of fiscal we made a contribution of  to our defined benefit pension plan 
we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for certain information regarding the potential impact of financial market fluctuations on pension plan assets and future funding contributions 
as of july  our non current liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately  we have not presented this obligation in the table above because the timing of future cash flows is dependent on examinations by taxing authorities and can not reasonably be estimated 
amount of commitment expiration per period total other commercial amounts less than commitments committed year years years after years other commercial commitments    total commercial commitments    the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
annually we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include promotional programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  pension accounting and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
trade receivables 
we recognize trade receivables when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer consistent with our revenue recognition policy 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
a customer is determined to be uncollectible when we have completed our internal collection procedures  including termination of shipments  direct customer contact and formal demand of payment 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  however  the unanticipated default by a customer with a material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the allowance not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
reclamation 
during the normal course of our overburden removal activities we perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill older sites 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability of the reclamation process 
on an annual basis we evaluate our potential reclamation liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
as amended  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
as of july  and we have recorded an estimated net reclamation asset of  and  respectively  and a corresponding estimated reclamation liability of  and  respectively 
these values represent the discounted present value of the estimated future mining reclamation costs at the production plants 
the reclamation assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the various mines 
the reclamation liabilities are increased based on a yearly accretion charge  once again over the estimated useful lives of the mines 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires that we make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in the future could differ from estimated amounts 
future changes to environmental laws could increase the extent of reclamation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amount incurred for reclamation costs 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
we review carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the first quarter of the fiscal year and we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
trade promotions and advertising 
we routinely commit to one time or ongoing trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
promotional reserves are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
to estimate trade promotion reserves  we rely on our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while we believe our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
advertising costs include printed materials  participation in industry conventions and shows and market research 
advertising costs for print media are expensed when the advertising occurs 
all other advertising costs are expensed when incurred 
all advertising costs are part of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have accrued liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated trade spending and advertising programs 
we recorded liabilities of  and  for trade promotions and advertising at july  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock options and restricted stock issued under our long term incentive plans in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date and the recognition in the financial statements of the related compensation expense over the appropriate vesting period 
the fair value of stock based compensation was estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method 
this method requires management to make certain estimates  including estimating the expected term of stock options  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized share based compensation expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  net of related tax effect 
these amounts include expense related to stock option grants and amortization of restricted stock 
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we calculate our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations using actuarial models 
to measure the expense and obligations  we must make a variety of estimates including critical assumptions for the discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
as these assumptions change from period to period  recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate is the rate assumed to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due 
the discount rate is subject to change each year 
we refer to an applicable index and the expected duration of the benefit payments to select a discount rate at which we believe the benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate for fiscal and was the single equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as the plan s expected cashflows discounted with spot rates on a yield curve of investment grade corporate bonds 
the yield curve is the citigroup pension liability index 
in fiscal  the discount rate assumption was a benchmark rate based on the citigroup pension liability index 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of plan assets  which is the fair market value 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the tax effect of the expected reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could effect the realization of deferred tax assets 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance at july  has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax benefit related to our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards since we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit of these credits will not be realized

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and employ policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we had two offsetting interest rate swap agreements with the same counterparty as of july  we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risk  primarily us dollar british pound  us dollar euro and us dollar canadian dollar  as it relates to certain accounts receivables and our foreign operations 
foreign currency denominated accounts receivable is a small fraction of our consolidated accounts receivable 
we are also subject to translation exposure of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
in recent years  our foreign subsidiaries have not generated a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales or net income 
we do not enter into any hedge contracts in an attempt to offset any adverse effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
we believe that the foreign currency fluctuation risk is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to market risk at it relates to the investments of plan assets under our defined benefit pension plan 
the fair value of these assets is subject to change due to fluctuations in the financial markets 
the decline in the equity markets resulted in a lower value of our pension plan assets as of july  the lower asset value may increase our pension expense for fiscal and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of future funding contributions 
we are exposed to regulatory risk in the fluids purification  agricultural and animal health markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain in the united states and europe 
we actively monitor developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which we are a member 
we are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to fuel 
we contract for a portion of our anticipated fuel needs using forward purchase contracts to mitigate the volatility of our kiln fuel prices 
as of july  we have purchased natural gas contracts representing approximately of our planned kiln fuel needs for fiscal we estimate the weighted average cost of these natural gas contracts in fiscal to be approximately lower than the contracts in fiscal  however  this average will change if we continue to buy natural gas contracts 
we have also purchased contracts for a portion of our fuel requirements for fiscal to take advantage of declines in gas prices 
all contracts are related to the normal course of business and no contracts are entered into for speculative purposes 
the following table provides information about our natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts  the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  and the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on september  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of our natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed us to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued  and in some cases expanded  use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on our fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market 
please also see item a risk factors above for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face in our business
