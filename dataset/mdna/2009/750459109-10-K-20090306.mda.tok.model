item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have shifted more of our investments from predominantly perfect fit custom solutions to standards based solutions 
we believe standards based solutions provide our customers a number of fundamental benefits 
first  by using ready made platform solutions rather than ground start custom designs  our customers can achieve significantly shorter product intervals and faster time to market 
second  we believe our customers can achieve a lower total cost by using solutions that are leveraged across multiple applications rather than a single use proprietary solution 
by offering ready made solutions  we believe we have the opportunity to address a wider range of new market opportunities with the potential for faster time to revenue than with ground start  custom designs 
we believe this ability to reuse designs makes our business and investment model more scalable 
finally  we believe a more standards based product model will allow us to provide more integrated higher value solutions to our customers than we have typically delivered under a custom design model 
these higher value solutions drive higher price points and therefore more total revenue opportunities for our products 
financial results total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
backlog was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within months 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to increases in revenues in the communications networking market of million along with increased revenues of million in the commercial systems market 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to increases in revenues in the communications networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively 
revenues in the communications networking market increased from to primarily due to increases in next generation communication revenues from our intel mcpd acquisition  for which a full year of revenues were realized  as well as increases in revenues from organic atca and media server products 
revenues in the commercial systems market increased slightly during compared to  primarily due to increases within the other commercial submarket  which was partially offset by declines in revenues from the test and measurement and medical submarkets 
from a geographic perspective  from to non us revenues by delivery destination increased by million 
specifically  revenues from the asia pacific region increased by million in and represented of total revenues  up from in additionally  revenues from the emea region increased million and represented of total revenues  down from in increased revenues in both the asia pacific and emea regions were driven by the addition of asian pacific and european customer revenues resulting from our mcpd acquisition 
increased sales to nokia siemens networks further contributed to these increases 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america increased by million as compared to the same period in  but remained flat as a percent of total revenues 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of revenues from our mcpd acquisition as well as increased media server revenues 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increased mix of revenues from higher margin next generation communication products 
this increase was further driven by operational improvements leading to lower excess and obsolete charges as well as increased leverage of fixed costs 
in addition  gross margin improved favorably due to the absence of significant charges associated with the transition from our north carolina manufacturer  which occurred in during the year ended december   we also incurred a million charge associated with the full impairment of our goodwill balances 
a decline in our share price  during the fourth quarter of  was considered a triggering event  which prompted us to perform an impairment analysis that ultimately led to the impairment charge 
the charge was the result of our book value exceeding our fair value 

table of contents net loss was million  million  million in  and  respectively 
net loss per share was  and for  and  respectively 
the net loss increased from to  due primarily to the goodwill impairment charge totaling million 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to operating cash flows in the amount of million  which were partially offset by cash outflows for financing in the amount of million 
financing cash outflows were driven by repurchases of our convertible debt and offset partially by new borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
our investments totaled million at december  and million at december   which includes our ars settlement right 
the decrease is primarily due to sales of ars in the first quarter of in the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  we intend to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation we record the inventory valuation allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
pursuant to arb and sab topic bb  our inventory valuation allowances establish a new cost basis for inventory 
factors influencing the provision include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  regulatory requirements affecting components  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required 
our estimate for the allowance is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components 

table of contents adverse purchase commitments we are contractually obligated to reimburse our contract manufacturers for the cost of excess inventory used in the manufacture of our products  for which there is no alternative use 
excess inventory is defined as raw materials or assemblies components used in the manufacture of our products for which the contract manufacturers on hand and on order quantities are in excess of the requirements derived from our current product forecast of customer demand 
we are liable for excess inventory only to the extent that the contract manufacturer procures components to fulfill the manufacturing requirements as set forth in our current product forecast and agreed upon lead times and minimum order quantities 
unexpected decreases in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand could result in increases in our adverse purchase commitment liability and have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
factors influencing the adverse purchase commitments liability include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  customer liability and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may incur additional expenses due to increases in our adverse purchase commitment liabilities 
our estimate for the adverse purchase commitments liabilities is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations to us 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current adverse purchase commitments liabilities may be inadequate 
estimates for adverse purchase commitments are derived from reports received on a quarterly basis from our contract manufacturers 
increases to this liability are charged to cost of goods sold 
when and if we take possession of inventory reserved for in this liability  the liability is transferred from other liabilities to our excess and obsolete inventory valuation allowance 
this liability  referred to as adverse purchase commitments  is provided for in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
adverse purchase commitments amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include post sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by contract manufacturers is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for a specified period of time ranging from to months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer s warranty  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
accrued warranty reserves are included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
long lived assets our long lived assets include definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment 
the net balance of our definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment at december  amounted to million and million  respectively 
in previous years our long lived asset balance has included goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with prior acquisitions 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
additionally  we assess goodwill for impairment if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment  include  but are not limited to  i a significant decline in the company s market capitalization  ii a 
table of contents significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  iii or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
the company is considered one reporting unit 
as a result  goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level in a two step process  which consists of  first  comparing the company s fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the company s fair value exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
if the company s carrying value exceeds its fair value  there is an indication of impairment  in which case we would perform the second step  including a further and more detailed analysis in order to corroborate any such impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our annual goodwill impairment test was performed during the third quarter of general economic conditions combined with the resulting decline in the company s stock price  were considered triggering events that required us to re perform our goodwill impairment test at the end of the fourth quarter of to perform the test  a fair value for the company was estimated primarily based on the market approach  using the market capitalization method 
an impairment loss was then calculated based on an allocation of the fair value of the company to the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in a business combination 
this resulted in an impairment charge representing the entire balance of goodwill  which totaled million  net of adjustments and as of december  we had no remaining indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily consist of acquired patents  completed technology  technology licenses  trade names and customer lists 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  primarily consists of office equipment and software  manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and other physical assets owned by radisys 
property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from one to years 
we assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
conditions that would trigger a long lived asset impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if we determine that a long lived asset impairment assessment is required  we must determine the fair value of the asset  which is determined based on the associated value of estimated future cash flows 
we would estimate future cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to our business operations 
impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required in determining if and when a condition would trigger an impairment assessment of our long lived assets and once such a determination has been made  considerable management judgment is required to determine the fair market value of the long lived asset 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period or if and when a condition has triggered an impairment analysis of our long lived assets  we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write down or the write off of our long lived assets 
the triggering events that resulted in the impairment analysis of goodwill were also considered triggering events that required us to perform an impairment test of our long lived assets at the end of the fourth quarter of for our long lived assets  we determined no impairment existed 
however  during the analysis we noted that the benefit associated with certain of our intangible assets exceeded their remaining depreciable lives and therefore we adjusted their remaining depreciable lives prospectively 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding these changes in accounting estimate 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in our future tax returns 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
the net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate approximately million and million in taxable income in the united states and canada  respectively  prior to the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which will occur between and we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our two largest customers 
if one of these large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay the amounts due to us  the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
during the years ended december  and  there were no significant account balances reserved for and the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by  as a result of additional provisions partially offset by the write off of previously specifically identified account balances 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events and historical experience 
typically  this non specific bad debt reserve amounts to approximately of quarterly revenues 
accrued restructuring and other charges expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable 
because we have a history of paying severance benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for leased facilities that were vacated and subleased  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  was recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability 
table of contents to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by the following revenue recognition criteria an agreement with the customer  fixed pricing  transfer of title and risk of loss and customer acceptance  if applicable  and that the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  or for software  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we first allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
where the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined  we defer revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions under which we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  infrequently we enter into agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
non standard terms and conditions can include  but are not limited to  customer acceptance criteria or other post delivery obligations 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
the components of total revenues were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  hardware software royalties and licenses software maintenance engineering and other services total revenues hardware revenue from hardware products where software is incidental is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab under our standard terms and conditions of sale  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns for rotation rights as well as for price protection rights according to agreements with our distributors 
the amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the software content included in hardware products such as our atca systems  certain mcpd products and cms solutions are considered to be more than incidental and our atca arrangements generally include multiple elements such as hardware  technical support services as well as specified software upgrades or enhancements 
as such  the revenue associated with these products is recognized in accordance with statement of positions sop software revenue recognition sop software royalties and licenses revenue from software royalties and licenses is recognized in accordance with sop revenue from customers for prepaid  non refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for non prepaid royalties is recognized at the time the underlying product is shipped by the 
table of contents customer paying the royalty 
we recognize software license revenue at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the software provided all relevant revenue recognition criteria have been met and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we defer revenue on arrangements including specified software upgrades until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
software maintenance software maintenance services are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the terms of the contract in accordance with sop the fair value of our post contract support has been determined by renewal rates within the company s support agreements as well as the actual amounts charged to customers for renewal of their support services 
engineering and other services engineering services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered in accordance with sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects 
hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete 
software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
deferred income deferred income represents amounts received or billed for the following types of transactions distributor sales certain sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges and price protection rights terminate  at which time related estimated distributor resale revenue  estimated effects of distributor price adjustments  and estimated costs are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
during the first quarter of  we entered into new arrangements with our significant distributors servicing the mcpd business 
for a few of these distributors  we eliminated some of the price adjustment programs 
for those distributors where significant price adjustment programs remain in place  we will continue to defer revenue until the distributors sell the merchandise 
our revenue reporting for these distributors is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income on sales to distributors  and net income 
undelivered elements of an arrangement certain software sales include specified free upgrades and enhancements to an existing product 
revenue for such products is deferred until the future obligation is fulfilled 
service sales certain sales are made for products and related service where the fair value of the service cannot be determined 
revenues for such sales are deferred until service obligations represent the only undelivered element  at which point revenues are recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
the company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 

table of contents stock based compensation equity instruments are granted to employees  directors and consultants in certain instances  as defined in the respective plan agreements 
in   and  we issued stock options  restricted stock  and stock to our employees under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all stock based employee benefit plan equity awards granted after january  and prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award for those shares expected to vest as described below 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we continue to use the black scholes model to measure the grant date fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the grant date fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is equal to the option vesting period  which is generally three years 
the grant date fair value of espp shares that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally months  subject to modification at the date of purchase due to the espp look back feature 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock is equal to the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on the nasdaq global select market on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock that are expected to vest is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is years 
the estimate of the number of options  espp shares and restricted stock expected to vest is determined based on historical experience 
to determine the fair value of the stock options and espp shares  using the black scholes option pricing model  the calculation takes into consideration the effect of the following exercise price of the option or purchase price of the espp share  price of our common stock on the date of grant  expected term of the option or share  expected volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the option or share  and risk free interest rate during the expected term of the option or share 
the calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment 
the expected term of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considers the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
as part of our sfas r adoption  we also examined our historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations 
from this analysis  we identified three employee populations 
the expected term computation is based on historical vested option exercises and post vest forfeiture patterns and includes an estimate of the expected term for options that were fully vested and outstanding at december  for each of the three populations identified 
the estimate of the expected term for options that were fully vested and outstanding at december  was determined as the midpoint of a range of estimated expected terms determined as follows the low end of the range assumes the fully vested and outstanding options settle on december  and the high end of the range assumes that these options expire upon contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option or share 

table of contents determining the appropriate fair value model and  as noted above  calculating the fair value of equity instruments associated with our employee benefit plans require the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these equity instruments represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
derivatives during  we began to enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange risks where natural hedging strategies could not be effectively employed 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the purpose of our hedging activities are to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets  liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in general  our hedging activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose us to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large financial institutions with high credit ratings 
all derivatives  including foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas have been met  changes in the fair values of hedge contracts related to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income loss rather than net income loss until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward foreign currency exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their nature  estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
if anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions change significantly  we would reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income loss to other income expense during the quarter in which the changes occur 
we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas  however the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  revenues cost of sales cost of sales amortization of purchased technology total cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general  and administrative intangible assets amortization in process research and development charge goodwill impairment charge restructuring and other charges loss from operations interest expense interest income other income expense  net loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss comparison of year and year revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was driven by increases in revenues in the communications networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively 
revenues in the communications networking market increased in compared to primarily due to increases in next generation communication revenues from our intel mcpd acquisition  for which a full year of revenue was realized  as well increases in revenues from organic atca and media server products 
offsetting these increases  were decreased revenues from legacy enterprise products in the ip networking and messaging markets  as various legacy enterprise products approach end of life 
revenues in the commercial systems market increased slightly during as compared to  primarily due to increases within the other commercial submarket  which offset decreased revenues in the industrial automation  medical  and test and measurement submarkets 
given the dynamics of these markets  we may experience general fluctuations in the percentage of revenue attributable to each market 
as a result  the quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our markets often are not indicative of overall economic trends affecting the long term performance of our markets 
we currently expect that each of our markets will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
from a geographic perspective  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  the percentage of non us revenues by delivery destination remained relatively flat 
revenues as measured 
table of contents by destination in the asia pacific region increased by and represented of total revenues up from in revenues in the emea region increased by million in  however  as a percent of total revenues decreased to in  down from in increased revenues from both the asia pacific and emea regions were driven by the addition of asian pacific and european customer revenues resulting from our mcpd acquisition 
increased sales to nokia siemens networks further contributed to these increases 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america increased by million compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to the addition of revenues from our mcpd acquisition as well as increased revenues from the media server revenues 
we currently expect continued fluctuations in the percentage of revenue from each geographic region 
additionally  we expect non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues were and for and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increased mix of revenues from higher margin next generation communication products 
this increase was further driven by operational improvements ultimately leading to lower excess and obsolete charges as well as increased leverage of fixed costs 
research and development 
r d expenses consist primarily of salary  bonuses and benefits for product development staff  and cost of design and development supplies and equipment  net of reimbursements for non recurring engineering services 
r d expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily driven by the addition of the mcpd business  which includes increased headcount as well as stock based compensation expense 
the increase was further driven by increased incentive compensation costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreased salary and related costs resulting from the restructuring activities undertaken in the second quarter of  as well as conscious efforts to manage r d spending 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  bonuses and benefits for sales  marketing  executive  and administrative personnel  as well as professional services and costs of other general corporate activities 
sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period in is primarily due to increased incentive compensation and sales commission costs  including direct representative costs 
these increases in costs are primarily the result of increased revenue  new design wins and improved operating results 
the increase in sg a year over year was also attributable to the employee and related costs of the mcpd acquisition 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  consists of amortization of stock based compensation associated with stock options  restricted stock and espp shares unvested and outstanding on january  and new stock options  restricted stock and espp shares granted for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company incurred million in stock based compensation 
during the year ended december   we incurred million in stock based compensation expense 
we recognized stock based compensation expense as follows in thousands cost of sales research and development selling  general  and administrative total stock based compensation expense 
table of contents deferred compensation expense 
on september   all outstanding convedia stock options vested and were considered exercised immediately 
the proceeds of which were distributed as follows of the purchase price per share less the exercise price was paid to the option holder at closing and the remaining will be paid in full to those convedia employees still employed by radisys after one year of service 
the paid at the time of the acquisition is included in the purchase price and is allocated to goodwill 
the remaining is recorded as deferred compensation and amortized through the consolidated statement of operations for the life of the asset one year 
pursuant to the purchase agreement any forfeitures are reallocated to the remaining convedia employees 
we paid the remaining of the proceeds calculation on september  we recognized deferred compensation expense as follows in thousands cost of sales research and development selling  general  and administrative total deferred compensation expense intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  patents and other identifiable intangible assets 
we reclassified certain amortization in to cost of sales based on our view that the intangibles are associated with product costs and our revenue generating process 
amortization of purchased technology for prior periods is considered immaterial and has not been adjusted 
intangible assets amortization expense included in results of operations was million and million in and  respectively 
intangible assets amortization increased primarily due to the amortization of purchased technology  for which the impact of a full year was realized 
we perform reviews for impairment of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
restructuring and other charges 
we evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring and other charges on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we record certain reclassifications and reversals to the accrued restructuring and other charges based on the results of the evaluation

the costs incurred in this restructuring event are associated with employee termination benefits  including severance and medical benefits 
all restructuring activities were completed by september  in  we incurred  of employee related  net expenses 
no such charges were incurred during second quarter restructuring

in  we incurred million of employee related  net expenses 
no additional charges related to this restructuring event were incurred in the year ended december  all restructuring activities were completed by march  second quarter restructuring 
during the second quarter of  we initiated a restructuring plan that included the elimination of positions primarily initiated with the intent to return our engineering spend to 
table of contents levels which align with targeted profitability as well as refocus our skill sets in order to promote new product growth and provide enhanced service and support to existing customers 
during  we incurred  of employee related expenses as part of this restructure 
we expect to complete all activities associated with the restructuring by march  interest expense 
interest expense includes interest incurred on our convertible notes and the company s new lines of credit 
interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in interest expense in compared to was due to the issuance of million of our convertible senior notes with an interest rate of on february   along with interest charges incurred from borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  from million in to million in interest income decreased as a result of a lower average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments during compared to as well as a decline in the average yield on investment holdings 
the decline in cash  cash equivalents and investments was due to the repurchase of million and million of our and convertible notes  respectively 
there was also a decline in cash  cash equivalents and investments resulting from the acquisition of intel s mcpd business in for approximately million 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income expense  net  was  in compared to  in the increase is primarily due to net gains on the buyback of our convertible notes  which totaled  during income tax provision 
we recorded tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for the year ended was compared to for the year ended december  the company s current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of goodwill impairment  stock option expense  research and development tax credits generated in  the revaluation of certain net deferred tax assets due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and taxes on foreign income that differ from us tax rate 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of was signed into law which extended the research and development tax credit through december  congress has reinstated the tax credit retroactive to january  we have recorded federal and canadian research and development credits of approximately  and million  respectively  for the year ended at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  have been provided for deferred income tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may not be realized 
the decrease in valuation allowance of  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from the acquisition of microware in august and the expiration of a capital loss carryforward that was previously reserved 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  as of december  will be realized 
the company recognizes uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no

the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and ten foreign countries  and on occasion  we have been subject to corporate income tax audits 
in determining the amount of income tax liabilities we make estimates of the results of future examinations of our income tax returns by taxing authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided for in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may result from these examinations 
if these amounts exceed our estimates  reversal of the reserves would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period in which we determine the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
comparison of year and year revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenue during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to increases in revenues in the communications networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively

revenues in the commercial systems market increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increases within the test and measurement submarket 
the increase in revenues from the test and measurement submarket was attributable to design wins that have ramped into production in the latter half of given the dynamics of these markets  we experience general fluctuations in the percentage of revenue attributable to each market and  as a result  the quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our markets often are not indicative of overall economic trends affecting the long term performance of our markets

as of december  and working capital was million and million  respectively 
working capital increased by million due primarily to a net decrease in current liabilities that was greater than the decrease in our current assets 
the decrease in current assets was due primarily to the reclassification of our ars to long term along with a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
these decreases were offset by an increased cash balance driven by cash flow from operations totaling million 
the decrease in current liabilities resulted from the repurchase of our convertible senior notes for million and a decrease in accounts payable totaling million 
these decreases were both offset by borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
investments short term and long term investments reported as in thousands december  december  short term investments long term investments 
table of contents we currently hold investments in ars  which are highly rated debt instruments with a long term nominal maturity 
the majority of our ars represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of government backed student loans with s p aaa ratings or moody s aaa ratings at the time of purchase 
these investments had previously been classified as available for sale investments 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded  net of tax  as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
between december  and february   we sold at par value million in ars of the total ars balance of million which was held at december  during the first quarter of  due to liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  our remaining portfolio of ars experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
an auction failure  which is not a default in the underlying debt instrument  occurs when there are more sellers than buyers at a scheduled interest rate auction date and parties desiring to sell their auction rate securities are unable to do so 
when an auction fails  the interest rate is adjusted according to the provisions of the associated security agreement  which may result in an interest rate that is higher than the interest rate the issuer pays in connection with successful auctions 
we will not be able to liquidate the investments until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer  or the securities mature 
due to the uncertainty of when we will be able to liquidate the investments  we reclassified the investments to long term assets during the first quarter of and continue to hold our ars as such 
during august of  ubs ag  the parent company of the securities firm with which we hold our ars  announced an offer to its clients holding ars 
under this offer  ubs ag would issue auction rate securities rights to us 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of  we accepted the offer from ubs ag  which gave us a non transferable right to require the bank to purchase  at par value  million in ars at any time between june  and june  the agreement allows ubs ag to purchase the ars before june   but it is under no obligation to do so 
if the bank has not purchased the investments by june   we plan to exercise our non transferable right to require the purchase at that time 
in addition  under the terms of the offer  we also became eligible for a demand line of credit of up to of the market value of our ars until the time of purchase  which is described in greater detail below 
as of december   we had drawn million under the terms of this agreement 
as a result of accepting the settlement right from ubs  in accordance with our policy as well as the provisions of sfas no 
 we transferred our ars from available for sale to trading securities during the fourth quarter of  as we plan to sell them on june  at the time of transfer we recognized in earnings an unrealized holding loss in the amount of million 
the loss was based on our own estimated valuation of the ars as of december  concurrently  we recognized a gain in the amount of million  associated with the settlement right accepted from ubs 
this gain was due to the company electing the fair value option under sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities upon initial recognition of this right 
the fair value of the settlement right and ars were derived based on estimated discounted cash flows 
we considered various inputs to estimate cash flows for our ars at december   including the estimated time to allow the market for ars to recover  projected estimates of future interest income generated from the investments  as well premiums designed to account for liquidity and credit risks associated with our ars holdings 
for our non transferable right  we considered inputs such as the issuer s credit quality  expected term  and estimates of future risk free rates 
our valuation of both components of our ars are contingent upon the financial viability of our investment bank and accordingly  we have assigned a credit risk component to our valuations based on market data available at the time of valuation 
however  if market conditions change and our investment bank is unable to fulfill its commitment  we could incur an impairment charge on our settlement right  which would materially and adversely affect our operating results and overall financial condition 
additionally  the inputs used in our valuation are based on managements estimates at the time of valuation and require significant judgment 
if any of these inputs vary or market conditions change significantly  actual results may differ and our overall financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and those of high quality corporate issuers 
we attempt to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due to the short duration of most of the investment portfolios  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not necessarily have a direct impact on our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected  to any significant degree  by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities portfolio 
the estimated fair value of our interest bearing investments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the euro  british pound sterling  new shekel  japanese yen  chinese yuan  canadian dollar and malaysian ringgit 
the international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process
