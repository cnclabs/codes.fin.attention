item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein 
competition the market for primary aluminum is global  and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region 
we compete with us and international companies in the aluminum industry primarily in the areas of price  quality and service 
in addition  aluminum competes with materials such as steel  copper  carbon fiber  composites  plastic and glass  which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications 
our hawesville and ravenswood plants are each located adjacent to their largest customer 
this location allows the plants to deliver a portion of their production in molten form  at a cost savings to both parties  providing a competitive advantage over other potential suppliers 
our hawesville plant also has a competitive advantage due to its ability to produce the high purity aluminum needed by its largest customer for the manufacture of electrical transmission lines 
on february   we curtailed all operations at the ravenswood facility until economic conditions warrant the possibility of restarting

we expect any contract changes will be applied retroactively to the expiration date 
pricing our operating results are sensitive to changes in the price of primary aluminum  power and the raw materials used in its production 
as a result  we try to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in primary aluminum  power and raw material prices through the use of various fixed price commitments and financial instruments 
we offer a number of pricing alternatives to our customers which  combined with our metals risk management activities  are designed to achieve a certain level of price stability on our primary aluminum sales 
generally  we price our products at an indexed or market price  in which the customer pays an agreed upon premium over the lme price or other market indices 
grundartangi derives substantially all of its revenues from tolling arrangements whereby it converts alumina provided by its customers into primary aluminum for a fee based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
grundartangi s revenues are subject to market price risk associated with the lme price for primary aluminum  however  because its tolling revenues are based on a percentage of the lme price 
grundartangi is not directly exposed to fluctuations in the price of alumina 
grundartangi s tolling revenues include a premium based on the european union eu import duty for primary aluminum 
in may  the eu members reduced the import duty for primary aluminum from six percent to three percent and agreed to review the new duty after three years 
this decrease in the eu import duty for primary aluminum negatively impacted grundartangi s revenues and further decreases would also have a negative impact on grundartangi s revenues

item a 
risk factors the following describes certain of the risks and uncertainties we face that could cause our future results to differ materially from our current results and from those anticipated in our forward looking statements 
these risk factors should be considered together with the other risks and uncertainties described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere herein 
this list of significant risk factors is not all inclusive or necessarily in order of importance 

table of contents recent declines in aluminum prices have adversely affected our financial position and results of operations and could result in further curtailment of operations at one or more of our facilities if alternate sources of liquidity are not available or prices do not increase 
the price of primary aluminum is frequently volatile and changes in response to general economic conditions  expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories 
the recent crisis in financial and credit markets has led to a pronounced downturn in global economic activity  which is expected to be long in duration 
the global market for commodities has deteriorated in line with the decline in the global economy 
the chinese market has become a significant source of global demand for primary aluminum and now represents approximately one third of global aluminum demand 
china s demand for aluminum has more than doubled in the last five years  but demand has recently declined significantly 
declining demand for aluminum products in developed and developing nations  increasing stocks on the lme and other locations  and a general lack of confidence in future economic conditions  have combined to produce an unprecedented decline in the lme price for aluminum 
the price we realize for our products is primarily set on the lme  we have no ability to influence this price 
the lme price has fallen from its high on july   per metric ton  to february   per metric ton  with the rate of decline accelerating in the fourth quarter of this decline represents one of the most  if not the most  substantial and rapid in the history of recorded lme prices 
the average lme price for primary aluminum dropped in the second half of and  at december   was approximately lower than at december  at february   the lme price for primary aluminum was  per metric ton  or lower than at december  any decline in aluminum prices adversely affects our business  our financial position  our results of operations and our cash flows 
sustained depressed prices for aluminum would likely have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
at recent primary aluminum prices  we believe at least two thirds of global primary aluminum capacity  including all of our domestic facilities  is operating below cash breakeven 
recently  we have seen certain operating costs begin to decrease 
the pricing under our alumina contract at mt 
holly is linked to the lme price for primary aluminum  as a result  such costs have fallen 
however  other operating expenses may not decrease to any meaningful extent or  in certain cases  may even increase 
if the price we realize for our products continues to be below our cost of production  we will have to rely on other sources of liquidity to fund our operations 
if primary aluminum prices were to remain at or near recent levels for the entirety of  or were to decline further  our liquidity would be at risk 
potential other sources of liquidity could include additional issuances of equity  equity linked securities  debt issuances  prepaid aluminum sales  asset sales and sales of minority interests in our operations 
we cannot assure you that any of these financing alternatives will be available or  if available  that they will be successfully completed 
in addition  any future equity or equity linked security issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders and any future debt incurrence would increase our leverage and interest expense and would contain restrictive covenants 
we may also curtail additional operations at one or more of our facilities 
such curtailments require cash expenditures which we might not be able to fund 
there can be no assurances that in current market conditions we will be able to secure the required alternative sources of liquidity to fund our operations or to take actions necessary to curtail additional operations  if these steps are required 
a continuation or worsening of global financial and economic conditions could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
the recent global financial and credit market disruptions have reduced the availability of liquidity and credit generally 
the shortage of liquidity and credit  combined with recent substantial reductions in asset values  is likely extending and worsening the worldwide economic recession 
the general slowdown in economic activity caused by the recent domestic recession and difficult international financial and economic conditions will adversely affect our business  as the demand for primary aluminum has been reduced and the price of our products has fallen 
a continuation or worsening of the current difficult financial and economic conditions could adversely affect our customers ability to meet the terms of sale and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents our ability to access the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms to obtain funding for our operations and capital projects may be limited due to the deterioration of these markets 
our consolidated cash and short term investment balance at january  was approximately million 
this amount includes million borrowed under our revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter of and invested in highly rated short term securities 
during february  we repaid the borrowing under our revolving credit facility and completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
the net proceeds of the offering to us were approximately million  after underwriter discounts and commissions  and before offering expenses 
pro forma for the revolving credit facility repayment and the common stock offering proceeds  our cash and short term investment balance at january  would have been million 
availability under our revolving credit facility would be up to million 
this availability has been and will continue to be reduced by the reduced value of our inventory and the curtailment of operations at the ravenswood facility  which reduces the working capital constituting the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility 
for more information  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
due to the recent downturn in the financial markets  including the issues surrounding the solvency of many institutional lenders and the recent failure of several banks  we may be unable to utilize the full borrowing capacity under our credit facility if any of the committed lenders is unable or unwilling to fund their respective portion of any funding request we make under our credit facility 
in addition  the lenders under our revolving credit facility have the ability to modify the reserve criteria in the facility  which could further reduce our borrowing base 
as a result  liquidity available to us under the revolving credit facility could be reduced 
finally  our revolving credit facility will mature in september  and the holders of our million principal amount of convertible notes have an option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of these securities at par in august and to require us to settle in cash as market prices up to the principal amount of the convertible notes upon conversion  which may occur at any time 
each of these events will increase our liquidity needs 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information about our sources of liquidity 
although in the past we have generally been able to generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures and other obligations  our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements in the future could  depending upon the future price of aluminum over which we have no control and our future capital programs  require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds  including from capital and credit markets 
changes in global economic conditions  including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity  and the success of plans to manage costs  inventory and other important elements of our business  may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 
if  among other factors  primary aluminum prices were to remain on average at or around recent levels  or were to decline further  or our costs are higher than contemplated  or we suffer unexpected production outages  or icelandic laws change and limit our access to cash flow from our icelandic operations  our expectations of our liquidity would change and we would need to identify additional sources of liquidity sooner and the period of time for which we would expect our liquidity to be sufficient to fund our operations would be shorter 
current conditions have made  and will likely continue to make  it difficult to obtain new funding for our operating and capital needs  if required  from the credit and capital markets 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased  while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished and we have limited available committed financing 
also  as a result of concern about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining funding from the credit markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
an inability to access capital and credit markets could be expected to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding for our operating or capital needs will be available from the credit and capital markets if needed and to the extent required  or on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unacceptable terms  we may be unable to respond to competitive pressures or fund operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and financial position 

table of contents the recent turmoil in the financial markets could have adverse effects on our pension funding obligations 
we maintain two qualified defined benefit plans  and contribute to a third  on behalf of our employees 
as a result of poor investment returns in due to the global financial crisis  the benefit plans we maintain were underfunded as of december   and could require significant cash contributions in  further stressing our liquidity position 
if capital markets remain depressed  pension fund balances would remain reduced and additional cash contributions to the pension funds would be required 
if economic and political conditions in iceland continue to deteriorate  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
approximately one third of our existing primary aluminum production capacity is located in iceland 
in addition  our most significant new growth prospects are in iceland 
in order to operate our business and pursue our growth activities  we maintain cash management accounts in iceland with icelandic banks 
the three major icelandic banks were taken into government administration during the fourth quarter of  and  on january   iceland s prime minister and his cabinet resigned  requiring an interim government until elections scheduled to be held in may as a result of concern about the stability of the icelandic financial markets  cash management activities in iceland have become more challenging 
for example  the icelandic government and the central bank of iceland are restricting the free transfer of funds outside of iceland 
in furtherance of this  on november   the central bank of iceland adopted rules regarding the movement of foreign currency within and outside of iceland 
the rules are broad and impose many restrictions on the movement of foreign currencies outside of iceland 
by letter dated january   we were notified that our icelandic operations are exempt from these foreign currency rules 
however  we cannot control further actions by the central bank of iceland  which might restrict our ability to transfer funds through the icelandic banking system and outside of iceland 
while we currently maintain essentially all of our icelandic operating funds in accounts outside of iceland  and are receiving substantially all of our customer payments in such accounts  a portion of our funds remain in the icelandic banks to meet local working capital requirements 
in addition  as payables become due in iceland  we must transfer funds through the icelandic banking system 
the icelandic government has fully guaranteed all of the accounts in the icelandic banks and both before and after the banks were taken into government administration our transactions through the icelandic banking system have been successfully transmitted 
however  if economic and financial conditions in iceland deteriorate  or if counterparties and lenders become unwilling to engage in normal banking relations with and within iceland  our ability to pay vendors  process payroll and receive payments could be adversely impacted 
in addition  the collapse of the icelandic banking system  combined with other factors  has resulted in a significant deterioration in the general economic conditions in the country 
while our business in iceland is currently operating without significant difficulties  further impacts  if any  of these developments are uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time 
on january   the icelandic president assigned the task of forming a new government to the social democratic party 
the social democratic party led a minority government formed with the left green party 
the left green party has generally been less supportive of aluminum projects than the parties leading the prior government 
this change in icelandic government could delay or otherwise adversely affect the passage of the enabling act and approval of the investment agreement 
while we cannot predict the outcome of the upcoming elections  uncertainty or instability in the icelandic government could have an adverse effect on our business 
the market price of our common stock has declined significantly  may continue to be volatile  and may decline further 
as a result of the global economic and financial crisis and the global decline in aluminum prices  the market price of our common stock has declined significantly in recent months  and it may continue to be volatile 
from january   through february   the intra day sales price of our common stock on nasdaq ranged from to per share 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations  expectations about the future price of aluminum  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in research coverage by securities analysts  any announcement by us of significant acquisitions  curtailments  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  developments in the aluminum industry  including with respect to our major competitors  and sales of substantial numbers of shares by current holders of our common stock in the public market 
in addition  general economic  political and market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile 
we cannot predict the price at which our common stock will trade in the future  and it may continue to decline 
as a result  holders of our stock may not be able to sell it when they want  at prices they want or at all 

table of contents our planned construction and development activities require substantial capital 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all  which could delay or curtail our planned construction projects 
in light of current global financial and economic conditions  we are reviewing our capital plans and reducing  stopping or deferring all non critical capital expenditures in our existing smelters 
we have made and continue making modest capital expenditures for the construction and development of our new helguvik smelter project 
in  we expended approximately million in capital expenditures for the helguvik greenfield project  and  from inception through december   we expended approximately million for helguvik 
we are currently evaluating the helguvik project s cost  scope and schedule in light of the global economic crisis and weakening commodity prices 
during this evaluation process  we have significantly reduced spending on the project  we expect that capital expenditures on this project during will be in the range of to million until and unless a decision is made to restart major construction and engineering activities 
this amount includes approximately million for deferred payments to suppliers 
see construction at our helguvik smelter site is under review below 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures from available cash  our cash flow from operations and from future capital raising 
we may be unable to raise additional capital  or do so on attractive terms  due to a number of factors including a lack of demand  poor economic conditions  unfavorable interest rates or our financial condition or credit rating at the time 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economy may adversely affect our liquidity  our ability to access the capital markets and our financial condition 
if additional capital resources are unavailable  we may further curtail construction and development activities 
construction at our helguvik smelter site is under review 
we are currently evaluating the helguvik project s cost  scope and schedule in light of the global economic crisis and weakening commodity prices 
during this evaluation process  we have significantly reduced spending on the project 
we cannot be certain when or if we will restart major construction and engineering activities or ultimately complete the helguvik project or  if completed  that the helguvik smelter would operate in a profitable manner 
we will not realize any return on our significant investment in the helguvik project until we are able to commence helguvik operations in a profitable manner 
if we fail to achieve operations  we may have to recognize a loss on our investment  and a loss of our investment would have a negative impact on our future earnings 
if we decide to proceed  this project is subject to various contractual approvals and conditions 
there can be no assurance that we will receive the necessary approvals to proceed with construction of our helguvik smelter  on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  such approvals as we do receive may be subject to conditions that are unfavorable or make the project impracticable or less attractive from a financial standpoint 
even if we receive necessary approvals on terms that we determine are acceptable  the construction of this project is a complex undertaking 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the project within our projected budget and schedule 
to successfully execute this project  we will also need to arrange additional financing and either enter into tolling arrangements or secure a supply of alumina 
in addition  unforeseen technical difficulties could increase the cost of the project  delay the project or render the project not feasible 
any delay in the completion of the project or increased costs could have a material negative impact on our financial performance and future prospects 
we may be required to write down the value of certain assets 
we are required to perform various analyses related to the carrying value of various tangible and intangible assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that their net carrying amount may not be recoverable 
given the current lack of profitability of certain of our production facilities and  more generally  global economic conditions  which in part drive assumptions for the future in such analyses  we could have significant adjustments in the carrying value for certain assets 
in december  we determined an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of a portion of our long lived assets was not currently required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we will continue to evaluate these assets as long as events or circumstances indicate that their net carrying amount may not be recoverable and we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
we recorded a million impairment charge to eliminate the carrying value of our goodwill relating to the acquisition of nordural in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we also recorded a million valuation allowance against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets based upon our best estimate of our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets 
management will continue to evaluate our tangible and intangible assets for impairments and valuation allowance  which could be significant 
any such adjustments would be in the form of a non cash charge which would reduce our earnings and reduce our balance of retained earnings 

table of contents our credit ratings have been recently changed by two major credit rating agencies 
two major credit rating agencies have recently changed the status of our ratings on a general basis and on our specific debt securities 
on january   standard poor s removed their creditwatch and downgraded our credit rating to b with a negative outlook from bb 
standard poor s has stated that the downgrade reflects their expectation that operating results will deteriorate over the next several quarters due to continued low aluminum prices that are unlikely to show significant improvement until general economic activity picks up globally and high inventory levels are reduced 
according to standard poor s  an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb  but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
standard poor s also notes that adverse business  financial  or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
on december   moody s investors service downgraded our credit rating to b from ba and kept our ratings under review for further possible downgrade 
moody s has stated the b corporate family rating reflects moody s expectation that earnings and cash flow will be pressured by the impact of substantially lower aluminum prices on our higher cost us operations 
according to moody s  obligations rated b are considered speculative and subject to high credit risk 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
these recent actions by standard poor s and moody s  and any further actions the credit rating agencies may take  could negatively impact our ability to access liquidity in the credit and capital markets in the future and could lead to worsened trade terms  increasing our liquidity needs 
the cyclical nature of the aluminum industry causes variability in our earnings and cash flows 
our operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum  which is a highly cyclical commodity with prices that are affected by global demand and supply factors and other conditions 
historically  aluminum prices have been volatile  and we expect such volatility to continue 
currently  we are experiencing unfavorable global economic conditions and a substantial decline in worldwide demand for primary aluminum 
declines in primary aluminum prices reduce our earnings and cash flows 
this downturn in aluminum prices has significantly reduced the amount of cash available to meet our current obligations and fund our long term business strategies 
our molten aluminum sales at ravenswood and hawesville are subject to sales contracts which limit our ability to cut costs and create dependence on two major customers 
we have contracts with alcan and southwire which are due to expire in august and march  respectively 
these contracts obligate us to deliver required quantities of aluminum which limit our ability to cut costs by curtailing operations 
in addition  our contract with southwire requires us to deliver molten metal 
curtailing operations at these facilities does not relieve us of our contractual obligations 
we will continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet our contractual obligations  including potentially securing other aluminum to satisfy our obligations 

table of contents in addition  when lme prices improve  the loss of southwire as a customer could increase our production costs at hawesville and increase our sales and marketing costs 
approximately of our consolidated net sales for were derived from sales to southwire 
southwire s facility is located adjacent to hawesville 
due to this proximity  we are able to deliver molten aluminum to this customer  thereby eliminating our casting and shipping costs and our customer s freight and remelting costs and reducing our sales and marketing costs 
we may be unable to extend or replace our contract with southwire when it terminates 
if we are unable to renew this contract when it expires or if southwire significantly reduces its purchases under this contract  we would incur higher casting and shipping costs and potentially higher sales and marketing costs 
hawesville is not currently qualified to sell metal directly to the lme  if it were required to make sales outside of the southwire long term contract prior to us receiving this qualification  these sales would likely require the services of third party agents which would require us to incur additional costs 
there can be no assurance that our current initiatives to qualify hawesville will be successful 
we will be required to incur substantial costs in order to curtail unprofitable aluminum production 
none of our us smelting capacity is profitable on a cash basis at recent primary aluminum prices  and we are currently assessing cost reduction actions  including the further curtailment of production at unprofitable facilities  in light of these unfavorable economic conditions 
we have curtailed our operations at ravenswood and additional operations at our facilities could be curtailed unless the lme selling price for aluminum stabilizes and we are able to materially reduce costs and stem monthly losses 
curtailing unprofitable production in order to reduce our operating costs will require us to incur substantial expense  both at the time of the curtailment and ongoing 
these facilities are subject to contractual and other fixed costs that will continue even if we curtail operations at these facilities 
these costs will reduce the cost saving advantages of curtailing unprofitable aluminum production 
in addition  the prospect of these costs limits our flexibility to curtail all of our unprofitable production 
in addition to these costs  our joint ownership of certain of our operations limits our ability to curtail these operations 
losses caused by disruptions in the supply of power would reduce the profitability of our operations 
we use large amounts of electricity to produce primary aluminum 
any loss of power which reduces the amperage to our equipment or causes an equipment shutdown would result in a reduction in the volume of molten aluminum produced  and sudden losses of power may result in the hardening or freezing of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced 
interruptions in the supply of electrical power to our facilities can be caused by a number of circumstances  including unusually high demand  blackouts  equipment failure  natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
if such a condition were to occur  we may lose production for a prolonged period of time and incur significant losses 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events  but are required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies 
in addition  the coverage under those policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses  or may not cover certain events 
certain of our insurance policies do not cover any losses that may be incurred if our suppliers are unable to provide power during periods of unusually high demand 
certain losses or prolonged interruptions in our operations may trigger a default under our revolving credit facility 
the cost of alumina used at hawesville may be higher than under our lme based alumina contracts 
we acquire alumina used at ravenswood and mt 
holly at prices based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
gramercy supplies substantially all of the alumina used at hawesville at prices based on gramercy s production costs 
those production costs are materially higher than the price paid under lme based contracts during periods  such as exist at the present time  when aluminum prices are low 

table of contents changes or disruptions to our current alumina and other raw material supply arrangements could increase our raw material costs 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for alumina 
disruptions to our supply of alumina could occur for a variety of reasons  including disruptions of production at a particular supplier s alumina refinery 
these disruptions may require us to purchase alumina on the spot market on less favorable terms than under our current agreements 
gramercy supplies substantially all the alumina used at hawesville 
our joint venture bauxite mining operation in st 
ann  jamaica  supplies all of the bauxite used in the production of alumina at gramercy 
if there is a significant disruption of st 
ann bauxite shipments in the future  gramercy could incur additional costs if it is required to use bauxite from other sources 
our business also depends upon the adequate supply of other raw materials  including caustic soda  aluminum fluoride  calcined petroleum coke  pitch  finished carbon anodes and cathodes  at competitive prices 
although there remain multiple sources for these raw materials worldwide  consolidation among suppliers has globally reduced the number of available suppliers in this industry 
a disruption in our raw materials supply from our existing suppliers due to a labor dispute  shortage of their raw materials or other unforeseen factors may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to secure alternate supplies of these materials at comparable prices 
our contracts for alumina require us to take or pay for fixed quantities of alumina  even if we curtail unprofitable production capacity 
we have contractual obligations under our existing alumina purchase contracts to take or pay for specified quantities of alumina over the term of those contracts  regardless of our operating requirements 
we have an alumina contract with glencore to supply ravenswood through december we also have entered into a follow on long term alumina contract with glencore to provide for our future alumina requirements for ravenswood and  potentially  our helguvik project 
deliveries under that contract will begin in january and continue through in february  we curtailed operations at our ravenswood facility  in addition our helguvik project is under review 
we cannot be certain when or if we will restart major construction and engineering activities or ultimately complete the helguvik project 
see the risk factor construction at our helguvik smelter site is under review above for additional information about this project 
curtailing operations does not relieve us of our contractual obligations 
we will continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet or settle our contractual obligations 
if we are unable to use the contracted alumina in our other operations or sell the alumina at prices consistent with our contract costs  we could incur significant losses under these contracts 
as a result of the ravenswood curtailment  we expect to incur cash losses of approximately to million in associated with the sale of excess alumina that will be received under our alumina supply agreement that expires december  this estimate is based on current alumina contract pricing which is indexed to lme prices for primary aluminum  our estimate of spot alumina prices and the forecasted internal use of a portion of this material in our other smelting operations 
changes in the relative cost and availability of certain raw materials and energy compared to the price of primary aluminum could affect our operating results 
our operating results vary significantly with changes in the price of primary aluminum and the raw materials used in its production  including alumina  caustic soda  aluminum fluoride  calcined petroleum coke  pitch  finished carbon anodes and cathodes 
because we sell our products based on the lme price for primary aluminum  we cannot pass on increased costs to our customers 
although we attempt to mitigate the effects of price fluctuations through the use of various fixed price commitments and financial instruments and by pricing some of our raw materials and energy contracts based on lme prices  these efforts also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for primary aluminum or raw materials 
electricity represents our single largest operating cost 
as a result  the availability of electricity at economic prices is critical to the profitability of our operations 
we purchase a significant portion of our electricity for our us facilities under fixed price contracts 
portions of the contracted cost of the electricity supplied to mt 
holly vary with the supplier s fuel costs 
an increase in these fuel costs would increase the price this facility pays for electricity 
costs under this contract have substantially increased in recent years  and this trend appears to be continuing into approximately of hawesville s power requirements are supplied under a fixed price contract 
as a result  hawesville is subject to market based pricing for approximately of its power requirements 
the profitability of hawesville is affected by the market price for electric power 
we are working with a local power company on a proposal that would restructure and extend hawesville s existing power supply contract through this agreement is expected to close in the second quarter of and is subject to contractual conditions  which include obtaining the approvals of federal and state regulatory agencies 
we cannot assure whether or when the closing will occur 
if we are not successful in replacing such power requirements  we may be forced to curtail or idle a portion of our production capacity  which would lower our revenues and adversely affect the profitability of our operations when the price of primary aluminum is high 
if we are successful in restructuring the contract for the power supply at hawesville  the new rate we will pay  which will be based on the supplier s cost of production  could be higher than the price we currently pay under our current fixed price contract  which could increase hawesville s production costs 

table of contents unexpected events  including natural disasters  may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations 
unexpected events  including fires or explosions at our facilities  natural disasters  such as hurricanes  unplanned power outages  supply disruptions  or equipment failures  may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise disrupt our operations 
we are subject to the risk of union disputes 
the bargaining unit employees at ravenswood and hawesville and gramercy are represented by the uswa 
century s uswa labor contracts at ravenswood and hawesville and the labor contract at gramercy expire in may  march and september  respectively 
our bargaining unit employees at grundartangi are represented by five unions under a collective bargaining agreement that expires on december  if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with any labor union representing our employees  our labor contracts may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of these facilities in the future 
any threatened or actual work stoppage in the future could prevent or significantly impair our ability to conduct production operations at our unionized facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could result in costs or liabilities 
we are obligated to comply with various federal  state and other environmental laws and regulations  including the environmental laws and regulations of the united states  iceland  the eu and jamaica 
environmental laws and regulations may expose us to costs or liabilities relating to our manufacturing operations or property ownership 
we incur operating costs and capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  we are currently and may in the future be responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former facilities or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources 
we  along with others  including current and former owners of a facility on st 
croix in the virgin islands  formerly owned by a subsidiary of ours  have been sued for alleged natural resources damages at the facility 
in addition  in december  century and the company that purchased the assets of our st 
croix facility in were sued by the commissioner of the us virgin islands department of planning and natural resources  alleging our failure to take certain actions specified in a virgin islands coastal zone management permit issued to our subsidiary  virgin island alumina corporation llc  in october in july  century was named as a defendant together with certain affiliates of alcan inc in a lawsuit brought by alcoa inc seeking to determine responsibility for certain environmental indemnity obligations related to the sale of a cast aluminum plate manufacturing facility located in vernon  california  which we purchased from alcoa inc in december  and sold to alcan rolled products ravenswood llc in july our known liabilities with respect to these and other matters relating to environmental compliance and cleanup  based on current information  are not expected to be material 
if more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed  previously unknown environmental conditions or damages to natural resources are discovered or alleged  or if contributions from other responsible parties with respect to sites for which we have cleanup responsibilities are not available  we may be subject to additional liability  which may be material and could affect our liquidity and our operating results 
further  additional environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known  with respect to sites previously owned or operated by us  by related corporate entities or by our predecessors  or at sites that we may acquire in the future 
in addition  overall production costs may become prohibitively expensive and prevent us from effectively competing in price sensitive markets if future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance or cleanup are significantly greater than current or projected expenditures and costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding our environmental matters and associated costs and risks 

table of contents acquisitions may present difficulties 
we have a history of making acquisitions and we expect to make acquisitions in the future based on several factors  including if primary aluminum prices in the global market improve 
we are subject to numerous risks as a result of our acquisition strategy  including the following we may spend time and money pursuing target acquisitions that do not close  acquired companies may have contingent or hidden liabilities  it may be challenging for us to manage our existing business as we integrate acquired operations  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  and management of acquisitions will require continued development of financial controls and information systems  which may prove to be expensive  time consuming  and difficult to maintain 
accordingly  our past or future acquisitions might not ultimately improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated 
international operations expose us to political  regulatory  currency and other related risks 
grundartangi was our first facility located outside of the united states  and it represents approximately of our overall primary aluminum production capacity 
in addition  we have begun to construct an aluminum smelter near helguvik  iceland 
the st 
ann bauxite operations related to gramercy are located in jamaica 
in april  we purchased of baise haohai carbon co  ltd  a carbon anode and cathode facility located in the guangxi zhuang autonomous region of south china 
international operations expose us to risks  including unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations  political and economic instability  challenges in managing foreign operations  increased cost to adapt our systems and practices to those used in foreign countries  export duties  tariffs and other trade barriers  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in addition  we may be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and  as a result  an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could increase our operating expenses which are denominated and payable in those currencies 
grundartangi s revenues are denominated in us dollars  while its labor costs are denominated in isk and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in euros 
economic  financial and political conditions in iceland have deteriorated significantly 
see if economic and political conditions in iceland continue to deteriorate  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
and construction at our helguvik smelter site is under review above for more information 
as we continue to explore other opportunities outside the us  including the helguvik facility  our currency risk with respect to the isk and other foreign currencies will significantly increase 
our historical financial information may not be comparable to our results for future periods 
our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
for example  certain of our historical financial data do not reflect the effects of the  mtpy expansion capacity of grundartangi that was completed in the fourth quarter of  the  mtpy expansion capacity of grundartangi that was completed in the fourth quarter of  and  our results for also do not reflect the february curtailment of ravenswood s remaining three potlines 

table of contents our level of indebtedness requires significant cash flow to meet our debt service requirements  which reduces cash available for other purposes  such as the payment of dividends  and limits our ability to pursue our growth opportunities 
we had an aggregate of approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  including million borrowed under our revolving credit facility  as of december  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting cash flow available for capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  working capital and other general corporate purposes because a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to servicing our debt  and  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  competitive and other changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
we have various obligations to make payments in cash that will reduce the amount of cash we have to service the interest on our outstanding debt and for other uses 
we will be required to settle in cash at market prices up to the principal amount of our million principal amount of convertible notes which are convertible at market value by the holder at any time upon conversion  which could increase our debt service obligations 
in august  the holders of these convertible notes have an option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of these securities at par 
in addition to our indebtedness  we have liabilities and other obligations which could reduce cash available for other purposes and could limit our ability to pursue our growth opportunities 
we are also exposed to risks of interest rate increases 
our industrial revenue bonds irbs and any borrowings on our credit facility are at variable interest rates 
future borrowing required to fund working capital at grundartangi or the construction of the helguvik facility may be at variable rates 
an increase in interest rates would increase our debt service obligations under these instruments  further limiting cash flow available for other uses 
our ability to pay interest and to repay or refinance our indebtedness  including our senior unsecured notes and convertible notes and to satisfy other commitments  will depend upon our future operating performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  including market prices for primary aluminum  that are beyond our control  and access to additional sources of liquidity 
accordingly  there is no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we could attempt to restructure or refinance our indebtedness or seek additional equity or debt capital 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish those actions on satisfactory terms or at all 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes limit our ability to incur additional debt and pursue our growth strategy 
our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes each contain various covenants that restrict the way we conduct our business and limit our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and engage in transactions such as acquisitions and investments  among other things  which may impair our ability to obtain additional liquidity and pursue our growth strategy 
any failure to comply with those covenants would likely constitute a breach under the revolving credit facility or the indenture governing the notes  which may result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness and termination of commitments under our revolving credit facility 
if our indebtedness is accelerated  we may be unable to repay the required amounts and our secured lenders could foreclose on any collateral securing our secured debt 

table of contents further consolidation within the metals industry could provide competitive advantages to our competitors 
the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be more consolidation transactions in the future 
consolidation by our competitors may enhance their capacity and their access to resources  lower their cost structure and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
continued consolidation may limit our ability to implement our strategic objectives effectively 
we cannot reliably predict the impact on us of further consolidation in the metals industry 
if we are unable to procure a reliable source of power  the helguvik project would not be feasible 
our greenfield smelter near helguvik  iceland  will require generation and transmission of geothermally generated electricity to power the smelter 
our wholly owned iceland subsidiary  nordural helguvik ehf  has entered into agreements with two providers of geothermal power in iceland for a substantial portion of this power 
these two power company agreements are subject to certain conditions  some of which are not expected to be satisfied until june these conditions include approvals by the boards of directors of the power companies  as well as environmental agency approvals for the power producing assets 
generation of the electrical power contracted for the helguvik smelter will require successful development of new geothermal energy sources within designated areas in iceland 
if there are construction delays or technical difficulties in developing these new geothermal fields  power may be delayed or may not be available 
factors which could delay or impede the generation and delivery of electric power are substantially beyond our ability to control  influence or predict 
in october  nordural signed a transmission agreement with landsnet to provide an electrical power transmission system to the helguvik smelter 
if we are unable to proceed with the project  we would have to reimburse landsnet for certain expenditures under this agreement 
reductions in the duty on primary aluminum imports into the european union decrease our revenues at grundartangi 
grundartangi s tolling revenues include a premium based on the eu import duty for primary aluminum 
in may  the eu members reduced the import duty for primary aluminum from six percent to three percent and agreed to review the new duty after three years 
this decrease in the eu import duty for primary aluminum negatively impacts grundartangi s revenues and further decreases would also have a negative impact on grundartangi s revenues 
we depend upon intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations 
we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon the receipt of intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries 
subject to the restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior and convertible notes  future borrowings by our subsidiaries could contain restrictions or prohibitions on the intercompany transfers by those subsidiaries 
in addition  under applicable law  our subsidiaries could be limited in the amounts that they are permitted to pay as dividends on their capital stock 
for example  the icelandic government and the central bank of iceland are restricting the free transfer of funds outside of iceland 
in furtherance of this  on november   the central bank of iceland adopted rules regarding the movement of foreign currency within and outside of iceland 
the rules are broad and impose many restrictions on the movement of foreign currencies outside of iceland 
by letter dated january   we were notified that our icelandic operations are exempt from these foreign currency rules 
however  we cannot control further actions by the central bank of iceland  which might restrict our ability to transfer funds through the icelandic banking system and outside of iceland 

table of contents provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it difficult for others to obtain control of century aluminum  even though some stockholders may consider them to be beneficial 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of century  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise have received a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices 
for example  these provisions give authority to our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any stockholder vote  provide  under our charter documents  for a board of directors consisting of three classes  each of which serves for a different three year term  require stockholders to give advance notice prior to submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings or to nominate persons for election as directors  and restrict  under our charter documents  certain business combinations between us and any person who beneficially owns or more of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  several of our officers have entered into employment and severance compensation agreements that provide for cash payments  immediate vesting of stock options and performance shares and acceleration of other benefits under certain circumstances  including a change in control of century 
our stock incentive plan  as amended  also provides for acceleration of the ability to exercise stock options and the vesting of performance shares upon a change in control  and our non employee directors stock option plan provides for acceleration of an option holder s ability to exercise stock options upon a change in control 
our relationship with glencore may also deter a takeover 
as of february   we believe that glencore beneficially owned  through common stock and preferred stock ownership  approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock and an overall economic ownership of century 
in addition  we have extensive commercial dealings with glencore 
we have agreed with glencore that if we make a widely distributed public offering for cash and glencore is not permitted to maintain its economic ownership of us at in such offering  glencore can purchase in the open market enough voting securities to maintain its economic ownership interest of us 
under the terms of our standstill and governance agreement  glencore agreed that through april   glencore may not vote more than of our common stock  nor  subject to certain limited exceptions  acquire more than of our voting securities 
any voting securities held by glencore in excess of until april   will be voted by our board of directors 
upon glencore s participation in our january equity offering  we entered into an agreement with glencore to amend the terms of our standstill and governance agreement to increase the percentage of our voting securities that glencore may acquire prior to april  and to allow glencore to exercise voting rights with respect to any shares of our common stock it purchased in the january offering 
as a result  currently until april  glencore has voting rights with respect to approximately of the outstanding voting securities and thereafter would voting rights with respect to approximately of our outstanding voting securities 
see note shareholders equity preferred stock series a convertible preferred stock in the consolidated financial statements included herein 
subject to certain limited exceptions  from april  to january   glencore may not acquire more than of our voting securities 
glencore also has agreed to forego or restrict certain actions  including unsolicited business combination proposals  tender offers  proxy contests and sales of its common and preferred shares for a limited period of time 
these limitations on glencore s ability to acquire voting securities and seek control of century could deter a takeover by glencore 
glencore s substantial ownership interest in us and our other commercial dealings with glencore could have the effect of deterring a takeover bid by a third party
