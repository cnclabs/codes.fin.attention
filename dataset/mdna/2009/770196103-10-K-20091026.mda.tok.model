item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the energy  industrial  chemical and pharmaceutical markets worldwide 
we attribute our success to our close and continuing interaction with customers  our manufacturing  sourcing and application engineering expertise and our ability to serve customers globally 
we attempt to continually develop initiatives to improve our performance in these key areas 
in fiscal  demand for our products slowed due to lower oil and natural gas prices as well as the worldwide economic downturn which affected the operating results in each of our segments 
we have responded to these business conditions by cutting costs and initiating restructuring programs which are intended to reduce manufacturing capacity  standardize product offerings to allow greater utilization of our lower cost manufacturing facilities  leverage functional resources  and further integrate our business activities 
we expect to continue our restructuring efforts in fiscal to improve our competitiveness and long term profitability 
with approximately of our sales outside the united states  we were also unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation in fiscal due to the us dollar strengthening relative to our other principal operating currencies 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  with related gains or losses reported as a separate component of our shareholders equity 
the devaluation of most foreign currencies against the us dollar impacted our financial condition at the end of fiscal as compared with fiscal our business consists of three market focused segments fluid management  process solutions and romaco 
fluid management 
energy and industrial markets served by our fluid management segment began slowing in january our primary objectives for this segment are to expand our geographic reach  introduce new products  develop new customer relationships  and more tightly integrate our operations 
our fluid management business segment designs  manufactures and markets equipment and systems  including hydraulic drilling power sections  down hole and industrial progressing cavity pumps  wellhead systems  grinders  rod guides  tubing rotators and pipeline closures  used in oil and gas exploration and recovery  specialty chemical  wastewater treatment and a variety of other industrial applications 
process solutions 
key end markets served by our process solutions segment  chemical and pharmaceutical  began slowing in october our primary objectives are to improve productivity through integration of operations and process improvements  to leverage our lower cost locations and to increase our focus on aftermarket opportunities 
our process solutions business segment designs  manufactures and services glass lined reactors and storage vessels  standard and customized fluid agitation equipment and systems and customized fluoropolymer lined fittings  vessels and accessories  primarily for the pharmaceutical and specialty chemical markets 
romaco 
our customer base within the key markets  including pharmaceutical  cosmetics and healthcare  served by the romaco segment  has been expanding in the developing areas of the world  although these markets also slowed in fiscal our primary objectives are to maintain our simplified business model  further develop our global distribution capabilities  and increase our focus on aftermarket opportunities 
our romaco business segment designs  manufactures and markets packaging and secondary processing equipment for the pharmaceutical  healthcare  nutriceutical and cosmetic industries 
packaging applications include dosing  filling and sealing of vials  capsules  tubes  bottles and blisters  tablet counting and packaging for bottles  blister and powder packaging for various products including tablets and powder  customized packaging  as well as secondary processing for sauces and semi solids

in addition  the comparability of the segment data is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  due to the translation of non us dollar denominated subsidiary results into non us dollars 
the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures 
one of those measures  ebit  is income before interest  income taxes and minority interest and is reconciled to net income on our consolidated statement of income 
we evaluate performance of our business segments and allocate resources based on ebit 
ebit is not  however  a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating results 
ebit is not a measure of cash available for use by management

this increase is largely attributable to a stronger global chemical market and increased asia region sales 
excluding currency and acquisition impacts  orders increased by million  or over prior year  primarily driven by projects in the chemical market and activity in the asian region 
ending backlog of million is higher than prior year levels 
the organic increase in sales  orders and backlog reflects the strong demand in the chemical market and an increased expansion in the developing areas of the world

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operating activities was million compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
this decrease resulted primarily from lower net income  customer deposits and reductions in amounts owed to suppliers  partly offset by lower customer accounts receivable 
we expect our available cash  fiscal operating cash flow and amounts available under our credit agreement to be adequate to fund fiscal year operating needs  shareholder dividends  capital expenditures  repayment of our million senior notes and additional share repurchases  if any 
investing activities in  the company continued to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  a decrease from million in fiscal our capital expenditures were primarily for capacity expansion projects in the fluid management segment which were initiated in fiscal  support for cost reduction initiatives and replacement items 
capital expenditures in fiscal are not expected to be materially higher than fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased the remaining percent minority interest in one of our process solutions group asian subsidiaries for million  which we paid from available cash resources 
we made an acquisition in our process solutions segment in for a total consideration of million 
in fiscal we received proceeds of million related to the sale of two of our romaco product lines sold in fiscal and the sale of two facilities

we are not dependent on any single bank for our financing needs 
from available cash balances  we repaid million of our senior notes on the may  due date 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
in instances where we have equipment installation obligations  the revenue related to the installation service is deferred until installation is complete 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method because we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty  litigation  product liability  tax contingencies  stock option valuation  goodwill valuation and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
the inventory to which this reserve relates is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore  there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income  reversals of temporary differences  available carryback periods  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service and delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation and product liability reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated at our reporting unit level  were performed at year end for fiscal our annual impairment test date using a discounted cash flow methodology income approach 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are 
table of contents based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
the impairment testing performed by the company at august  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  and  as such  no impairment existed 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests would be reflected in income before interest  income taxes and minority interest in our consolidated statement of income 
other intangibles are evaluated periodically if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in plan discount rates and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension expense 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for a funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in plan assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
at august   the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets was 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at august   the weighted average discount rate used to value plan liabilities was 
we determine our discount rate based on an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to fiscal specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by million  and a comparable decrease in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our non us dollar net asset positions 
under certain conditions  we may enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros  swiss francs and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit for fiscal would have decreased by million and our cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices
