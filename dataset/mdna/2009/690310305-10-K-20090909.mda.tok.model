see the business section in part i  item of this report for more information about our business  products and operations 
overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial position and operating performance 
generation of revenue 
we generate the vast majority of our revenue from sales of our data protection appliances 
the balance of our revenue is provided by selling spare parts  selling maintenance contracts and rendering related services  and earning royalties on our licensed technology 
historically  the majority of our sales have been generated through private label arrangements with original equipment manufacturers oems  and the remainder has been made through our branded channel  which includes commercial distributors  direct market resellers dmrs and value added resellers vars 
however  our strategy for the past three years has been to focus more on sales of new and expanded products to our branded channel  which historically has produced higher gross margins in comparison to oem business 
declining sales to hewlett packard hp 
in august  we announced that our largest oem customer  hp  had selected an alternate supplier for its next generation mid range tape automation products 
hp began purchasing the first product of this new line from the alternate supplier during the first quarter of calendar year  which decreased our sales to hp 
however  in mid hp re launched its tape automation products supplied by us with support for hp s new lto tape drives  which slowed the rate of replacement of our supplied products by the alternate supplier s product 
although we believe that our sales to hp will continue to decline  we recently extended our supply agreement with hp until july with automatic renewals for three successive one year periods unless earlier terminated 
revenue from hp in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal  and decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal recent setbacks 
during fiscal  we experienced lower than anticipated revenue 
we believe customers have delayed purchases for a number of reasons  including i the uncertainty of the world economy and a general decrease in information technology it spending  and ii a reluctance to purchase our products due to uncertainty regarding our financial condition 
due in large part to the overall decline in hp revenue  we reported net revenue of million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decline in net revenue resulted in a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal positive trends 
during fiscal  we have achieved a number of financial and operational objectives designed to further our efforts to regain profitability operating expenses in fiscal continued to decrease compared with fiscal and fiscal due to the completion of a number of material intensive development projects and continued efforts to reduce costs 
operating expenses for fiscal  and were million  million including a million impairment charge on long lived assets and million  respectively 
general and administrative g a expense leveled off in fiscal through efforts to reduce costs 
g a expense totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development r d expense was relatively unchanged at million  compared with million in fiscal including the million charge in the second quarter of fiscal for software code 
r d expense was million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributed to reductions in marketing programs and reductions in headcount for sales and marketing departments 
during fiscal  we increased inventory turns while decreasing inventory levels 
we continue to target lower inventory levels and higher inventory turns 
service revenue  including service revenue from snap server products  increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal and million for fiscal in addition  margins for service revenue increased to for fiscal  compared with for fiscal and for fiscal during fiscal  snap server net revenue was million 
in june  we acquired the snap server network attached storage nas business from adaptec  inc the snap server product line broadens our capabilities by adding distributed nas while also strengthening central and remote office data protection 
liquidity and capital resources 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
however  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million and the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined by million 
at june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at june  we have no unused source of liquidity at this time 
cash management and preservation continues to be a top priority 
we expect to incur negative operating cash flows during the remainder of calendar as we continue to revamp our business and introduce and market our new products 
management has projected that cash on hand  along with funding available under our non oem accounts receivable financing agreements  will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations at current levels through fiscal however  a shortfall from projected sales levels and a consequent decrease in eligible non oem receivables or a change to the historical timing of receivables could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access the necessary level of funding to continue operations at current levels 
in the event this was to happen  we would be forced to further extend payment terms with suppliers where possible  to liquidate certain assets where possible  and or to suspend or curtail certain of our planned programs 
any of these actions could harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
to guard against this risk  we intend to seek debt  equity or equity based financing such as convertible debt when market conditions improve 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  or securities convertible into shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our existing shareholders may be diluted 
the amount of dilution could be increased by the issuance of warrants or securities with other dilutive characteristics  such as anti dilution clauses or price resets 
if we need additional funding for operations and we are unable to raise it  we may be forced to liquidate assets and or curtail or cease operations 
as of june   we had negative working capital of million  primarily reflecting a million decrease in current assets and a million increase in current liabilities 
the decrease in current assets is primarily attributable to reduced sales and inventory 
the increase in current liabilities is primarily attributable to the non oem accounts receivable financing arrangements we entered into during fiscal to help us manage our cash 
current liabilities associated with these arrangements  including accrued interest  totaled million as of june  see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of these arrangements 
as of june   our other assets included million of auction rate securities ars that have a par value of million 
the auctions for these securities have failed since july  which limits our ability to liquidate these securities and recover their carrying value in the near term 
we may nonetheless attempt to liquidate these securities to meet cash needs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to liquidate these securities  and we expect that any liquidation in the near term may bring less than the carrying value of these securities as of june  due to the lack of a market for these securities 
industry trends 
magnetic tape has been used for all forms of data backup and recovery because magnetic tape was  and still is  the most cost effective  removable  high capacity storage media that can be taken off site to ensure that data is safeguarded in case of disaster 
we have a market leading position in mid range tape automation with our flagship neo products 
sales of tape automation appliances represented more than of our annual revenue for fiscal years through sales of tape automation appliances represented of our revenue during fiscal although we expect that tape solutions will continue to be the foundation of the data protection strategy at most companies  tape backup is time consuming and often unreliable and inefficient 
the process of recovering data from tape is also time consuming and inefficient 
we expect that tape will continue to be relegated to an archival role for less frequently accessed data  and companies will increasingly focus more on disk based solutions 
recent developments on july   we launched our new reo business continuity application bca 
the reo bca provides enterprise level backup  replication and recovery functionality to small and medium enterprises smes 
on july   we announced that we appointed jillian mansolf as our vice president of worldwide sales and marketing 
on july   ravi pendekanti  became vice president of business development and solutions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  available for sale securities  share based compensation  bad debts  inventories  intangible and other long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes and restructuring charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies and estimates that require the most significant judgment are discussed further below 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
under this policy  revenue on direct product sales excluding sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment of products to our customers 
these customers are not entitled to any specific right of return or price protection  except for any defective product that may be returned under our warranty policy 
generally  title and risk of loss transfer to the customer when the product leaves our dock 
product sales to distribution customers are subject to certain rights of return  stock rotation privileges and price protection 
because we are unable to estimate our exposure for returned product or price adjustments  revenue from shipments to these customers is not recognized until the related products are in turn sold to the ultimate customer by the distributor 
for products in which software is more than incidental  we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition fasb asc 
when there are multiple elements in an arrangement  we allocate revenue to the separate elements based on relative fair value  provided we have fair value for all elements of the arrangement 
if in an arrangement we have fair value for undelivered elements but not the delivered element  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element s and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered element s 
undelivered elements typically include services 
revenue from extended warranty and product service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
we have various royalty arrangements with independent service providers that sell our product and also sell and provide service on our product 
these independent service providers pay a royalty fee for service contracts in place on our product 
the royalty fee is calculated by us for the units covered in the quarter  and agreed to by the service provider  based upon the monthly fee for each unit covered by the independent service provider 
in addition  we receive royalties from hp for licensing of our protection os software 
revenue is recognized based upon quarterly reporting from hp of the number of units sold 
we have various licensing agreements relating to our variable rate randomizer vr technology with third parties 
the licensees pay us a royalty fee for sales of their products that incorporate our vr technology 
the licensees provide us with periodic reports that include the quantity of units  subject to royalty  sold to their end users 
we record the royalty when reported to us by the licensee  generally in the period during which the licensee ships the products containing vr technology 
our applications specific integrated circuit asic chips embodying vr are priced to include the cost of the chip plus an embedded royalty fee 
revenue on asic chip sales is recorded as product revenue when earned  which under our fob origin terms is upon shipment  of the underlying asic chip incorporating the vr technology to the customer 
available for sale securities available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and unrealized holding gains and temporary unrealized losses are recorded  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders deficit equity 
unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
and fsp fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fasb asc  step evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary  we reviewed several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  ii the extent to which fair value is less than cost  iii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iv our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method 
as of june   our other assets included million of ars that have a par value of million 
these securities are collateralized by corporate debt obligations 
as of june   these ars are rated bb by fitch ratings 
these ars are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  usually every days 
since july  our ars have experienced failed auctions and are considered to have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so 
the failed auctions for these securities have failed since july  which limits our ability to liquidate these securities and recover their carrying value in the near term 
our estimate of the fair value of the ars is based on the probability weighted expected future cash flows associated with the investments 
we may nonetheless attempt to liquidate these securities to meet cash needs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to liquidate these securities  and we expect that any liquidation in the near term may bring less than the carrying value of these securities  as of june   due to the lack of a market for these securities 
it is possible that we may be required to record additional impairments to these investments in future periods 
significant judgment is required in determining the fair value of investments when no quoted prices exist 
as allowed by statement of financial standards sfas no 
fasb asc  we elected to estimate the fair value of the ars using a discounted cash flow analysis 
taking into consideration the security terms the assumptions used by us included estimates of i when a successful auction would occur or the securities would mature or be redeemed  ii a discount rate commensurate with the implied risk associated with holding the securities  including consideration of the recent ratings downgrades and the lack of liquidity  and iii future expected cash flow streams 
if the auctions continue to fail  or we determine that one or more of the assumptions used in the estimate needs to be revised  we may be required to record an additional impairment on these securities in the future 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fasb asc  which changes the method for determining whether an other than temporary impairment exists for debt securities and the amount of an other than temporary impairment charge to be recorded in earnings 
accordingly  effective april   the following factors are reviewed to determine if a loss is other than temporary i whether we intend to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis  ii the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  iii the extent to which fair value is less than cost  and iv the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
upon adoption of fsp fas and fas  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that we may be required to sell the ars prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis and  accordingly  no adjustment was made to our accumulated deficit as of the adoption date 
as such  the adoption of fsp fas and fas had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
share based compensation share based compensation expense can be significant to our results of operations  even though no cash is used for such expense 
in determining period expense associated with unvested options  we estimate the fair value of each option at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the award 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term the average employee will hold the option prior to the date of exercise 
in addition  we estimate pre vesting forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we primarily use historical data to determine the inputs and assumptions to be used in the black scholes pricing model 
changes in these inputs and assumptions could occur and could materially affect the measure of estimated fair value and make it difficult to compare the results in future periods to our current results 
a change in our share based compensation for the year ended june  would have affected our net loss by  allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific accounts and the overall condition of the accounts receivable portfolio 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific trade and other receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customers payment terms and or patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make additional payments  then we may need to make additional allowances 
likewise  if we determine that we could realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  we would adjust the allowance to increase income in the period we made the determination 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as considered necessary 
generally  our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on specific identification 
if we fail to identify an account as doubtful  or if we identify an account as uncollectible that is later collected  our results could vary 
inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we assess the value of our inventories periodically based upon numerous factors including expected product or material demand  current market conditions  technological obsolescence  current cost and net realizable value 
if necessary  we adjust our inventory for obsolete or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  we may need to record additional inventory adjustments and adverse purchase commitments 
business acquisitions and intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in recognition of intangible assets acquired technology that affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
we amortize our definite lived intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets may include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  services  maintenance agreements  acquired development technologies  patents or trademarks  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  the period of time the acquired products and services will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
management estimates fair value and useful lives based upon assumptions that it believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur and assumptions may change 
estimates using different assumptions could produce significantly different results 
impairment of long lived assets we test for recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when the carrying value is not considered recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the related assets 
such impairment charges may be material 
fair value is generally determined based on the estimated future discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or asset group using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the assumptions supporting the cash flow analysis  including the discount rates  are determined using management s best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if our future results are significantly different than forecasted  we may be required to further evaluate our long lived assets for recoverability and record impairment charges for these assets that could adversely affect our results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million impairment related to our property and equipment 
see fiscal compared with fiscal impairment of long lived assets under the discussion of results of operations  below 
the estimated fair value of these assets was determined using the income approach  which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  as well as consideration of the estimated value that could be realized upon sale 
the assumptions used by us included estimates of i projected cash flows for a period approximating the remaining estimated useful life of the asset group  ii a discount rate commensurate with the implied risk in an investment in us and the risk of the underlying cash flows  and iii enterprise value 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an million impairment charge related to acquired technology 
see fiscal compared with fiscal impairment of long lived assets under the discussion of results of operations below 
warranty obligations we provide for estimated future costs of warranty obligations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies fasb asc  and disclose those obligations as required by fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fasb asc  product warranties 
for return to factory and on site warranties  we accrue for warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on contractual rights and on the historical rate of claims and costs to provide warranty services 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims above historical experience or our costs to provide warranty services increase  we may be required to increase our warranty accrual 
any such unforeseen increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
similarly  if we experience a decrease in warranty claims or our costs to provide services decline  we may be required to decrease our warranty accrual  which may have a favorable impact on our gross margins in the periods in which they occur 
income tax provision and uncertain tax positions the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes generally represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when we consider it more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
a decision to record a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a decrease in income tax benefit 
if the valuation allowance is released in a future period because we consider it more likely than not that the associated tax benefit will be realized  income tax expense will be reduced accordingly 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated income tax provision and evaluating our us and foreign tax positions 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fasb asc  deferred tax expense or benefit  which became effective for us beginning july  fin no 
addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution or audit 
if we are unable to uphold our position upon audit  it may impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on i the guidance in fin no 
 and ii our estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
restructuring charges in august and december  and in january and march  and over the past several years  we recorded restructuring charges related to the realignment and restructuring of our business operations 
these charges represent expenses incurred in connection with certain cost reduction programs and acquisition integrations that we have implemented and consist of the cost of involuntary termination benefits  separation benefits and excess facilities charges 
the charges for severance and exit costs require the use of estimates  primarily related to the amount of severance and related benefits to be paid and the cost of exiting facilities 
we account for restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fasb asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative impairment of long lived assets loss from operations other expense income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss a summary of the sales mix by product follows fiscal year tape based products neo series arcvault family other disk based products reo ultamus snap server service spare parts and other vr fiscal compared with fiscal net revenue 
net revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decline was primarily the result of anticipated lower oem revenue  specifically from hp  reflecting the previously announced transition by hp to an alternate supplier 
in our branded channel  the decrease in net revenue was attributable to decreased volumes across all channels 
product revenue net product revenue decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or net product revenue from oem customers decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily associated with declining sales to hp 
net revenue from hp represented of total net revenue during fiscal  compared with during fiscal net product revenue from overland branded products  excluding service revenue  decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  was primarily associated with decreases of million from neo products  million from arcvault products and million from reo products 
these decreases were partially offset by million of sales of snap server products  which we began selling in the first quarter of fiscal the overall decrease in sales of overland branded products is primarily a result of i the uncertainty in the world economy  ii a general decrease in it spending worldwide  and iii a reluctance to purchase our products due to uncertainty regarding our financial condition 
service revenue net service revenue increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase of million  or  is attributable to a million increase in warranty revenue associated with an increase in the number of service contracts sold due to increased sales efforts  partially offset by a million decrease in out of warranty services provided  primarily to hp 
royalty fees net royalty fees decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  is primarily associated with lower vr royalties and hp software royalties 
vr royalties during fiscal totaled million compared with million during fiscal hp software royalties were  and million during fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
overall gross profit increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  an increase of million  or 
gross margin increased to during fiscal from during fiscal an increase of 
product gross profit product gross profit decreased to million  or  for fiscal compared with million  or  for fiscal the million decrease in product gross profit is associated primarily with a million  or  decrease in product revenue 
this decrease was offset by i a million decrease in amortization expense because the okapi intangible was fully amortized as of june  and ii million in snap server revenues in fiscal  which began in fiscal and carry higher margins than most of our other products 
service gross profit service gross profit of million  or  for fiscal increased from million  or  for fiscal the increase in service gross profit of million  or  is primarily associated with an increase in warranty contracts recognized in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in service gross profit as a percentage of revenue is attributable to new service offerings and the addition of the snap server product line  which have more favorable margins 
share based compensation 
during fiscal  we had share based compensation expense of million compared with million in fiscal the decrease of approximately million is primarily due to a one time grant of stock options to acquire  in the aggregate  million shares of our common stock in august to executive officers and key employees as a retention tool 
the share based compensation expense associated with the august option grants was recognized primarily in fiscal these options vested monthly for one year and resulted in increased share based compensation expense through the first quarter of fiscal compensation expense associated with option and restricted stock awards with graded vesting is recognized on an accelerated basis in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and share based compensation was allocated as follows in thousands fiscal year change cost of product revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative fiscal cost reductions and restructuring of workforce 
during fiscal  we implemented several reductions in force as part of our cost cutting initiatives 
as part of the march restructuring  we terminated the employment of the sole employee in our colorado facility 
in april  we vacated this facility  the lease for which expires february in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of  to research and development expense for the estimated fair value of the liability associated with vacating this facility 
the following table summarizes the activity associated with the fiscal restructurings severance costs in thousands of workforce number of employees severance costs august december january march severance costs  including our payments of cobra premiums  are included in sales and marketing expense  research and development expense and general and administrative expense 
severance costs  including our payments of cobra premiums  are included in sales and marketing expense and research and development expense 
severance costs  including our payments of cobra premiums  are included in cost of goods sold  sales and marketing expense  research and development expense and general and administrative expense 
we implemented a temporary salary reduction following the january restructuring 
no amounts are reflected in these tables for such salary reduction 
the following table summarizes the activity and balances of accrued restructuring charges during fiscal and in thousands employee related facilities total balance at june  cash payments balance at june  accrued restructuring charges cash payments balance at june  sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million during fiscal  compared with million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to a decrease of million in employee and related expenses including i a million reduction in commissions as a result of reduced sales  ii a million reduction in travel expenses due to cost control efforts and a reduction in the number of trade shows and partner conferences attended or hosted  and iii the effects of a company wide temporary salary reduction implemented in january other cost reductions included a million reduction in public relations and advertising expense due to the reduction in trade shows and partner conferences attended or hosted  and a million reduction in outside contractor expenses due to cost control efforts 
these decreases were slightly offset by a million increase in severance associated with the fiscal restructurings 
research and development expense 
research and development expense remained relatively flat at million during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal there was a decrease of million in material intensive product development expenses due to the completion of scheduled r d projects 
this decrease was offset by i a million increase in employee and related expenses related to our acquisition of snap server in june  which increased average headcount by eight employees  and ii an increase of million in outside contractor expenses for tape library development 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million during fiscal  compared with million during fiscal the increase of million  or  is primarily due to i an increase of million in legal fees  for financing and strategic alternatives  ii an increase of million in amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of snap server in june  and iii an increase of million in outside contractor expenses  principally for financial and accounting services 
these increases were offset by i a decrease of million in depreciation expense due to lower carrying values of fixed assets  and ii a million decrease in employee and related expenses related to our fiscal restructurings 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property and equipment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management performed impairment analyses of its long lived assets as of june  and due to our continued operating and cash flow losses and our forecasts 
the impairment analysis as of june   excluded the long lived assets from the recently completed snap server acquisition note to the consolidated financial statements 
we concluded that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable as of june   and consequently we recognized an impairment loss of million 
management concluded that the carrying amount of the asset group including the long lived assets from the snap server acquisition which has been fully integrated into our operations was recoverable as of june   and therefore did not record an impairment loss on our long lived assets in fiscal interest income 
during fiscal  we generated interest income of million  compared with million during the prior fiscal year 
the decrease of million  or  is due to the decrease in cash and investment balances in fiscal compared with fiscal we liquidated our short term investments in the first quarter of fiscal interest expense 
we incurred interest expense of million and  during fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  we entered into two non oem accounts receivable financing agreements and converted million in accounts payable to a note the anacomp note 
under the non oem accounts receivable financing agreements we recorded interest expense of million  including million in amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest expense associated with our notes payable to anacomp and adaptec totaled million during fiscal during fiscal  no interest expense was recorded related to the note payable to adaptec 
other expense  net 
during fiscal  we incurred other expense  net  of million compared with million during fiscal the decrease of million in other expense  net  is primarily associated with million in realized currency exchange gains in fiscal  compared with  of realized currency exchange losses in fiscal losses on investments related to impairment charges under fsp fas and fasb asc were million in fiscal and million in fiscal provision for income taxes 
we recorded nominal income tax expense during fiscal compared with million during fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the expiration of statutes of limitations on certain tax positions and the favorable settlement of tax issues with the tax authorities

share based compensation 
during fiscal  we had share based compensation expense of million compared with a net reversal  or benefit  of  of share based compensation in fiscal the increase of million is primarily due to a one time grant of approximately million share options in august to executive officers and key employees as a retention tool

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property and equipment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management performed an impairment analysis of its long lived assets  excluding the long lived assets from the recently completed snap server acquisition note to the consolidated financial statements  as of june   due to the our continued operating and cash flow losses in and our forecasts for and beyond 
we concluded that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable and an impairment loss of million was recognized as of june  in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the technology acquired from zetta systems  inc zetta in august as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  management performed an impairment analysis of the technology acquired from zetta  in accordance with sfas no

during fiscal  we generated interest income of million compared with million during fiscal the decrease of million  or  is due to lower cash and investment balances in fiscal than in fiscal  and lower interest rates earned on such balances 
other expense  net 
during fiscal  we incurred other expense  net  of million  compared with million during fiscal the increase of million in other expense  net  is primarily associated with a million increase in realized losses on investments related to impairment charges under fsp sfas and fasb asc 
the increase was offset by a reduction of million in realized currency exchange losses incurred in fiscal compared with fiscal provision for income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million during fiscal compared with million during fiscal the increase of million is primarily due to higher earnings in the foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  compared with million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at june  we have no unused sources of liquidity at this time 
in november  we entered into a domestic non oem accounts receivable financing agreement with marquette commercial finance mcf 
in march  we entered into a foreign non oem accounts receivable financing agreement with faunus group international fgi 
in april  we entered into a secured note with anacomp  inc see note debt  to our consolidated condensed financial statements for a discussion of these financing arrangements under the headings mcf financing agreement  fgi financing agreement and anacomp note 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations 
however  we have incurred net losses for the last four fiscal years and negative cash flows for our last three fiscal years 
as of or for the year ended june   we had an accumulated deficit of million  a shareholders deficit of million  incurred a net loss of million  and the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined by million compared with the balance at june  we operate in a highly competitive market characterized by rapidly changing technology 
through calendar  we expect to continue to incur operating cash flow losses as we introduce and market our new products 
as of june   we have negative working capital of million  which is primarily attributable to a million decrease in current assets and a million increase in current liabilities 
the decrease in current assets is primarily attributable to reduced sales and inventory 
the increase in current liabilities is primarily driven by our non oem accounts receivable financing agreements 
current liabilities associated with these arrangements  including accrued interest  total million as of june  debt consists of the following as of june  in thousands principal accrued interest total current obligation under mcf financing agreement note payable to anacomp  including accrued interest obligation under fgi financing agreement note payable to adaptec  including accrued interest long term note payable to anacomp the following table summarizes the contractual payout schedule for principal and accrued interest in thousands mcf anacomp fgi adaptec total fiscal fiscal the company is not obligated to offer any accounts invoices in any month  and mcf has the right to decline to purchase any offered accounts invoices 
during fiscal  individual invoices declined by mcf were considered immaterial to the company s accounts receivable balance  financial position and cash flows 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the mcf financing agreement as of june  management continues to monitor the company s compliance with the dilution covenant  which is based on the aggregate amount of credit memoranda  discounts and other downward adjustments to the original invoiced price divided by gross collections 
based upon the company s current operating plan  the company expects to remain in compliance with the permissible dilution covenant throughout fiscal a significant increase in rebates claimed as a percentage of the company s gross collections could lead to the company s failure to satisfy the dilution covenant 
fgi may terminate the agreement upon default by the company  and may also terminate the agreement for convenience upon days advance notice 
the company may terminate the agreement at any time by paying a  termination fee 
the termination fee is not payable upon a termination by fgi or upon non renewal 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the fgi financing agreement at june  based upon the company s current operating plan  the company expects to remain in compliance with the terms of the fgi financing agreement throughout fiscal management has projected that cash on hand and funding available under our non oem accounts receivable financing agreements will be sufficient to allow us to continue operations at current levels for the next twelve months and beyond 
however  a shortfall from projected sales levels and a consequential decrease in eligible non oem receivables or a change to the historical timing of receivables could have a material adverse affect on our ability to access the necessary level of funding to continue operations at current levels 
in the event our access to receivables financing decreases  we may be forced to extend payment terms with suppliers where possible  to liquidate certain assets where possible  and or to suspend or curtail certain planned programs 
any of these actions could materially harm our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we intend to seek equity or equity based financing when market conditions permit 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  or securities convertible into shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our existing shareholders will be diluted 
the amount of dilution could be increased by the issuance of warrants or securities with other dilutive characteristics  such as anti dilution clauses or price resets 
if we need additional funding for operations and we are unable to raise it  we may be forced to liquidate assets and or curtail or cease operations 
as a result of our recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows  the report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
as of june   our other assets included million of ars that have a par value of million 
the auctions for these securities have failed since july  which limits our ability to liquidate these securities and recover their carrying value in the near term 
we may nonetheless attempt to liquidate these securities to meet cash needs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to liquidate these securities  and we expect that any liquidation in the near term may bring less than the carrying value of these securities  as of june   due to the lack of a market for these securities 
during fiscal  we used cash in operating activities of million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change from fiscal to of million was primarily attributable to the million decrease in accrued payroll and employee compensation as a result of our fiscal restructurings 
all accrued and unpaid vacation was paid out upon termination 
in addition  during fiscal we decreased the accrual rate and implemented a company wide temporary salary reduction  which further reduced the accrual 
the change from fiscal to of million was primarily attributable to our decreased net loss and decreases in our accounts receivable balance compared with fiscal cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal and cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal beginning in fiscal and through the first quarter of fiscal  we liquidated our short term investments to support operations 
in september  we liquidated our short term investments excluding our ars which are included in other assets 
during fiscal  we used cash of million to acquire snap server and made net purchases of short term investments of million 
during fiscal  and  capital expenditures totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  capital expenditures were primarily associated with the purchase of tooling for new products  computer equipment and software 
during fiscal  capital expenditures were primarily associated with tooling to support new product development 
during fiscal  capital expenditures were primarily associated with computers  machinery and equipment to support new product development and transitioning manufacturing in house 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million  compared with cash provided by financing activities of  during fiscal and compared with cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal during fiscal  million of cash provided by financing activities related to net funding activity from accounts receivable pledged to mcf and fgi 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began making payments against the adaptec note 
payments related to the anacomp note are scheduled to begin in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we used cash of million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
this use of cash in fiscal was partially offset by the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp and by the exercise of stock options for proceeds of  in fiscal proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our espp and upon exercise of stock options have decreased due to the decrease in our stock price since fiscal and the discount used in determining the purchase price under our espp 
in october  our board of directors terminated our share repurchase program and there were no share repurchases after the first quarter of fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties that are not fully recorded in our consolidated balance sheet or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations to make future payments at june  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations debt purchase obligations total contractual obligations represents contractual lease obligations under non cancellable operating leases on our san diego  ca  milpitas  ca  wokingham  england  paris  france  and singapore facilities represents non oem accounts receivable financing agreements with mcf and fgi  and notes payable to anacomp and adaptec  including accrued interest 
accrued interest as of june  totaled approximately million 
represents purchase orders for inventory and non inventory items entered into prior to june   with purchase dates extending beyond july  some of these purchase obligations may be cancelled 
liabilities associated with uncertain tax provisions  currently estimated at million including interest  are not included in the table above as we cannot reasonably estimate when  if ever  an amount would be paid to a government agency 
ultimate settlement of these liabilities is dependent on factors outside of our control  such as examinations by each agency and expiration of statues of limitation for assessment of additional taxes 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the periods presented 
historically we have been able to pass on to our customers increases in raw material prices caused by inflation 
if at any time we cannot pass on such increases  our margins could suffer 
our exposure to the effects of inflation could be magnified by the concentration of oem business  where our margins tend to be lower 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in us interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
all of our fixed income investments are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reclassified our ars to other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
these securities  although not mortgage backed  have experienced failed auctions primarily as a result of the impact that sub prime mortgages have had on liquidity in the credit markets 
accounts receivable financing arrangements 
for fiscal  interest expense associated with our non oem accounts receivable financing arrangements with mcf and fgi was million 
we entered into these arrangements during fiscal the fixed or variable discount herein after referred to as an interest rate under the mcf agreement does not vary with prevailing interest rates  however it is based upon the time elapsed from funding by mcf to settlement of invoices by the customer 
under the mcf agreement the interest rate charged is a minimum of and a maximum of 
during fiscal  the average interest rate charged was approximately 
assuming the levels of receivables factored under the mcf agreement were to fluctuate increase or decrease by or million on an annualized basis  we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in our interest expense of  during fiscal the interest rate under the fgi agreement is equal to the greater of i or ii above fgi s prime rate 
assuming levels of factored receivables under the fgi agreement remained consistent with those experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  if interest rates were to fluctuate increase or decrease by or basis points  we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in our interest expense of million during fiscal assuming the levels of receivables factored under the fgi agreement were to fluctuate increase or decrease by or million on an annualized basis  we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in our interest expense of  during fiscal ars instruments 
for fiscal  interest income was million with ars investments yielding an annual average of 
the average annual interest rate was down approximately basis points from in fiscal assuming consistent investment levels  if interest rates were to fluctuate increase or decrease by or basis points  we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in our interest income of  during fiscal cash equivalents and short term investments 
for fiscal  total interest income was  with investments yielding an annual average of on a worldwide basis 
the average annual interest rate was down approximately basis points from in fiscal assuming consistent investment levels  if interest rates were to fluctuate increase or decrease by or basis points  we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in our interest income of  during fiscal the table below presents the cash and cash equivalents balance and related weighted average interest rate at the end of fiscal the cash and cash equivalents balances approximate fair value in thousands approximate market value weighted average interest rate cash and cash equivalents the table above includes the us dollar equivalent of cash and cash equivalents  including million and million equivalents denominated in the british pound and the euro  respectively 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business on a global basis and essentially all sales in international markets are denominated in us dollars 
historically  export sales have represented a significant portion of our sales and are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france and germany incur costs that are denominated in local currencies 
as exchange rates vary  these results when translated into us dollars may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain of million for fiscal
