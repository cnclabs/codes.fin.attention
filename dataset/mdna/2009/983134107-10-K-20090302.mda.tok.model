we have commenced construction on a further expansion of wynn macau that will add a fully integrated resort hotel named encore at wynn macau  with approximately luxury suites and four villas  as well as additional vip gaming areas  food and beverage and retail amenities 
we expect encore at wynn macau to open in in response to our evaluation of wynn macau and the reactions of our guests  we have and expect to continue to make enhancements and refinements to the property 
we operate wynn macau under a year casino concession agreement granted by the macau government in june future development approximately acres of land comprising wynn las vegas and encore at wynn las vegas is currently improved with a golf course 
while we may develop this property in the future  due to the current economic environment and certain restrictions in our credit facilities  we have no immediate plans to develop this property 

table of contents we have applied to the government of macau for a land concession for approximately acres on cotai and are awaiting final governmental approval of this concession 
no construction timeline or budget have been prepared 
current economic and operating environment due to a number of factors affecting consumers  including a slowdown in global economies  contracting credit markets  and reduced consumer spending  and new us political leadership  the outlook for the gaming  travel  and entertainment industries both domestically and abroad remains highly uncertain 
auto traffic into las vegas  airline capacity and air travel to mccarran international airport have declined  resulting in lower casino volumes and a reduced demand for hotel rooms 
this slow down was particularly significant in the fourth quarter of and has continued into the first quarter of based on our experience in and current market conditions  we believe that wynn las vegas and encore at wynn las vegas will continue to experience lower than historical hotel occupancy rates  room rates  casino volumes and accordingly lower departmental profitability 
as a result of the current economic conditions  we have increasingly focused on efficiency initiatives that we began implementing at our las vegas properties and corporate in early these initiatives include reductions in pay for salaried employees in las vegas  reduced work weeks for full time hourly employees  a substantial reduction of bonus accruals and a suspension of the employer match to the k contributions 
we expect that these initiatives  along with other operational efficiencies  will save approximately million annually 
we are continually reviewing the cost and efficiencies at our operating properties and corporate to identify further opportunities to reduce costs during these uncertain economic times 
wynn macau has also been impacted by the slowing global economy and visa restrictions implemented in september the factors described above accelerated through with fourth quarter results in las vegas significantly weaker than additionally  in early  we have experienced cancellation and attrition of group business at greater than historical levels 
results of operations our results of operations for the periods presented are not comparable for the following reasons on september   we opened wynn macau  on september   wynn macau completed the sale of a macau subconcession right and recognized a pre tax gain of million  on december   we opened an expansion at wynn macau  and on december   we opened encore at wynn las vegas 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  include a full year of operations for the expansion at wynn macau and days of operations for encore at wynn las vegas 
the year ended december  includes a full year of operations for wynn las vegas and days of operations for wynn macau 
in addition  we believe that our operating results at wynn las vegas  encore at wynn las vegas and wynn macau for the year ended december  have been adversely impacted by the weakened global economy 
disruptions in the global financial and stock markets and reduced levels of consumer spending have and may continue to adversely impact our financial results 
in addition  as noted above  visa restrictions have placed certain limitations on visitation to macau 
these restrictions have and will continue to adversely impact visitation to macau by residents of mainland china 

table of contents the table below displays our net revenues for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands for the years ended december  net revenues wynn las vegas  including encore wynn macau total net revenues reliance on only three properties in two geographic regions for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors  whose operations are more diversified  may be better able to control 
in addition to the concentration of operations in three properties  many of our customers are high end gaming customers who wager on credit  thus exposing us to increased credit risk 
high end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results 
operating measures certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented 
casinos generally record table games win as a percentage of either drop or turnover and slot win as a percentage of handle
