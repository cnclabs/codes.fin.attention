item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and market premium branded spirits in the following distilled spirit categories vodka  rum  whiskey  liqueurs and tequila 
we distribute these spirits in all us states and the district of columbia  in nine primary international markets  including ireland  great britain  northern ireland  germany  canada  france  italy  sweden and the duty free markets  and in a number of other countries in continental europe 
we market the following brands  among others  boru vodka  pallini liqueurs  gosling s rum  clontarf irish whiskey  knappogue castle whiskey  jefferson s tm  jefferson s reserve and sam houston bourbons and tierras tm tequila 
our objective is to continue building a distinctive portfolio of global premium spirits brands 
we have been shifting our focus from a volume oriented approach to a profit centric focus 
to achieve this  we are seeking to increase revenues from existing spirits brands 
we are focusing our existing distribution relationships  sales expertise and targeted marketing activities to concentrate on our more profitable brands  expand our domestic and international distribution relationships to increase the mutual benefits of concentrating on our most profitable brands  while continuing to achieve brand recognition and growth and gain additional market share for our brands within retail stores  bars and restaurants  and thereby with end consumers  improve value chain and manage cost structure 
we have undergone a comprehensive review and analysis of our supply chains and cost structures both on a company wide and brand by brand basis 
this has included restructurings and personnel reductions throughout our company 
we further intend to map  analyze and redesign our purchasing and supply systems to reduce costs in our current operations and achieve profitability in future operations  and selectively add new premium brands to our spirits portfolio 
we intend to continue developing new brands and pursuing strategic relationships  joint ventures and acquisitions to selectively expand our premium spirits portfolio  particularly by capitalizing on and expanding our already demonstrated partnering capabilities 
our criteria for new brands focuses on underserved areas of the spirits and or wine marketplace  while examining the potential for direct financial contribution to our company and the potential for future growth based on development and maturation of agency brands 
we will evaluate future acquisitions and agency relationships on the basis of their potential to be immediately accretive and their potential contributions to our objectives of becoming profitable and further expanding our product offerings 
we expect that future acquisitions  if consummated  would involve some combination of cash  debt and the issuance of our stock 
cost containment we have taken significant steps over the past twelve months to reduce our costs  resulting in a decrease in selling expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal these steps included reducing staff in both the us and international operations  restructuring our international distribution system  changing distributor relationships in certain markets  restructuring the gosling castle partners  inc working relationship  moving production of certain products to a lower cost facility in the us  and reducing general and administrative costs  including professional fees  insurance  occupancy and other overhead costs 
efforts to further reduce expenses continue 
we are engaged in a rigorous expense reduction effort across the entire supply chain of our brands 
we are examining each step of the process of sourcing our brands to both improve quality and reduce cost

operations overview we generate revenue through the sale of our premium spirits to our network of wholesale distributors or  in control states  state owned agencies  which  in turn  distribute our premium brands to retail outlets 
in the us  our sales price per case includes excise tax and import duties  which are also reflected in a corresponding increase in our cost of sales 
most of our international sales are sold in bond  with the excise taxes paid by our customers upon shipment  thereby resulting in lower relative revenue as well as a lower relative cost of sales  although some of our united kingdom sales are sold tax paid  as in the united states 
the difference between sales and net sales principally reflects adjustments for various distributor incentives 
our gross profit is determined by the prices at which we sell our products  our ability to control our cost of sales  the relative mix of our case sales by brand and geography and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
our cost of sales is principally driven by our cost of procurement  bottling and packaging  which differs by brand  as well as freight and warehousing costs 
we purchase certain products  such as the gosling s rums  pallini liqueurs and tierras tequila  as finished goods 
for other products  such as the boru vodkas  we purchase the components  including the distilled spirits  bottles and packaging materials  and have arrangements with third parties for bottling and packaging 
our us sales typically have a higher absolute gross margin than in other markets  as sales prices per case are generally higher in the us than elsewhere 
selling expense principally includes advertising and marketing expenditures and compensation paid to our marketing and sales personnel 
our selling expense  as a percentage of sales and per case  is higher than that of our competitors because of our brand development costs  level of marketing expenditures and established sales force versus our relatively small base of case sales and sales volumes 
however  we believe that building an infrastructure capable of supporting future growth is the correct long term approach for us 
while we expect the absolute level of selling expense to increase in the coming years  we expect selling expense as a percentage of revenues and on a per case basis to decline  as our volumes expand and our sales team sells a larger number of brands 
general and administrative expense relates to corporate and administrative functions that support our operations and includes administrative payroll  occupancy and related expenses and professional services 
we expect general and administrative expense to decrease in fiscal as certain severance and stock based compensation expenses from a workforce reduction will end 
we expect our general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales to decline due to economies of scale 
we expect to increase our case sales in the us and internationally over the next several years through organic growth  and through the extension of our product line via acquisitions and distribution agreements 
we will seek to maintain liquidity and manage our working capital and overall capital resources during this period of anticipated growth to achieve our long term objectives  although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we believe the following industry trends will create growth opportunities for us  including the divestiture of smaller and emerging non core brands by major spirits companies as they continue to consolidate  increased barriers to entry  particularly in the us  due to continued consolidation and the difficulty in establishing an extensive distribution network  such as the one we maintain  the trend by small private and family owned spirits brand owners to partner with  or be acquired by  a company with global distribution 
we expect to be an attractive alternative to our larger competitors for these brand owners as one of the few modestly sized publicly traded spirits companies  and growth in the non spirits segments of the beverage alcohol industry  which may allow us to grow our portfolio and leverage our distribution network 
our growth strategy is based upon partnering with other brands  acquiring smaller and emerging brands and growing existing brands 
to identify potential partner and acquisition candidates we plan to rely on our management s industry experience and our extensive network of industry contacts 
we also plan to maintain and grow our us and international distribution channels so that we are more attractive to spirits companies who are looking for a route to market for their products 
with respect to foreign and small private and family owned spirits brands  we will continue to be flexible and creative in the structure and form of our proposals and present an alternative to the larger spirits companies 
our ability to build our brands and to attract new agency brands has been frustrated by our capital position 
we have significantly reduced our cash burn in the past year 
we believe that the infusion of million in equity in the series a preferred stock transaction  the conversion of million of debt and accrued interest to equity and our reduced cash burn have stabilized our company and will allow us to grow our brands  pursue new agency relationships and acquire additional brands as per our original vision 
we intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources  bank borrowings and  in appropriate circumstances  the further issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position  and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
additionally  the pursuit of acquisitions and other new business relationships may require significant management attention 
we may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates  obtain financing on favorable terms or complete these types of transactions in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
financial performance overview the following table provides information regarding our case sales for the periods presented based on nine liter equivalent cases  which is a standard spirits industry metric 
years ended march  cases united states international total vodka rum liqueurs whiskey tequila total percentage of cases united states international total vodka rum liqueurs whiskey tequila total critical accounting policies and estimates a number of estimates and assumptions affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  amounts of sales and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions discussed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations in that they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical to our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped to a customer generally a distributor  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale fob shipping point or fob destination and collection is reasonably assured 
we do not offer a right of return but will accept returns if we shipped the wrong product or wrong quantity 
revenue is not recognized on shipments to control states in the united states until such time as product is sold through to the retail channel 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts 
we calculate this allowance based on our history of write offs  level of past due accounts based on contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with  and economic status of  our customers 
inventory valuation our inventory  which consists of distilled spirits  dry good raw materials bottles  labels and caps  packaging and finished goods  is valued at the lower of cost or market  using the weighted average cost method 
we assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
reduction to the carrying value of inventories is recorded in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of march  and  goodwill that arose from acquisitions was and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of rights  trademarks  trade names and formulations 
we are required to analyze our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to  operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step the fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair values of the reporting units and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of such reporting units 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined at each of march  and by weighting a combination of the present value of our discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on market multiples of revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable companies 
such valuations resulted in us recording a goodwill impairment of approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and an impairment on other intangible assets of million for fiscal we did not record an impairment on other intangible assets for fiscal intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we are required to amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to the estimated residual values and to review intangible assets with estimable useful lives for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
stock based awards we follow sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values on the date of grant 
stock based compensation for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during fiscal and are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties and requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments 
we believe that there is no material difference between the fair value and the reported amounts of financial instruments in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments  or with respect to the debt  as our compared to the current borrowing rates available to us 
further  our investments have been classified within level of sfas no 
 fair value measurements and are reported at fair value 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements 
years ended march  sales  net cost of sales gross profit selling expense years ended march  general and administrative expense depreciation and amortization goodwill and other intangible asset impairment loss from operations other income other expense foreign exchange gain loss interest expense  net gain on exchange of convertible subordinated notes current credit on derivative financial instrument income tax benefit minority interests net loss fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in the prior year period 
historically  our sales in ireland have been made in bond net of excise taxes 
during fiscal  we made sales to our distributor in ireland ex bond that included million in excise taxes and vat 
the million of excise tax is included in the prior year period net sales 
net of the effect of this one time increase to net sales in the fiscal year  net sales during fiscal increased million due to our continued focus on our more profitable brands and markets and our overall pricing strategy 
our international case sales and revenue decreased  during fiscal  as evidenced by a reduction in case sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to our efforts to focus on our more profitable brands and markets  difficult market conditions in ireland  northern ireland and great britain and the inability of our former distributor in ireland to stabilize distribution in that market and regain the points of distribution lost during the transition  which resulted in a significant loss of market share 
our us case sales as a percentage of total case sales increased to during fiscal as compared to in fiscal us net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our shift from a volume oriented approach to a profit centric approach caused us to adjust our sales and marketing efforts in certain us markets in an effort to yield more profitable results 
this shift resulted in lower sales of boru vodka in some markets 
the growth in us sales reflects the momentum of our portfolio in the us  particularly for gosling s rums  our whiskeys and certain of our liqueurs 
the table below presents the increase or decrease  as applicable  in case sales by product category for fiscal as compared to fiscal increase decrease percentage in case sales increase decrease overall us overall us vodka rum whiskey liqueurs tequila total gross profit 
gross profit increased to million during fiscal from million in the comparable prior year period  while our gross margin increased to during the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the comparable prior period 
fiscal gross profit was negatively affected by a million increase in our allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory recorded in that period 
in fiscal we recouped million of this allowance by selling certain items included in the original allowance 
absent the fiscal allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory and the partial recoupment thereof in fiscal  our gross profit in fiscal decreased by million over the prior period 
the increase in gross margin percentage is a result of the negative effects of the million of excise tax included in the prior period from an ex bond sale to our distributor in ireland  as well as the positive effects of price increases on certain products  improvements in certain routes to market and a focus on more profitable brands in selling expense 
selling expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in the comparable prior year period 
this decrease in selling expense was attributable to our cost containment efforts described in the overview section above  including a decrease in advertising  marketing and promotion of million in fiscal compared to fiscal we also reduced sales and marketing staff in both our domestic and international operations  resulting in a decrease of employee expense  including salaries  related benefits and travel and entertainment  of million in fiscal against fiscal these savings were offset by million in severance charges and million in stock based compensation expense incurred in connection with the vesting of all outstanding options concurrent with the series a preferred stock transaction described above and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of our continued cost containment efforts  selling expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to for fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal when compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
reductions in general and administrative staff resulted in million in severance expense in the period 
also  we recorded million in stock based compensation expense upon the vesting of all outstanding options concurrent with the series a preferred stock transaction 
our provision for doubtful accounts increased million due to one customer 
these increases were offset by decreases of million in professional fees  million in employee related expenses and million in other general and administrative expense when compared to fiscal  due to our ongoing cost containment efforts 
as a result  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal due to a million charge to fiscal expense from a change in the estimated useful life of our supply agreement with the carbery group ltd 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment 
under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the fair value of each of our reporting units was determined at march  and by weighting a combination of the present value of our discounted anticipated future operating cash flows and values based on ebitda of comparable companies 
the valuations resulted in a goodwill impairment of approximately million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively  and an impairment on other intangible assets of million for fiscal we did not record an impairment on other intangible assets for fiscal loss from operations 
as a result of the foregoing  our loss from operations improved million to million for fiscal from million in the comparable prior year period 
foreign exchange loss 
foreign exchange loss during fiscal was million as compared to a gain of million in fiscal due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound and its effect on our euro denominated intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense decreased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal due to the elimination of interest expense  offset by the write off of deferred financing costs  both the result of the conversion of substantially all of our debt in connection with the series a preferred stock transaction described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
gain on exchange of convertible notes 
the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes resulted in a pre tax non cash gain of million in fiscal minority interest 
minority interest during fiscal amounted to a credit of million as compared to a credit of million in fiscal as a result of a reduced loss recorded by our owned subsidiary  gosling castle partners  inc net loss 
as a result of the net effects of the foregoing  net loss for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal net loss per common share  basic and diluted  was per share in fiscal as compared to per share in fiscal net loss per common share basic and diluted was positively affected by the increase in common shares outstanding resulting from the common shares issued in connection with the series a preferred stock transaction 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our industry is subject to seasonality with peak sales in each major category generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter  which is our third fiscal quarter 
this holiday demand typically results in slightly higher sales for us in our second and or third fiscal quarters 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have incurred significant operating and net losses and have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
for fiscal  we had a net loss of million and used cash of million in operating activities 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficiency of million 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in october  we completed a million private placement of our series a preferred stock with certain investors 
in connection with the transaction  substantially all of the holders of castle brands usa inc s senior secured notes  in the principal amount of million plus accrued but unpaid interest  and all holders of our convertible notes  in the principal amount of million plus accrued but unpaid interest  converted their notes into shares of series a preferred stock 
the closing of the cash investment and the conversion of substantially all of our outstanding debt should provide us with sufficient funds to execute our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
we continue to implement a plan supporting the growth of existing brands through sales and marketing initiatives that we expect will generate cash flows from operations in the next few years 
as part of this plan  we seek to grow our business through expansion to new markets  growth in existing markets and strengthened distributor relationships 
we are also seeking additional brands and agency relationships to leverage our existing distribution platform 
we intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources  bank borrowings and  in appropriate circumstances  the further issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position  could materially reduce our liquidity and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
we are also taking a systematic approach to expense reduction  seeking improvements in routes to market and containing production costs to improve cash flows 
as of march   we had stockholders equity of million and working capital of million  compared to million and million  respectively  as of march  the increase in stockholders equity is primarily attributable to the series a preferred stock transaction 
working capital decreased as we had a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  as compared to million as of march  the increase is directly attributable to the capital raised in the series a preferred stock transaction 
part of the proceeds from the transaction was used to fund our fiscal operating losses 
also  we funded operating losses from net proceeds of million from the sale of short term investments 
at march   we also had approximately million of cash restricted from withdrawal and held by a bank in ireland as collateral for overdraft coverage  creditors insurance  revolving credit  and other working capital purposes 
the following may result in a material decrease in our liquidity over the near to mid term continued significant levels of cash losses from operations  an increase in working capital requirements to finance higher levels of inventories and accounts receivable  our ability to maintain and improve our relationships with our distributors and our routes to market  our ability to procure raw materials at a favorable price to support our level of sales  potential acquisition of additional spirits brands  and expansion into new markets and within existing markets in the united states and internationally 
cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the periods presented years ended march  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign currency translation net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
a substantial portion of available cash has been used to fund our operating activities 
in general  these cash funding requirements are based on operating losses  driven chiefly by our sizable investment in our distribution system and sales and marketing activities 
with increases in our overall sales volumes  we have also utilized cash to fund our receivables and inventories 
in general  these increases are only partially offset by increases in our accounts payable to our suppliers and accrued expenses 
on average  the production cycle for our owned brands is up to three months from the time we obtain the distilled spirits and other materials needed to bottle and package our products to the time we receive products available for sale  in part due to the international nature of our business 
we do not produce gosling s rums  pallini liqueurs or tierras tequila 
instead  we receive the finished product directly from the owners of such brands 
from the time we have products available for sale  an additional three to four months may be required before we sell our inventory and collect payment from customers 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million  consisting primarily of losses from operations of million  a decrease in allowance for obsolete inventories of million and a million decrease of the minority interest in the net loss of our owned subsidiary  gosling castle partners 
these uses of cash were offset partially by the effects of changes in foreign exchange of million  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a million increase in due to related parties  stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a goodwill and other intangible asset impairment of million

these facilities are payable on demand  continue until terminated by either party  are subject to annual review and call for interest at the lender s aa rate minus 
we have deposited million million with the bank to secure these borrowings we believe we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our irish bank facilities 
senior notes 
in  our wholly owned subsidiary castle brands usa  issued million of senior notes secured by accounts receivable and inventories of castle brands usa 
these notes were to mature on may  and bore interest at payable semi annually 
the senior notes were guaranteed by us 
in  the maturity date of these notes was changed to may  and the interest rate was increased to 
in november  castle brands usa inc issued an aggregate of million of additional senior secured notes 
these notes were to mature on may  and bore interest at payable semi annually 
as described above  in october  holders of these notes  in the principal amount of million plus million of accrued but unpaid interest  converted their notes into series a preferred stock at a price per preferred share of which was  in effect upon conversion  per share of our common stock 
the remaining unconverted notes  in the principal amount of million  were amended so that  among other things  the interest rate was reduced to  payable at maturity 
these notes and all accrued but unpaid interest were repurchased in may for  shares of our common stock 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations during fiscal or severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations
