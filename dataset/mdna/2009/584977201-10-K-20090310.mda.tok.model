executive overview our business we are engaged primarily in distinct  but very much related businesses  which for financial reporting purposes are divided into two reportable segments laboratory services and product sales 
for financial information relating to our segments  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
laboratory services our laboratory services business segment includes the activities of our wholly owned subsidiary  medtox laboratories  inc medtox laboratories  inc engages in drugs of abuse testing services  providing these services to private and public companies  drug treatment counseling centers  criminal justice facilities  occupational health clinics and hospitals  as well as third party administrators 
medtox laboratories  inc also provides clinical and other laboratory services which consist of clinical toxicology  clinical testing for the pharmaceutical industry eg  central laboratory services  bioanalytical  and pharmacokinetic testing  and analysis of heavy and trace metals 
we provide these services to hospitals  clinics  hmos and small to mid sized biotech and pharmaceutical companies and other laboratories 
testing is conducted using methodologies that include various immunoassays  gas liquid chromatography  gas chromatography mass spectrometry  and high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
we recently expanded our clinical other laboratory services to include laboratory tests used by physicians and other healthcare providers for the purpose of diagnosing or treating disease or illness or the assessment of health in humans 
testing is performed on blood  body fluids or tissues 
our comprehensive clinical laboratory services includes clinical chemistry  hematology  coagulation  urinalysis  immunology serology viruses  infectious diseases  immune system immunohematology blood typing  antibody screens  microbiology bacteria  parasites  anatomical pathology cytology tissue biopsies  cancer  molecular diagnostics infectious diseases  genetic disorders and sub specialties of these categories 
we also provide services in the areas of logistics management  data management and program management 
these services support our underlying business of laboratory analysis and provide added value to our clients 
the new brighton business center  llc nbbc is a wholly owned limited liability company formed for the sole purpose of acquiring the facilities in st 
paul  minnesota  where our laboratory services administrative offices and laboratory operations are located 
product sales our product sales business segment consists of our wholly owned subsidiary  medtox diagnostics  inc medtox diagnostics  inc 
is engaged in the development  manufacturing  and distribution of a variety of poct diagnostic drug screening devices  such as our profile ii  profile ii a  profile iii  profile iii a  profile ii er  profile iii er  profile iv  medtoxscan reader  verdict ii  and sure screen products  in addition to other diagnostic tests for the detection of alcohol 
medtox diagnostics  inc also provides contract manufacturing services  such as coagulation market controls 
the operations of the product sales segment are located in burlington  north carolina  where we maintain the offices  research and development laboratories  production operations  and warehouse distribution facilities 
in january  we announced that we were voluntarily recalling approximately medtoxscan electronic readers because of mis branding 
the profile iii er devices sold for use with the readers and which are properly cleared for sale by the fda  can be read visually without the reader 
the readers were provided to customers at no cost  therefore the direct financial impact of the recall is limited to shipping fees which are estimated to be less than  it had been our original intention to replace these readers with a new generation of reader having over the counter otc approval in as a result of the recall  we sought prescription use clearance for the new reader 
we filed a k application in march the fda requested additional data and studies as well as certain modifications to our product labeling and package insert which we completed 
on february   we received k clearance from the fda to market our medtoxscan electronic readers 
to date  we have not experienced significant attrition of clients for this product line 
key trends influencing our operating results our management believes that there are several notable trends that are currently influencing  and are expected in the foreseeable future to continue to influence  our operating results 
these include economic uncertainties causing variability in testing volumes in the laboratory services  drugs of abuse business in  testing volume from our existing workplace drugs of abuse clients was lower than in the prior year  which we primarily attributed to lower new job creation and reduced employee turnover caused by economic uncertainties 
we feel economic uncertainties may continue to cause variability in our workplace drugs of abuse testing volume in the foreseeable future 
increased poct diagnostic device test competition we have experienced increased competition with respect to our poct diagnostic tests from systems and products developed by others  many of whom compete solely on price 
as the number of firms marketing diagnostic tests has grown  we have experienced increased price competition for certain diagnostic testing devices  particularly in the probation  parole and rehabilitation market 
our strategy our strategy is to drive profitable growth by building market share  leveraging our existing infrastructure and technical expertise  and driving innovation 
we maintain a disciplined culture  focused on the successful execution of our strategy and plans 
building market share we have solid niche positions in large markets  relative to our size  that allow us to build market share by offering high quality products and services that are delivered rapidly  priced competitively  and supported by excellent customer service and value added services 
our value added services include data management  collection site management  training  technical support and expertise  as well as review of drug testing policies for clients 
our success in penetrating new accounts has represented a significant component of our growth in market share 
over the past three years  we have expanded our number of sales representatives from to the increase in sales representatives has increased our business from new accounts in and helps offset risks from uncertain economic conditions that may result in lower activity from existing workplace drugs of abuse clients 
leveraging existing infrastructure and technical expertise we leverage our existing infrastructure and technical expertise to facilitate top line growth and improve operating margins 
in  we expanded our clinical laboratory capabilities to include clinical and anatomic pathology  microbiology  molecular diagnostics  and other specialized testing capabilities 
this expansion leverages existing capabilities and opens up new revenue opportunities by offering full service testing capabilities to the physician office market 
our lean and six sigma initiatives support our effort to leverage existing infrastructure by improving quality and productivity  cutting costs  and increasing throughput 
lean is a highly disciplined process that helps us focus on reducing waste and eliminating unnecessary steps in our business processes 
our six sigma initiatives address quality and variability within processes 
while all key departments in the laboratory services and product sales segments have now been through initial lean processes  as an organization we recognize that lean is an ongoing philosophy  not a project to be finished 
driving innovation we have introduced a number of innovative products and services 
in  we introduced toxassure  a comprehensive program for effective pain management testing 
in  we continued improvement in our manufacturing processes in the diagnostic area  resulting in greater flexibility of product configurations for clients  increased efficiency in manufacturing and improved device performance 
we can now offer a higher degree of customization to our clients  both in terms of specific assays on a particular device  and supplying a private label device to large clients 
in  we initiated a relationship with one private label client 
in  we developed and introduced medtoxscan  an electronic reader  which we provide to hospitals for use with our profile ii er and profile iii er poct devices in hospital laboratories and emergency rooms 
in  we developed and introduced echain  our web based electronic chain of custody and donor tracking system 
we currently have over  clinics and collection sites utilizing echain throughout the country 
in  we also introduced sure screen  our lower detection level poct device targeted for the government and rehabilitation markets and our profile iii device  an integrated cup and testing device for sale to the workplace drug testing market 
clearcourse  another innovative solution we offer  is a comprehensive drug testing program that combines four essential components drug abuse recognition system dars training  sure screen on site drug screening devices  laboratory based confirmation testing and webtox online data management 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to understanding our business and results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current creditworthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have generally been within our historical expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have occurred in the past 
our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
revenue recognition revenues from laboratory services are recognized as earned when we have performed the applicable laboratory testing services and the results have been sent to our customers or posted to our secure website 
some of our laboratory services revenues for certain types of tests are billed to third party payers including insurance companies  state medicaid and medicare agencies 
these payers pay for such services at established amounts  which are typically lower than gross amounts billed by us 
however  the tests are sometimes billed directly to patients or other parties and paid at the gross amount billed for these tests 
in addition  billings for the tests are occasionally re billed to alternative payers in situations where incorrect billing information was submitted to us by the customer 
historically  the amounts of such incorrect billings have not been material 
we estimate a discount on the billings for these tests and recognize revenues and related accounts receivable at a net amount  after discount  in order to state revenues and accounts receivable at the amount expected to be paid 
while we believe that estimated discounts and the related net revenues and net accounts receivable from these testing services are materially correct  there can be differences in amounts ultimately paid compared to estimated amounts 
these differences are recorded upon payment and may affect previously recorded amounts 
we consider contracted rates with payers and historical discounts when estimating future discounts on a monthly basis 
revenues from product sales are recognized fob shipping point net of an allowance for estimated returns 
when shipment occurs  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
off site supplies inventory off site supplies represent collection kits and forms located at collection sites throughout the united states used by laboratory services customers to submit specimens for testing services 
these inventories are recorded at the lower of historical cost or market 
at december   off site inventory was million 
the process for valuing off site inventory involves making significant assumptions regarding the average time that a collection site uses the inventory  as well as the amount of inventory expected to be scrapped 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
no impairments were indicated as a result of our annual impairment reviews for goodwill and other intangible assets in  or in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase or decrease the valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating losses nols carried forward 
in the future  revisions to the estimated net realizable value of these deferred tax assets could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nols is completely utilized or expires unused 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
at december   we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits 
results of operations in evaluating our financial performance  our management has primarily focused on three objectives maximizing operating income  increasing our cash flows and strengthening our balance sheet 
the first of these objectives is discussed in this section 
the other two are addressed under liquidity and capital resources 
to maximize our operating income  we have sought revenue growth  improved gross margins and reduced selling  general and administrative sg a expense as a percentage of revenues 
as discussed below  during we were able to achieve solid revenue growth and reduced sg a expense as a percentage of revenues 
however  we experienced a decrease in gross margin due primarily to higher costs associated with our clinical laboratory expansion as well as the impact of product mix in our product sales segment 
revenues year ended december vs vs change change change change revenues laboratory services product sales our laboratory services segment includes revenues from drugs of abuse testing services and revenues from clinical other laboratory services 
our revenues from drugs of abuse testing grew to million and to million in and  respectively 
new account revenues were strong in  but were offset by an decline in revenues from existing drugs of abuse clients due to challenging economic conditions affecting hiring decisions by those clients 
we expect a continuing negative impact on revenue from our drugs of abuse clients in caused by the negative economic conditions affecting hiring 
the growth in was driven by an increase in sample volume from new accounts  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average price per testing specimen 
pricing for our workplace drugs of abuse testing services tends to be fairly stable overall  however  the average price per testing specimen can vary slightly from quarter to quarter 
test price can vary by client based on the percentage of samples that test positive for drugs of abuse and the average number of samples per shipment 
revenues from our clinical and other laboratory services increased to million and to million in and  respectively 
the improvement in both and was driven by strong growth in testing for our clinical trial services business 
the increase in was also due to growth generated by our expanded clinical laboratory capabilities 
revenues from clinical trial services can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the project nature  size  and the actual timing of clinical trials 
we also entered with signed protocols  in addition to other awarded business  which may have the potential to exceed million in future clinical trials services activity 
our product sales segment includes revenues from point of collection on site testing products poct  contract manufacturing services and other diagnostic products 
sales of poct products  which consist of the profile ii  profile ii a  profile ii er  profile iii er  profile iii  profile iii a  profile iv  verdict ii and sure screen on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased to million and to million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to strong sales of sure screen devices in the government market as well as growth of our profile er devices in the hospital market 
sales of our profile er devices continued to increase in  but at a lower growth rate than the previous year due to the impact of our reader recall 
the gain in sales in the government and hospital markets in was partially offset by an decrease in revenues from device sales in the workplace market attributable to tough economic conditions affecting hiring decisions 
overall  pricing for our poct devices in was slightly lower than the prior year period 
the growth in primarily reflected strong sales of profile iii er  sure screen and profile iii a devices 
sales of contract manufacturing services increased to million in and decreased to million in after an analysis of this product category in  we concluded that it had diminishing opportunities for us  and we plan to exit the contract manufacturing services business over the next months 
based on the expected increased sales of higher margin poct products  we do not anticipate a significant impact on our results of operations from exiting this business 
sales of other diagnostic products decreased million to million in due to the phase out of agricultural testing products in late sales of other diagnostic products increased million to million in cost of revenues and gross margin year ended december vs vs of revenues of revenues of revenues change change change change cost of revenues cost of services cost of sales cost of services as a percentage of laboratory services revenues cost of sales as a percentage of product sales revenues consolidated gross margin decreased to of revenues in  compared to of revenues in and of revenues in laboratory services gross margin was in  down from in and in in  gross margin was impacted by higher costs associated with our clinical laboratory expansion and the decline in revenues from existing drugs of abuse clients discussed above 
the margin improvement in was primarily attributable to increased revenues from additional testing volume through our existing infrastructure 
gross margin from product sales was in  down from in and in the decrease in primarily reflects a shift in sales mix of poct devices  with slowed growth of higher margin profile er devices in the hospital market and an increase in sales of lower margin sure screen devices in the government market 
in  margins were positively impacted by a shift in sales mix towards the higher margin poct devices and away from lower margin contract manufacturing services  which occurred during the first quarter of operating expenses year ended december vs vs of revenues of revenues of revenues change change change change operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues in  compared to million  or of revenues in and million  or in the increased spending in reflects an increase in sales and marketing expense and depreciation expense  partially offset by decreased performance based compensation 
the higher spending in over was primarily associated with increased sales and marketing and information technology expense 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in and increased to million in the decrease in was primarily due to the absence of costs incurred in related to the introduction of the medtoxscan reader and other peripheral materials related to the reader 
the increase in was primarily due to increased laboratory assay development expense in support of testing for clinical trials in our laboratory services segment 
the increase in was also driven by increased product development expense related to the introduction of the medtoxscan reader and other peripheral materials related to the reader  as well as continuing software development upgrades in our product sales segment 
other expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense  the net expenses associated with our building rental activities  and our investment gains losses 
these expenses increased to million in due primarily to an increase in the investment loss on our marketable equity securities held in trust 
other expense decreased to million in due to lower interest expense  reflecting a reduction in average debt levels 
income taxes in  we recorded million in income tax expense  or an effective rate of  compared to an effective rate of in and in the decrease in the effective rate in was primarily due to a million tax benefit including interest from the favorable resolution of an examination by the north carolina department of revenue of medtox diagnostics  inc liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements have been funded primarily by various combinations of profitable operations  cash received from debt financing  and the sale of equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this increase in compared to was primarily due to an improvement in our operating results with only a minimal corresponding cash payment of income taxes 
the increase in was partially offset by an increase in our trade receivables due to strong november and december  sales and the timing of cash receipts 
in january  we prepaid approximately  of the lease agreement for the office and research facilities leased from a director relating to leasehold improvements after determining that the prepayment would be financially beneficial to our company 
the prepayment was recorded as prepaid rent in other assets long term in the consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be amortized over the remaining life of the lease as additional rent 
net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of capital expenditures  was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures consisted of equipment purchased and costs incurred to continue to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs within our laboratory services and product sales businesses 
the significant increases in and reflect our investment in the expansion of our regional clinical laboratory capabilities 
in  we also invested in instrumentation and capacity in our clinical trials services business 
we expect equipment and capital improvement expenditures to be between million and million in  with increased investment in instrumentation and facility improvements in support of our growing clinical trials  regional clinical laboratory and workplace drugs of abuse business 
such expenditures are expected to be funded through cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was high in due to the refinancing of a portion of our mortgage loan in march see below 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock from officers of our company for a cost of million 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in the open market and  shares of our common stock from an officer and director of our company for a combined total cost of million 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in the open market at a cost of million 
the shares repurchased were placed in trust to fund our long term incentive plan 
in  the board of directors authorized up to million for the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deemed appropriate 
under this program  we repurchased  shares in  at a cost of million  which are being held in treasury 
on march   we entered into a term note the note with the wells fargo bank  national association the bank to refinance  on march   a portion of the outstanding balance of million on our mortgage loan with principal life insurance company principal 
we financed the march purchase of the building complex  where our laboratory services segment and other commercial tenants are located  with the mortgage loan from principal 
the mortgage loan had a term of ten years and was being repaid based on a year amortization schedule at a fixed interest rate of for the first five years 
in accordance with the provisions of the mortgage loan  principal had the option to adjust the interest rate  effective march   or to call the loan due on march  we elected not to accept the interest rate adjustment and refinanced million with the bank over a five year term in monthly installments of approximately  plus interest  commencing may  interest is calculated at either i a variable rate of below the prime rate or ii a fixed rate of above libor in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term 
in march  we paid the remaining outstanding mortgage loan balance of approximately million using approximately million of our line of credit as defined below and million of cash 
at december  and  we had an outstanding balance of million and million  respectively  on our note and no outstanding balance on our line of credit 
we are party to a credit security agreement the wells fargo credit agreement with the bank maturing on november  the wells fargo credit agreement  as amended  consists of i a revolving line of credit line of credit of up to million bearing interest at either a fluctuating rate of below the bank s prime rate or at a fixed rate of above libor  as defined and calculated by the bank  in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term  and ii a note or notes aggregating up to million loan limit for the purchase of capital equipment bearing interest at either a rate of below the bank s prime rate or at a fixed rate for a period of one  two  three  or four years at a rate of in excess of the then current yield on us treasury securities  adjusted to a constant maturity equal to such fixed rate period 
subject to certain conditions  the wells fargo credit agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit which  if drawn upon  would be deemed advances under the line of credit 
we are required to pay a fee equal to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the line of credit 
we have granted the bank a first priority security interest in all of the company s accounts receivable  other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory  and equipment to secure all indebtedness of the company to the bank 
extensions of credit under the wells fargo credit agreement are subject to certain conditions 
the wells fargo credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining  on a consolidated basis tangible net worth not less than  at any time  with tangible net worth defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity plus subordinated debt less any intangible assets 
total liabilities divided by tangible net worth not greater than to at any time  with total liabilities defined as the aggregate of current liabilities and non current liabilities less subordinated debt  and with tangible net worth as defined above 
a debt service coverage ratio not less than to as of each fiscal quarter end  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  with debt service coverage ratio defined as the aggregate of net income before non cash tax expense plus depreciation expense and amortization expense  divided by the aggregate of the current maturity of long term debt for the previous four fiscal quarters plus current capital lease obligations for the previous four fiscal quarters 
we are relying on expected positive cash flow from operations and our line of credit to fund our future working capital and asset purchases 
at december   we had total borrowing capacity of million on our line of credit 
we did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  in the short term  we believe that the aforementioned resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through while there can be no assurance that the available capital will be sufficient to fund our future operations beyond  we believe that future profitable operations  as well as access to additional capital through debt or equity financings  will be the primary means for funding our operations for the long term 
we continue to follow a plan which includes i aggressively monitoring and controlling costs  ii increasing revenues from sales of the our existing products and services  iii developing new products and services  as well as iv selectively pursuing synergistic acquisitions to increase our critical mass 
however  there can be no assurance that costs can be controlled  revenues can be increased  financing may be obtained  acquisitions successfully consummated  or that we will be profitable 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect the company s financial condition and liquidity position at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations amounts include interest payments based upon contractual or prevailing interest rates 
the table above excludes our obligation for future payments to participants under our supplemental executive retirement plan of approximately million at december  as the specific payment dates and amounts are unknown 
off balance sheet transactions we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices in our last three fiscal years has been primarily limited to salary  laboratory and operating supplies and rent increases and has historically not been material to our operations 
in the future  we may not be able to increase the prices of laboratory testing by an amount sufficient to cover the cost of inflation  although we are responding to these concerns by offering the highest quality products and services  delivered rapidly  priced competitively and supported by value added services for customers 
seasonality we believe that the laboratory testing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in pre employment screening 
these seasonal fluctuations include reduced volume in the year end holiday periods  and other major holidays 
in addition  inclement weather may have a negative impact on volume thereby reducing net revenues and cash flow 
impact of new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurement 
where applicable  sfas no 
simplifies and codifies fair value related guidance previously issued within generally accepted accounting principles 
although this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  its application may  for some entities  change current practice 
we adopted this statement as of january  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until january  we do not expect the adoption of fsp will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued staff position  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas no 
in cases where a market is not active 
fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of fsp did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january   however no assets or liabilities have currently been remeasured at fair value 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which changes how business acquisitions are accounted 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of this standard will  among other things  impact the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration  exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting  and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  in process research and development  indemnification assets  and tax benefits 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations and adjustments to an acquired entity s deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates 
during   and  we did not have sales denominated in foreign currencies nor did we have any subsidiaries located in foreign countries 
as such  we are not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  outstanding on a term note with wells fargo bank bearing interest at a variable rate of below the prime rate 
we have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted line of credit and long term debt with wells fargo bank due to its variable prime rate pricing 
at december   a change in the prime rate would increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows by less than million 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments or hedging transactions for trading or speculative purposes
