introduction and overview our business model is based primarily upon the design  development and sale of software that supports the wireless industry 
our products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world that support data communications through the use of mobile devices or other wireless communication devices such as pc cards  usb modems  and embedded modems in pcs 
our other mobility product lines are designed to improve the use of content management  personal information management  and to provide over the air updates to mobile devices 
wireless network providers and device manufacturers generally incorporate our products into their products sold directly to businesses and consumers or on servers in the network environment to facilitate the management for mobile devices and including firmware over the air updates 
our business is primarily dependent upon the demand for mobile communications solutions and the corresponding requirements for software solutions to support this demand 
during the last three years  demand for these types of products has increased as wireless providers compete to introduce higher network speeds  and launch new services that utilize these improving wireless broadband networks 
in addition  we have a strong consumer products business and we continue to invest in this area of the business 
we continue to invest in research and development and have built one of the industry s leading wireless product lines 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities as we leverage the strength of our technology capabilities with our growing global reach and expanding product lines

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we currently report our net revenues under two operating groups wireless and consumer 
within each of these groups software revenue is recognized based on the customer and contract type 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to oem customers or end users as completed products are shipped and titles passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements of sop no 
are met 
if the requirements of sop no 
are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
returns from oem customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  oem customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
management reviews available retail channel information and makes a determination of a return provision for sales made to distributors and retailers based on current channel inventory levels and historical return patterns 
certain sales to distributors or retailers are made on a consignment basis 
revenue for consignment sales are not recognized until sell through to the final customer is established 
within the consumer group certain revenues are booked net of revenue sharing payments  pursuant to the consensus of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we have a few multiple element agreements for which we have contracted to provide a perpetual license for use of proprietary software  to provide non recurring engineering  and in some cases to provide software maintenance post contract support 
for multiple element agreements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all contract elements is reviewed and the timing of the individual element revenue streams is determined and recognized consistent with sop no 
sales directly to end users are recognized upon delivery 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns are reasonably estimable and have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
sales incentives pursuant to the consensus of eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s product  effective january   the cost of sales incentives the company offers without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction is accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
we track incentives by program and use historical redemption rates to estimate the cost of customer incentives 
total sales incentives were   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents internal software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
the company considers technological feasibility to be established when all planning  designing  coding and testing has been completed according to design specifications 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized 
through december   software has been substantially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  and  accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 
capitalized software and amortization pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalize internally developed software and software purchased from third parties if the related software product under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the purchased software 
these costs are amortized on a product by product basis  typically over an estimated life of five to seven years  using the larger of the amount calculated using the straight line method or the amount calculated using the ratio between current period gross revenues and the total of current period gross revenues and estimated future gross revenues 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate on a product by product basis the unamortized capitalized cost of computer software compared to the net realizable value of that product 
the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceed its net realizable value is written off 
intangible assets and amortization amortization expense related to other intangibles acquired in acquisitions is calculated on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
certain assets acquired in the allume acquisition in had previously been amortized on a discounted cash flow basis through effective january   we changed to the straight line basis of amortization as these assets have been integrated into our core operations and as such it is no longer feasible to separate the cash flows generated by such assets to allow us to update the discounted cash flow analysis originally developed 
this change is classified as a change in estimate and will be accounted for on a prospective basis 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
the company has determined that there was no impairment at december  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of the adoption  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill was amortized over years 
this statement requires us to periodically assess the impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
these assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  
table of contents significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the intangible assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and the related amortization expense on our estimate of the useful life of the intangible assets 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the carrying value of our intangible assets and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate  in which case  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
our annual impairment testing date is december recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the fair value of its net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
at december   we elected to write off all goodwill associated with our services sector  or million 
the consulting portion of our services sector has been de emphasized and is no longer considered a strategic element of our go forward plan 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill at december  or estimates of reporting unit fair value are based upon market capitalization and therefore are volatile being sensitive to market fluctuations 
to the extent that our market capitalization decreases significantly or the allocation of value to our reporting units change  we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill

the operational expenses of our foreign entities reduce the currency exposure we have because our foreign currency revenues are offset in part by expenses payable in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not believe we have a material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations at this time
