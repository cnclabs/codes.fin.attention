forward looking statement warning certain statements included by reference in this filing containing the words could  may  believes  anticipates  intends  expects  and similar such words constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
any forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  our ability to maintain liquidity  our maintenance of patent protection  the impact of current litigation as it affects our costs as well as market access and the viability of our patents  our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  receive royalties from btmd  the impact of dramatic increases in demand  our ability to quickly increase capacity  our ability to access the market  our ability to maintain or lower production costs  our ability to continue to finance research and development as well as operations and expansion of production  the increased interest of larger market players  specifically bd  in providing devices to the safety market  and other factors referenced in item a 
risk factors 
given these uncertainties  undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements 
overview we have been manufacturing and marketing our products into the marketplace since we currently provide other safety medical products in addition to safety syringe products 
one such product  the patient safe syringe  which reduces the risk of infection resulting from iv line contamination  entered the market in safety syringes comprised of our sales in our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally through numerous distributors 
however  we have been blocked from access to the market by exclusive marketing practices engaged in by bd  who dominates the market 
we believe that its monopolistic business practices continue despite its paying million in to settle a prior lawsuit with us for anticompetitive practices  business disparagement  and tortious interference 
although we have made limited progress in some areas  such as the alternate care and international markets  our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our products  the federal and state legislation requiring the use of safe needle devices  and various senate subcommittee hearings on group purchasing organizations 
we continue to pursue various strategies to have better access to the hospital market  as well as other markets  including attempting to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  our innovative technology  introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
we are also marketing more 
table of contents product internationally 
beginning in  we were given an award from path to supply syringes to various african countries under the president s emergency plan for aids relief pepfar 
awards increased significantly from to the continuation of pepfar has been reauthorized by congress through however  funding for the procurement of safety syringes in this program is uncertain 
as a result of the introduction of vanishpoint syringes through the pepfar initiative  african countries have begun to procure products outside of the us funded program 
in  the director general of nigeria s national agency for food and drug administration and control nafdac  endorsed automated retraction syringes for use throughout nigeria 
we are currently selling syringes to a nigerian distributor for use in that country 
at the end of  the deputy prime minister of namibia also publically endorsed automated retraction syringes as a public intervention that would protect health workers and save their patient s lives 
additionally  an australian distributor was awarded a one year contract in march to supply our vanishpoint automated retraction syringes to all of queensland health s acute care facilities 
queensland health is a department within the government of queensland  australia 
the contract was renewed for an additional two years 
vanishpoint products are distributed in australia by brisbane based scientific educational supplies pty ltd 
the number of international distributors continues to increase 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access  the cash provided by the litigation settlements and generated from operations becomes insufficient and royalties from btmd are not forthcoming  we would take cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
we are focusing on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
we believe our current capitalization provides the resources necessary to implement some of these changes and improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  thereby reducing our unit cost 
product purchases from double dove  a chinese manufacturer  have enabled us to increase manufacturing capacity with little capital outlay and have provided a competitive manufactured cost 
double dove manufactured  in  approximately of the units we produced 
these purchases have improved profit margins in spite of limited revenues 
the cost of production per unit has generally declined as volumes increased 
double dove increased the prices in the fourth quarter of to us by per unit 
product cost reductions could be adversely affected by increased material and transportation costs 
we believe we could make up any long term disruption in these supplies by utilizing more of the capacity at the little elm facility  except for the cc insulin syringe  the cc and cc syringes and the autodisable syringe which altogether comprised about of our revenues 
we had a licensing agreement with btmd which expired on may  as a result of the expiration of the contract  we recognized  of prepaid royalty income in the second quarter of as other income 
royalties that were expected in and were not received due to the time needed to build the factory  assembly equipment  and the related infrastructure as well as the need of btmd to meet the requisite chinese government requirements 
the facility has been completed and btmd is in the process of meeting chinese government requirements 
we still continue to expect royalty payments although we are unable to predict the date we will begin to receive such royalties 
we should begin earning royalties once we have an effective agreement  chinese government requirements are met  and btmd is able to produce and sell products 
historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
with increased volumes  our manufacturing unit costs have generally tended to decline 
factors that could affect our unit costs  in addition to double dove s recent increase in unit costs of  include changing production volumes  costs of petroleum products  and transportation costs 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
we have substantially completed the expansion of an existing warehouse 
this expansion will increase our warehouse area  provide for additional office space  and add a second controlled environment 

table of contents liquidity and future capital requirements at the present time  management does not intend to raise equity capital 
due to the funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
historical sources of liquidity we have historically funded operations primarily from the proceeds from private placements  loans  and litigation settlements 
we were capitalized with approximately  raised from six separate private placement offerings 
we raised  in cash from the private sales of an aggregate of  shares of convertible preferred stock 
in addition  we obtained a cancellation of  in debt and  in accounts payable in exchange for series v class b convertible preferred stock 
we obtained  in from bank loans of which  has been repaid and  was refinanced with a new note for  with lewisville state bank  a division of st international bank 
additionally  we received a small business administration loan of  in to pay for portions of automated assembly equipment  multi cavity molds  and other equipment 
this loan has been repaid 
furthermore  we borrowed  in under our credit agreement with abbott 
in october we repaid the abbott note with proceeds from a new note from katie petroleum  inc for  and a portion of the proceeds from a private placement 
in  we received a construction line of credit for up to  to fund an expansion of our warehouse 
internal sources of liquidity margins and market access to achieve break even quarters  we need minimal access to hospital markets which has been difficult to obtain due to the monopolistic marketplace which was the subject of our initial lawsuit and now also included in our second lawsuit against bd 
we will continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  innovative technology  the introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
we are focusing on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
we believe our current capitalization provides the resources necessary to implement some of these changes and improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  thereby reducing our unit cost 
beginning in early  we began to receive shipment of product from double dove which enabled us to lower our unit costs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all as opposed to of our products in the us this could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production 
the mix of domestic and international sales affects the average sales price of our products 
generally  the higher the ratio of domestic sales to international sales  the higher the average sales price will be 
typically international sales are shipped directly from china to the customer 
purchases of product manufactured in china  if available  usually decrease the average cost of manufacture for all units as domestic costs  such as indirect labor and overhead  remain relatively constant 
double dove increased their prices to us by per unit in the fourth quarter of the number of units produced by the company versus manufactured in china can have a significant effect on the carrying costs of inventory as well as cost of sales 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriate mix of products manufactured domestically and those manufactured in china to achieve economic benefits as well as to maintain our domestic manufacturing capability 
currently  approximately of our products are produced domestically 
fluctuations in the cost of oil since our products are petroleum based and transportation and the volume of units purchased from double dove may have an impact on the unit costs of our product 

table of contents increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
reductions in oil prices may not quickly affect petroleum product prices 
seasonality historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
licensing agreement we had a licensing agreement with btmd which expired on may  as a result of the expiration of the contract  we recognized  of prepaid royalty income in the second quarter of as other income 
royalties that were expected in and were not received due to the time needed to build the factory  assembly equipment  and the related infrastructure as well as the need of btmd to meet the requisite chinese government requirements

we still continue to expect royalty payments  although we are unable to predict the date we will begin to receive such royalties 
we should begin earning royalties once we have an effective agreement  chinese government requirements are met  and btmd is able to produce and sell products 
cash requirements due to funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and cash generated from operations becomes insufficient to support operations  we would take cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
external sources of liquidity we have obtained several loans from our inception  which have  together with the proceeds from the sales of equities and litigation efforts  enabled us to pursue development and production of our products 
given the current economic conditions  our ability to obtain additional funds through loans is uncertain 
furthermore  the shareholders previously authorized an additional  shares of a class c preferred stock that could  if necessary  be designated and used to raise funds through the sale of equity 
due to the current market price of our common stock  it is unlikely we would choose to raise funds by the sale of equity 
capital resources in  we invested  in a limited liability company llc 
we exercised our option and our funds were returned in material commitments for expenditures we have substantially completed expansion of our warehouse including additional warehouse space  additional office space  and a new controlled environment 
we are funding this expansion with a construction line of credit from lewisville state bank  a division of st international bank  for approximately million  secured by a second lien deed on the land and existing buildings 
draws under the construction line of credit  which have totaled approximately million at the end of the year  are expected to be replaced by permanent financing in the second quarter of 
table of contents trends in capital resources interest expense will increase due to the recent loan of approximately million  but will be somewhat mitigated by lower borrowing rates if current conditions in the credit markets continue 
interest income may be negatively affected by lower interest rates and our prior movement of cash to us treasury bills and other us government backed securities 
although we believe that we have granted credit to credit worthy firms  current economic conditions may affect the timing and or collectability of some accounts 
results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from our historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
all period references are to our fiscal years ended december  or dollar amounts have been rounded for ease of reading 
comparison of year ended december   and year ended december  revenues increased  due principally to higher average sales prices and greater volumes 
domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder

unit sales of all products increased 
domestic unit sales as well as average sales prices increased 
international unit sales and average selling prices declined 
sales to one distributor accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
cost of sales increased due to higher manufacturing costs and higher volumes 
royalty expenses were higher due to an increase in gross revenues 
as a result  gross profit margins declined from in to in operating expenses increased from the prior year due to higher general and administrative expenses mitigated by lower sales and marketing and research and development costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased due primarily to reduced travel and entertainment  trade shows and market expense  compensation and office supplies 
consulting expense also decreased 
research and development costs were flat 
we had decreases in engineering costs due principally to higher costs of validation and engineering samples offset by higher compensation costs 
general and administrative costs increased due principally to increased legal costs including a settlement of litigation whereby we obtained a patent license assignment  office expenses  compensation  property taxes and freight costs 
travel and entertainment costs and fees to distributors decreased 
preferred stock dividend requirements decreased due to conversion of preferred stock to common stock 
the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately million

we had recognized million in cumulative discount reimbursements by the third quarter of sales to three distributors accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to higher volumes offset by the lower average selling price principally in the international sales 
the increased volume of production resulted in a lower unit cost 
royalty expenses were flat

general and administrative costs increased due principally to higher legal expenses 
compensation costs  outside accounting costs  and distribution fees also increased 
stock option expenses  shareholder expenses  consulting and training decreased 
legal costs concerning the litigation against bd comprise the largest amount of legal fees and have a significant effect on our expenses 
our lawsuit against bd is currently scheduled for trial in october after conclusion of the trial  legal expenses are expected to decrease significantly 
the legal costs incurred in with regard to the abbott litigation are lower than those in we expect such costs to continue until the litigation is resolved 
we also have higher litigation expenses concerning omi 
we had decreases in taxes other than income taxes in we awarded merit increases to our employees in we donated product in an international humanitarian effort in there have been no stock options awarded since  therefore  this expense continues to decline as the costs become fully amortized with virtually none recorded in we also increased our allowance for bad debt

the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and cash balances 
interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates and debt balances 
provision for income tax benefits consists primarily of the settlement in our favor of a state tax audit 
we also have a valuation reserve for all deferred taxes  with the exception of deferred taxes on the beneficial conversion feature associated with our note payable to katie petroleum 
cash flow from operations was negative for due principally to the loss for the year 
the effect of non cash expenses and the change in working capital were a positive million

contractual obligations contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following chart summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for long term debt as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current maturities the presentation of contractual obligations of long term debt includes assumptions regarding our ability to replace a construction loan with permanent financing 
significant accounting policies we consider the following to be our most significant accounting policies 
careful consideration and review is given to these and all accounting policies on a routine basis to ensure that they are accurately and consistently applied 
accounts receivable we record trade receivables when revenue is recognized 
no product has been consigned to customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables 
those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance 
an additional allowance has been established based on a percentage of receivables outstanding 
these provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible 
trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for sales to distributors when title and risk of ownership passes to the distributor  generally upon shipment 
revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors  less contractual pricing allowances 
contractual pricing allowances consist of i rebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show  among other things  the facility that purchased the products  and ii a provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products that we have not received tracking reports 
rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customer s receivable balance 
the provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report 
additionally  if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors  the provision is further adjusted 
the estimated contractual allowance is netted against individual distributors accounts receivable balances for financial reporting purposes 
the resulting net balance is reflected in accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
the terms and conditions of contractual pricing allowances are governed by contracts between us and our distributors 
revenue for shipments directly to end users is recognized when title and risk of ownership passes from us 
any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed 

table of contents our domestic return policy is set forth in our standard distribution agreement 
this policy provides that a customer may return incorrect shipments within days following arrival at the distributor s facility 
in all such cases the distributor must obtain an authorization code from us and affix the code to the returned product 
we will not accept returned goods without a returned goods authorization number 
we may refund the customer s money or replace the product 
our return policy also provides that a customer may return product that is overstocked 
overstocking returns are limited to two times in each month period up to one percent of distributor s total purchase of products for the prior month period 
all product overstocks and returns are subject to inspection and acceptance by manufacturer 
our international distribution agreements do not provide for any returns 
we record an allowance for estimated returns as a reduction to accounts receivable and gross sales 
historically  returns have been less than of total sales 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
a reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories 
marketing fees under a sales and marketing agreement with abbott  we paid marketing fees until we terminated the contract for breach 
the contracted services were to include participation in promotional activities  development of educational and promotional materials  representation at trade shows  clinical demonstrations  inservicing and training  and tracking reports detailing the placement of our products to end users 
marketing fees were accrued at the time of the sale of product to abbott 
these fees were paid after abbott provided us a tracking report of product sales to end users 
these costs were included in sales and marketing expense in the statements of operations 
no marketing fees have been accrued since october   the date the national marketing and distribution agreement with abbott was terminated 
we filed suit against abbott in august for breach of contract 
we do not expect the eventual liability for marketing fees  if any  to exceed the amount accrued 
reimbursed discounts we received reimbursed discounts from one of the settlement agreements reached in our previous federal antitrust lawsuit  retractable technologies  inc v 
bd  et al 
payments under the discount reimbursement program were recognized upon invoicing of amounts due under the agreement  provided collection was reasonably assured 
such amounts are presented in the statements of operations as a separate component of revenues 
all funds available under the discount reimbursement program were recognized by the third quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures regarding our cash and cash equivalents are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes 
we shifted the bulk of our funds into us treasury bills and other us government backed securities in april additionally  reasonable  possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings
