revisions to financial statement presentation 
we have revised our consolidated balance sheet as of october  to correct an error in the classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
this revision does not impact the consolidated statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows for any period 
during the april  quarter end process  we noted that the october  us deferred tax valuation allowances and certain deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities were misclassified on the balance sheet as a result of improperly applying the jurisdictional netting rules 
we have therefore revised our balance sheet as of october  by decreasing other long term liabilities by million and decreasing other long term assets by million  decreasing other current assets by million and increasing other accrued liabilities by million 
fasb accounting standards codification 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb introduced the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  the codification or asc 
the codification  which was launched on july   became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap  superseding existing literature issued by fasb  american institute of certified public accountants  emerging issues task force and other related literature 
the codification eliminates the gaap hierarchy and establishes one level of authoritative guidance for gaap 
all other literature is considered non authoritative 
the codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  we have adopted the codification in the quarter ending october  and provided the appropriate references to the codification  where appropriate 
there has been no change to our financial statements due to the implementation of the codification 
overview and executive summary agilent is the world s premier measurement company  providing core electronic and bio analytical measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 

table of contents in the first fiscal quarter of  we formed a new operating segment from our existing businesses the semiconductor and board test segment 
the new segment covers semiconductor equipment and services sold to semiconductor manufacturing and printed circuit board assembly customers 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we moved microscopy measurement from the bio analytical measurement segment to the electronic measurement segment 
all historical segment numbers have been recast to conform to this reporting structure in our financial statements 
the agilent business is comprised of the electronic measurement business  the bio analytical measurement business and the semiconductor and board test business 
our fiscal year end is october unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
agilent s net revenue in was  million  a decrease of percent when compared to foreign currency movements accounted for percentage points of revenue decline in compared to bio analytical measurement revenues decreased percent in compared to last year with foreign currency movements accounting for percentage points of revenue decline 
within bio analytical measurement  life sciences revenues declined percent in compared to with declines in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets and a modest increase in demand within the academic and government research markets 
also within bio analytical measurement  chemical analysis revenues declined percent compared to with the food safety market showing strength throughout the year  but other markets down compared to last year 
electronic measurement revenues decreased percent in when compared to within electronic measurement  revenues in general purpose test decreased percent when compared to last year with aerospace and defense markets declining moderately and semiconductor related markets remaining depressed 
also within electronic measurement  communications test markets were particularly weak and fell percent in compared to our semiconductor and board test business continued to experience depressed market conditions in and revenue declined percent compared to agilent s total net revenue in increased percent in comparison to foreign currency movements accounted for percentage points of revenue growth in when compared to and a further percentage point increase in revenue was attributable to acquisitions in when compared to net loss was million in and net income of million in and million in in  and we generated operating cash flows of million  million and million  respectively 
as of october  and we had cash and cash equivalents balances of  million and  million  respectively 
we announced restructuring activities in december  february and march in response to the deterioration of economic conditions 
the restructuring activities were combined under a single restructuring plan the fy plan and are part of a series of actions taken by agilent in response to the current economic situation 
in connection with the combined restructuring plan  we expect to record in aggregate approximately million in pre tax restructuring and other charges related to business and infrastructure cost reduction 
total restructuring and other special charges of million have been incurred in the year ended october  with respect to these actions 
a significant portion of these charges has resulted and will continue to result in cash expenditures 
when completed  these actions together are expected to result in future annual operating savings of approximately million and workforce reductions of approximately  regular positions 
we completed the majority of these activities related to the fy plan by october  with the remainder expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal as of october  approximately employees within electronic measurment are pending termination under the fy plan 

table of contents on july   agilent  varian  inc varian  and cobalt acquisition corp  a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of agilent  entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  varian would become a wholly owned subsidiary of agilent 
varian is a leading worldwide supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications 
the estimated billion total purchase price of varian includes cash per share of varian s common stock  the cashing out of in the money stock options after acceleration and assumed debt 
the transaction has been approved by shareholders of varian and is expected to be completed after achieving customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals 
we may finance the purchase price of varian using a portion of the proceeds from our september offering of senior notes and other existing cash 
on october  we completed the sale of our data networks product line dnpl to ixia nasdaq xxia for million in cash 
dnpl comprises the nx family of products for next generation internet protocol ip performance testing 
ixia is a leading provider of converged ip performance test systems and service verification platforms for wireless and wired infrastructures 
we recorded the gain on this divestiture in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
looking forward  we have seen signs that our businesses may have reached the bottom of the economic downturn 
we remain committed to delivering performance consistent with agilent s operating model 
we have announced that starting in the first quarter of  agilent will report in the following three segments electronic measurement  chemical analysis and life sciences 
the electronic measurement segment will recombine electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test  which were reported separately in see segment reporting changes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  investment impairments  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  restructuring and asset impairment charges and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period 
table of contents or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value or vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for software to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
investment impairments 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our equity and debt securities and our cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
share based compensation 
we account for share based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under the authoritative guidance  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value which generally uses the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis 
our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
we consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted  which we believe is representative of future behavior 
in and we used implied volatility of agilent s publicly traded  similar priced stock options to estimate the expected stock price volatility assumption for employee stock option awards 
in  we moved to historical volatility of agilent s stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life 
in reaching this conclusion  we have considered many factors including the extent to which our options are currently traded and our ability to find traded options in the current market with similar terms and prices to the options we are valuing 
a percent increase in our estimated volatility from percent to percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately percent if no other factors were changed 
in the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the expected life of our employee stock options from years to years 
in revising this estimate  we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our employees 
in the first quarter of  we granted the majority of our employee stock options to executive employees and the review of our data indicated that our executive 
table of contents employees  on average  exercise their options at years 
see note  share based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover  retiree mortality rates  and portfolio composition 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date october for both us and us plans 
the us discount rates were determined by matching the expected plan benefit payments against an industry discount curve 
the discount rate decreased significantly over the prior year from percent to percent due to lower bond yields 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and either remained unchanged or decreased 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns 
plan assets are valued at fair value 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on plan assets for would result in a million impact on us pension expense and a million impact on non us pension expense 
the net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs recorded in operations excluding curtailments and settlements were million in  million in  and million in goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
agilent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as defined in the authoritative guidance  a reporting unit is an operating segment  or one level below an operating segment 
we have aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units 
we have three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes electronic measurement  bio analytical measurement  and semiconductor and board test 
we test goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment  as our businesses operate in a number of markets and geographical regions 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the 
table of contents fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  which are formed by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization  taking into account an appropriate control premium 
we then compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the fair value calculations based on the income approach 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments 
the assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
changes in these assumptions based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
the circumstances that could trigger a goodwill impairment could include  but are not limited to  the following items to the extent that management believes the occurrence of one or more would make it more likely than not that we would fail step of the goodwill impairment test significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  a portion of a reporting unit s goodwill has been included in the carrying amounts of a business that will be disposed or if our market capitalization is below our net book value 
we have considered the negative effects of the current downturn in the business environment in evaluating whether we should perform interim goodwill impairment testing 
due to the significant business downturn in the semiconductor and board test reporting unit  we performed step of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of and determined that there was no impairment at that time 
the results of our test for goodwill impairment  as of september   showed that the estimated fair values of our electronic measurement  bio analytical measurement  and semiconductor and board test reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
a percent increase in the discount rate lowered the fair value by approximately percent 
there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended october  we continue to assess the overall environment to determine if we would trigger and fail step of the goodwill impairment test 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we performed an impairment analysis of purchased intangible assets in and recorded million of impairment charges primarily related to divested businesses 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the four main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities  asset impairments and special charges related to inventory 
workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities generally when we have vacated the premises 
these estimates were derived using the authoritative accounting guidance 
we have also assessed the recoverability of our long lived assets  by determining 
table of contents whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell 
the charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and reserves taken against inventory on hand 
if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we consider evidence such as our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
at october   we provided partial valuation allowances for our us deferred tax assets and full or partial valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of a valuation allowance in a given taxing jurisdiction 
we have not provided for all us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model  the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
adoption of new pronouncements see note  new accounting pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 
restructuring costs  asset impairments and other charges in december  we announced the fy plan 
initially  we expected to reduce our annual operating expenses by reducing approximately positions of the global workforce of regular employees 
in february  we announced we had expanded the fy plan to include actions to 
table of contents exit the inspection businesses in our semiconductor and board test segment and to restructure our global infrastructure organization 
in march  we announced that the fy plan had been expanded further to restructure our electronic measurement and semiconductor and board test segments in response to the continuing deterioration of economic conditions 
under the fy plan  we expect to record in aggregate approximately million in pre tax restructuring and other charges related to business and infrastructure cost reduction 
we expect that a significant proportion of these charges will result in cash expenditures 
when completed  these actions together are expected to result in annual operating savings of approximately million and workforce reductions of approximately  regular positions 
total restructuring and other special charges of million have been incurred in the year ended october  with respect to these actions 
of the million  million related to asset impairments and million related to special charges for excess inventory as a result of exiting the inspection businesses in our semiconductor and board test segment and other excess inventory charges incurred as part of our restructuring of the electronic measurement businesses 
we completed the majority of these activities related to the fy plan by october  with the remainder expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal as of october  approximately employees within electronic measurement are pending termination under the fy plan 
as a result of these actions  the average future working lifetime of the employees remaining in our retirement and post retirement benefit plans decreased and accordingly  we recorded a million net curtailment gain in the year ended october  foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge revenues  expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short term basis rolling twelve month period 
therefore  we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term

services and other revenue increased percent in compared to bio analytical measurement revenues decreased percent in when compared to with decreases in both life sciences and chemical analysis businesses of percent and percent  respectively 
within life sciences  we saw modest growth in revenue in the academic and government markets  but weakness in pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets 
within chemical analysis  all markets recorded revenue decreases in when compared to with the exception of food safety which reported strong results driven by analysis of contaminated foods and worldwide regulatory efforts 
electronic measurement revenues decreased percent in when compared to with sustained weakness in general purpose and communication test down percent and percent  respectively 
within general purpose test  the aerospace and defense market showed signs of recovery toward the end of  but other markets remained difficult and demand declined over the year 
communication test revenues were depressed throughout the year across all markets when compared to the semiconductor and board test business reported a decline in revenues of percent in when compared to as markets declined markedly 
backlog on october   our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at october  on 
table of contents october   our unfilled orders for the bio analytical measurement business were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at october  within our semiconductor and board test business our unfilled orders were approximately million on october  as compared to approximately million at october  we expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months 
on average  our unfilled orders represent approximately two months worth of revenues 
in light of this experience  backlog on any particular date  while indicative of short term revenue performance  is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long term revenue performance

operating margins in decreased percentage points as compared to in january  we implemented wage reductions across the company in response to deteriorating economic conditions 
those payroll reductions resulted in cash savings of approximately million in and were fully restored to all employees effective november  research and development expenditures have decreased percent in compared to a net decrease in expenses after incurring restructuring costs was attributable to lower variable pay and wage reductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percent during the year 
the net decrease in expenses after incurring restructuring costs was due to the expense controls we have implemented  and in particular  lower variable pay  wage reductions and reduced commissions 
gross inventory charges were million in  million in and million in sales of previously written down inventory were million in  million in and million in our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
we conduct five types of research and development basic research  which contributes to the fundamental understanding of areas critical to our future  foundation technologies  which enables fundamental advances across all businesses  communications  which creates technologies to enable pervasive access to information  life sciences  which enables next generation pharmaceuticals and improved patient outcomes  and measurement  which provides critical advances in test and measurement electronics and systems 
our research seeks to improve on various technical 
table of contents competencies in electronics such as compound semiconductor devices  digital imaging systems and microfabrication technologies  software  systems and solutions such as applied mathematics  knowledge management and measurement science  life sciences such as computational biology  molecular diagnostics and high throughput measurements  and photonics  such as precision automation technology  optical switching and high speed optical links 
in each of these research fields  we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time horizon 
some of our product development research is designed to improve on the more than  products already in production  other research is on major new product releases  and yet other focused on developing new product segments for the future 
due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses  there are a number of drivers of this expense 
net loss in was million 
net income in and was million and million  respectively 
at october   our headcount was approximately  compared to  in and  in provision for income taxes years ended october  in millions provision for income taxes for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on operations 
the percent operations tax rate reflects that our structure has a fixed component of tax and that on reduced profitability unusual tax rate results 
the tax rate also includes tax on earnings in jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
in addition  net tax benefits totaling million relating primarily to the lapses of statutes of limitations and tax settlements in foreign jurisdictions are incorporated in the rate 
without considering interest and penalties  the rate reflects taxes in all jurisdictions except the us and foreign jurisdictions in which income tax expense or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to valuation allowances 
we intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on operations 
the percent operations tax rate includes a beneficial release of a portion of the us federal and state valuation allowances which results in us tax expense of nearly zero 
it also includes tax on earnings in other jurisdictions that have low effective tax rates 
without considering interest and penalties  the provision for taxes was recorded for income generated in jurisdictions other than the netherlands  puerto rico  switzerland  the us  and the us where we have recorded valuation allowances 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on operations 
the percent operations tax rate reflects taxes at an effective tax rate of zero in the us due to a release of a significant portion of the valuation allowance and at low effective tax rates in other jurisdictions 
the low operations tax rate includes a benefit of million related to valuation allowance adjustments based on changes in other comprehensive income items  portions of which are attributable to increases in currency translation adjustments and to increases in the value of certain stock investments 
in addition  the tax rate includes benefits totaling million related to the resolution of primarily non us tax issues associated with the spin off of agilent from hewlett packard 

table of contents agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions  most significantly in singapore  malaysia and switzerland 
the tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions 
as a result of the incentives  the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share diluted was approximately  and in  and  respectively 
during  we established valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets of the us and certain entities in foreign jurisdictions 
the valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
during  we concluded that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our us federal deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance 
during  we maintained a partial us federal valuation allowance and concluded that a significant portion of our us state deferred tax assets would be realized and reversed a portion of the valuation allowance 
in  the valuation allowance increased substantially as a result of changes to other comprehensive income related taxes for pensions  certain mark to market investments  currency translation adjustments and an increase in the amount of foreign tax credits 
during  we continued to maintain the partial valuation allowances for us federal and state deferred tax assets 
in  the valuation allowance increased over the prior year reflecting an offset of an increase in the gross deferred tax liability for other comprehensive income and the increases of the gross deferred tax assets for losses incurred and other operating timing items 
the valuation allowance increases are primarily associated with the us and us we intend to maintain partial or full valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of a valuation allowance in a given taxing jurisdiction 
cumulative losses incurred by certain entities in foreign jurisdictions in recent years represent sufficient negative evidence to require maintaining full valuation allowances 
in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  for all us and other tax jurisdictions  we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would be required 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
our us federal income tax returns for through have been or are under audit by the internal revenue service irs 
in august  we received a revenue agent s report rar for through the rar proposed many adjustments to taxable income 
one adjustment  however  which deals with the use of agilent s brand name by our foreign affiliates accounts for the majority of the proposed adjustments 
in august of  this brand name issue was resolved with no adjustments made to agilent s taxable income 
we continue to meet with the appeals office of the irs in order to resolve the remaining issues associated with the rar s proposed adjustments 
we are uncertain as to how and when these issues will be finally resolved 
it may take several years 
we believe that any required adjustments however will be more than offset by applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits 
based on current information  we believe that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents global infrastructure organization our global infrastructure organization gio remains a key component of our operating model 
gio  which includes it  workplace services  hr  legal and finance  has reduced expense levels this year while delivering infrastructure support to business operations 
in response to deteriorating economic conditions earlier this year  we announced a gio restructuring program in february the results of this program brought gio workforce to a more appropriate size and structure for the current economic realities of our business 
all of the actions associated with the restructuring of our gio have now been taken and are complete 
our global infrastructure costs decreased by percent year over year compared to gio passes these costs on to our businesses based on their usage of the services provided 
gio has scaled down its staffing over several years  reducing the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance  it and workplace services and moved many of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions or external service providers 
the global infrastructure organization ended with approximately  employees  a decline of employees from one year ago and a decline of employees from two years ago 
segment overview agilent is a measurement company providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
in the first fiscal quarter of  we formed a new operating segment from our existing businesses the semiconductor and board test segment 
the segment covers semiconductor equipment and services sold to semiconductor manufacturing and printer circuit board assembly customers

general purpose test revenues of  million  representing approximately percent of electronic measurement revenues  declined percent in compared to within general purpose test  all market segments declined with relative strength in aerospace and defense offset by steeper declines in computer and semiconductor and other general purpose test business 
government demand in aerospace and defense was stable  particularly in homeland security related applications for surveillance and intelligence 
weakness persisted in the computer and semiconductor measurement markets due to continued capital spending contraction in both r d and manufacturing applications 
other general purpose test markets were weak with particular softness in electronic manufacturing and automotive markets 
quarterly year on year rates of decline in general purpose end markets have slowed in the second half of the year  but revenue remained down significantly from communications test revenues of million  representing approximately percent of electronic measurement revenues  declined percent compared to the same period last year 
all communications test end markets experienced double digit declines compared to the wireless r d market  as well as the electronic design automation market  performed better than other submarkets as r d investment continues for high speed applications  as well as pre conformance and interoperability test solutions  particularly for long term evolution an emerging wireless standard 
investment in next generation technology in china increased in the second half of the year 
wireless manufacturing markets declined significantly versus a peak in the second half of as handset market capacity expansion is limited primarily to smart phones 
capital spending remains limited in the other communications test submarkets 
network equipment manufacturing nem business declined due to the continued consolidation in the network operator and service provider markets 
nem business remains soft with the majority of investment focused only on critical r d spending for new technologies  which led to declines in the broadband r d and manufacturing market versus a strong year over year compare 
looking forward  while some indications of stabilization and improvement in our electronics measurement markets exist  we expect any recovery to be gradual in the near term due to on going market uncertainty

table of contents on may   we entered into a five year credit agreement  which provides for a million unsecured credit facility that will expire on may  the company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes 
on september   we entered into an accession agreement  increasing the credit facility from million to million 
the company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes 
as of october  the company has no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
on august  the credit agreement was amended to provide additional financing flexibility in advance of the pending acquisition of varian  inc the amendment allows for up to billion of additional indebtedness  incurred during the period from august  through the closing of the acquisition  to be excluded from the leverage ratio covenant until the later of the first day of the month following the ninth full calendar month after the closing of the acquisition or august   it also temporarily reduces the basket for other secured financing we are permitted to incur from million to million during this period

off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
see note commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax 
table of contents and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october  for operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments retirement plans total operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was million  compared to same amount as of october  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other purchase commitments 
these relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers 
purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a day period without significant penalties 
retirement plans 
commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our us and non us defined benefit plans and to our post retirement medical plans 
we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in  percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
