manufacturing and supply we made treprostinil sodium  the active ingredient for remodulin and inhaled treprostinil  and treprostinil diethanolamine  the active ingredient for oral treprostinil  at our manufacturing facility in chicago  illinois  until march at which time we transitioned these activities to our new laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
in july  we submitted an application to the fda for approval of the new facility for commercial manufacturing  and we expect to receive approval in the first half of until we receive fda approval  we cannot use or sell commercially any products manufactured in our silver spring facility 
we currently maintain an inventory of formulated remodulin that will meet over two years of expected demand 
with the transfer of our manufacturing operations to our silver spring facility  we have also changed our internal manufacturing process 
when we began  we produced treprostinil sodium starting with basic chemicals and completed the full manufacturing process 
over the last several years  we have been modifying the manufacturing process to begin with advanced intermediate compounds made by outside vendors 
we anticipate that  upon commercialization of oral treprostinil  the need for treprostinil diethanolamine will be greater than the need for treprostinil sodium 
by beginning the manufacturing process with the advanced intermediate compound  we are able to make treprostinil diethanolamine and then convert that compound to treprostinil sodium as needed 
we believe this process will give us the most flexibility and efficiency in meeting future demands for both forms of treprostinil 
we have approved three vendors to supply the advanced intermediate compounds in order to reduce the risk of supply shortages 
baxter healthcare corporation baxter formulates the active ingredient we manufacture into remodulin for us 
the term of our initial agreement with baxter ended in october the agreement is renewable for successive eighteen month terms and has been continuously renewed since october in late  baxter gave us verbal notice that it does not intend to renew our agreement upon the expiration of its current term in late october we eventually intend to formulate remodulin ourselves in the combination office and laboratory facility that we are currently constructing adjacent to our silver spring laboratory facility 
in the meantime  we intend to engage another third party to formulate remodulin prior to the termination of our agreement with baxter to serve as a secondary manufacturer 
also  although we maintain a two year inventory of remodulin  we believe that engaging a third party formulator will mitigate the risk that we might not be able to formulate sufficient quantities of remodulin to meet patient demand 
in addition  we expect to increase contingent inventory levels of formulated remodulin from an approximate two year supply to a three year supply based on projected demand 
we rely on catalent pharma solutions  inc formerly cardinal health  inc catalent to conduct stability studies on remodulin  formulate inhaled treprostinil  formulate oral treprostinil for clinical trials and to analyze other products we develop 
we expect to begin manufacturing oral treprostinil in our new manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina  during the second half of 
table of contents in  we anticipate commencing commercial development of the f and h antibodies licensed from mskcc at our silver spring  maryland  facility 
we expect that we will be able to utilize much of the equipment that we obtained for the ovarex manufacturing process for f and h antibody development 
our telemedicine products are currently manufactured by winland electronics  inc prior to  our telemedicine products were made by msi of florida  inc although we believe that other manufacturers and suppliers could provide similar products  services and materials  there are few companies that could replace these manufacturers and suppliers 
a change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacture  distribution and research efforts associated with our respective products or result in increased costs

competition many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular and infectious diseases and cancer 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and the rest of the world  including the following flolan 
the first product approved by the fda for treating pah  flolan is a prostacyclin analogue that is delivered by intravenous infusion 
glaxo began marketing flolan in the united states in in  myogen  inc myogen acquired the marketing rights from glaxo for flolan in the united states 
in november  myogen was acquired by gilead sciences  inc gilead 
the generic exclusivity period for flolan expired in april  generic epoprostenol 
in april  teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
teva announced that the fda approved its version of generic epoprostenol for the treatment of pah 
this is the first approved generic version of flolan 
in june  generamedix inc generamedix received fda approval for its version of generic epoprostenol  which is stable at room temperature 
in february  actelion announced that it had entered into an agreement with generamedix to acquire its generic epoprostenol product  ventavis 
approved in december in the united states and in september in europe  ventavis is the only prostacyclin analogue that has been approved for inhalation 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  inc cotherix in the united states and is marketed by schering ag in europe as iloprost 
in january  cotherix was acquired by actelion  the manufacturer and distributor of tracleer  tracleer 
the first oral drug to be approved for pah  tracleer is also the first drug in its class  known as eras 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and in may in europe 
tracleer is marketed worldwide by actelion  revatio 
approved in june in the united states  revatio is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer inc revatio contains sildenafil  the same active ingredient as viagra  and is the first pde inhibitor  to be approved for pah  letairis 
approved in june in the united states  letairis is an oral therapy marketed by gilead for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer  letairis is an era 
in april  glaxo received marketing authorization from the emea for letairis in europe where it is known as volibris  and 
table of contents thelin 
approved in august in the eu  thelin is an oral therapy  which was developed and initially marketed in europe by encysive pharmaceuticals inc encysive  for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer and letairis  thelin is an era 
in june  pfizer completed its acquisition of encysive 
pfizer has stated that it plans to conduct a pivotal phase iii clinical trial to support registration of thelin in the united states and eventually seek fda approval 
due to their ease of use  oral therapies  such as tracleer and revatio  are generally considered front line therapies for newly diagnosed pah patients 
flolan and remodulin  more complex infusion therapies  are generally considered later stage therapies for sicker patients 
the use of the available oral therapies and ventavis  either alone or in combination  will delay the need for infusion therapy for many patients 
as a result  while we may not currently compete head to head with these drugs as front line therapy  the success of their use affects our commercial operations 
as we develop both inhaled and oral treprostinil therapies  we will be expanding our range of therapeutics to include front line and mid range treatment options 
furthermore  the commercialization of generic forms of other approved pah therapies may exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we may not successfully compete with established drugs  products and the companies that develop and market them holter and event monitoring analysis services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
we compete with all of these companies for customers  funding  access to licenses  personnel  third party collaborators  product development and commercialization 
almost all of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  product development and marketing  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we have 
governmental regulation the research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated by governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda in the united states  the emea in the eu and similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
the steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  which are similar to steps required in most other countries  include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals  formulation studies and the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application ind for a new drug  clinical studies in healthy volunteers  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of an nda to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
a day waiting period after the filing of each ind is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  the fda may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until it authorizes trials under specified terms 
the ind process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay development of our products 
moreover  positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials 

table of contents clinical trials in support of an nda are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
during phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess its effects on bodily functions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  then phase iii trials  also called pivotal studies  major studies or advanced clinical trials  are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically diverse clinical study sites 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  an nda or a biologics license application is typically submitted to the fda in the united states  and an maa is typically submitted to the emea in the eu 
the regulatory authorities may request additional information before accepting an application  in which case the application must be resubmitted with the additional information 
once the application has been accepted  the regulatory authority reviews the application and responds to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by requests from regulatory authorities for additional information or clarification 
in the united states  the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether it should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
the regulatory authorities may also inspect the manufacturing facility before approving an application 
in the united states  if fda evaluations of the application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter 
a complete response letter will usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and authorization of commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
at the request of an applicant  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug in the united states if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition 
a disease or condition is considered rare if it affects fewer than  people in the united states 
if an applicant obtains the first fda marketing approval for a certain orphan drug  the applicant will have a seven year exclusive right as against generic versions to market the drug for the orphan indication 
the fda has approved the orphan designation for treprostinil for the treatment of pah without regard to drug product formulation 
we believe that the orphan designation of treprostinil includes all types of pah  regardless of etiology 
however  such designation does not preclude us from seeking orphan drug designation for other formulations of treprostinil or for other etiologies of pah or medically plausible subsets of pah  and does not preclude the fda from granting a new seven year period of orphan drug exclusivity upon the approval of an nda for a new formulation of treprostinil for the designated new indication  provided we demonstrate that such new formulation is clinically superior to the older formulation of parenteral remodulin 
subcutaneous remodulin was approved by the fda for the treatment of pah in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise  and intravenous remodulin was approved for those patients not able to tolerate subcutaneous infusion 
if regulatory approval of our other products is granted  such approvals will similarly be limited to certain disease states or conditions 
the manufacturers of approved products and their manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
furthermore  identification of certain side effects or the occurrence of manufacturing problems after a drug is on the market could cause subsequent 
table of contents withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials  and changes in labeling of the product 
the hatch waxman act provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the fda regulatory review period for the product 
this extension period would generally be one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of an nda  plus all of the time between the submission date of an nda and its approval  subject to a maximum extension of five years 
similar patent term extensions are available under european laws 
following fda approval  we filed a patent term extension application with the united states patent and trademark office for our patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin 
the application was approved in february  and the patent for remodulin is currently set to expire on october  outside of the united states  our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although  within europe  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one eu member state 
in the eu  marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized body or through a decentralized or a national level process 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and high technology products and is available at the applicant s option for other products 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member countries 
the decentralized procedure is available for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions  changes existing procedures for national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu actions on products  suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more eu member countries  certify that the dossier is identical to that on which the first approval was based  or explain any differences and certify that identical dossiers are being submitted to all eu member countries for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each eu member country must decide whether to recognize approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
lack of objection of a given country within days automatically results in approval in that country 
following receipt of marketing authorization in an eu member country  the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate prescription pricing authority in that country 
commercial sales are only able to commence in a country once pricing approval has been received 
to secure european regulatory approvals for subcutaneous remodulin for pah  we used the mutual recognition process 
under the rules then applicable  centralized filing was not required and we perceived the decentralized procedure to be the most effective means for approval 
we filed our first maa in france in february review of our application was completed in as a result  remodulin was approved in member countries of the eu under the mutual recognition process described above 
we withdrew applications in spain  the united kingdom and ireland with the intent of resubmitting the applications when we file for approval for intravenous remodulin since these countries required additional information not required by the other european countries 
we had to file for approval for intravenous remodulin using the mutual recognition process since intravenous use of remodulin is considered a variation to the original license 
we filed our application with our reference member state  france  which has notified us that it is not satisfied with our filing 
we are working to address france s concerns and believe that we will eventually receive commercial approval for 
table of contents intravenous remodulin in at least some european countries 
we have regulatory applications pending in other countries as well 
to secure european regulatory approval for inhaled treprostinil  we are using the centralized process 
regulations in europe have changed since we made our initial filing for remodulin and all therapies for orphan diseases must use the centralized process 
we submitted our application for european approval of inhaled treprostinil in december to secure approval of the optineb nebulizer in the united states  applicable regulations require a quality system for the design  manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  installation and servicing of devices intended for commercial distribution 
these quality system regulations require that various specifications and controls be established for devices  devices be designed under a quality system to meet these specifications  devices be manufactured under a quality system  finished devices meet these specifications  devices be correctly installed  checked and serviced  quality data be analyzed to identify and correct quality problems  and complaints be processed 
regulatory authorities may also require additional patient data to support approval for these devices 
we are also subject to inspections by regulatory agencies and ensuring that nebu tec and we meet all requirements during inspections 
to continue marketing our products after approval  applicable regulations require us to maintain a positive risk benefit profile  maintaining regulatory applications through periodic reports to regulatory authorities  fulfilling pharmacovigilance requirements  maintaining manufacturing facilities to good manufacturing practices requirements  and successfully completing regulatory agency inspections  among other requirements 
our telemedicine products are manufactured at contract facilities that are regulated by the fda under different laws and regulations that apply to medical devices 
the telemedicine devices designed and sold by medicomp have received marketing clearance from the fda under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act 
medical devices are required to be manufactured in conformance with the fda s quality system regulations 
in the united states  many independent third party payers  as well as the medicare and medicaid programs  reimburse remodulin 
medicare is the federal program that provides health care benefits to senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons 
medicaid is the federal program administered by the states to provide health care benefits to certain indigent persons 
the medicare contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for remodulin at a rate generally equal to of the published average wholesale price  as recommended by us 
the state medicaid programs also generally provide reimbursement for remodulin at a price that is below the published average wholesale price 
beginning in  the medicare modernization act requires that we and the centers for medicare and medicaid services negotiate a new price for remodulin 
we anticipate that the new rules will not have an impact on remodulin reimbursement rates in in return for including remodulin in the medicare and medicaid programs  we have agreed to pay a rebate to state medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for remodulin 
we have also agreed to sell remodulin under contracts with the veterans administration  department of defense  public health service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as b entities entities designated by federal programs to receive drugs at discounted prices at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors 
these programs and contracts are highly regulated and impose restrictions on our business 
failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for remodulin 
we estimate that between of remodulin sales in the united states are reimbursed under the medicare and medicaid programs

the statements identified as forward looking statements may exist in the section entitled item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses and may not maintain profitability 
although we have maintained annual profitability from to  we have experienced periods in which we recognized net losses 
for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss primarily as a result of expensing one time fees of million related to our license agreement and manufacturing and supply agreement with lilly for tadalafil 
in addition  we have previously incurred quarterly net losses 
while we believe we formulate our annual operating budgets with reasonable assumptions and targets  certain non cash charges and other factors that may be beyond our control could affect our profitability and cause uneven quarterly and annual operating results 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin to produce revenues 
during the year ended december   remodulin sales accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
a wide variety of events  many of which are described in other risk factors below  could cause remodulin sales to decline 
for example  if regulatory approvals for remodulin were withdrawn  we would be unable to sell our product and our revenues would suffer 
in the event that glaxo terminates its assignment agreement or pfizer terminates its license agreement  we would have no further rights to utilize the assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin 
any substantial change in the dosing pattern of patients using remodulin  due to combination therapy  side effects  death or any other reason  could decrease related revenues 
in addition  we rely on third parties to produce  market  distribute and sell remodulin 
the inability of one of these third parties to perform these functions  or the failure of any of these parties to perform 
table of contents successfully  could cause our revenues to suffer 
because we are very dependent on sales of remodulin  any reduction in remodulin sales would cause our results of operations to suffer 
most of our pharmaceutical products are in clinical development and may never generate profits 
our only pharmaceutical product currently in commercial distribution is remodulin for subcutaneous and intravenous administration 
most of our pharmaceutical products are in various stages of clinical development  therefore  many of these products may not become commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
we might not maintain or obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical products and may not be able to sell our pharmaceutical products commercially 
even if we sell our products  we may not be profitable or may not be able to sustain any profitability we achieve 
we may not successfully compete with established and newly developed drugs  products and the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with established drug companies during product development for  among other things  funding  licenses  expertise  personnel  clinical trial patients  and third party collaborators 
we also compete with these companies following the approval of our products 
most of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources than we do 
these competitors also possess more experience in research and development  clinical trials  sales and marketing and regulatory matters than we do 
we are aware of existing treatments that compete with our products  especially in the field of pah 
patients and doctors may perceive these competing products as safer  more effective  more convenient and or less expensive than remodulin 
accordingly  sales of remodulin may not increase  or may decrease if doctors prescribe less remodulin than they prescribe presently 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan 
the first product approved by the fda for the treatment of pah  flolan is a prostacyclin analogue that is delivered by intravenous infusion 
glaxo began marketing flolan in the united states in in  myogen acquired the marketing rights for flolan in the united states 
in november  myogen was acquired by gilead 
the generic exclusivity period for flolan expired in april generic epoprostenol 
in april  teva announced that the fda approved its version of generic epoprostenol for treatment of pah 
this is the first approved generic version of flolan 
in june  generamedix inc generamedix received fda approval for its version of generic epoprostenol 
in february  actelion announced that it had entered into an agreement with generamedix to acquire its generic epoprostenol product  ventavis 
approved in december in the united states and in september in europe  ventavis is the only prostacyclin analogue that has been approved for inhalation 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  in the united states and is marketed by schering ag in europe as iloprost

the first oral drug to be approved for pah  tracleer is also the first drug in its class of eras 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and in may in europe 
tracleer is marketed worldwide by actelion  
table of contents revatio 
approved in june in the united states  revatio is an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer 
revatio contains sildenafil  the same active ingredient as viagra  and is the first pde inhibitor to be approved for pah  letairis 
approved in june in the united states  letairis is an oral therapy marketed by gilead in the united states for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer  letairis is an era 
in april  glaxo received marketing authorization from the emea for letairis in europe where it is known as volibris  and thelin 
approved in august in the eu  thelin is an oral therapy  and was developed and initially marketed by encysive  for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer and letairis  thelin is an era 
in june  pfizer completed its acquisition of encysive 
pfizer has stated that it plans to conduct a pivotal phase iii clinical trial to support registration of thelin in the united states and eventually receive fda approval 
doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin they give to their patients if they prescribe our competitors products in combination with remodulin 
in addition  certain of our competitors products are less invasive than remodulin and the use of these products may delay or prevent initiation of remodulin therapy 
lastly  as a result of merger activity  actelion  gilead and pfizer presently control six of the seven non generic approved therapies for pah in the united states the seventh being remodulin 
actelion  through its acquisition of the commercial rights to generamedix s generic epoprostenol  now controls one of the two approved formulations of generic epoprostenol 
in addition to reducing competition through acquisition  each of these companies exerts considerable influence over prescribers through the sales and marketing of their respective therapies and through market dominance in this therapeutic area 
furthermore  the commercialization of generic forms of other approved pah therapies may exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products 
a number of drug companies are pursuing treatments for the hepatitis c virus and various forms of cancer that will compete with any products we may develop from our glycobiology antiviral agents and monoclonal antibodies platforms 
many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors provide cardiac holter and event monitoring services and systems that compete with our telemedicine products 
discoveries or development of new products or technologies by others may make our products obsolete or less useful 
companies may discover or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
researchers are continually making new discoveries that may lead to new technologies that treat the diseases for which our products are intended 
in addition  alternative approaches to treat chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other investigational therapies for pah could be used in combination with  or as a substitute for remodulin 
if this happens  doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin they give to their patients or may prescribe other treatments instead of remodulin 
this could decrease demand for remodulin and reduce related sales 
remodulin and our other treprostinil based products may have to compete with investigational products currently being developed by other companies  including cialis 
an approved oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  cialis is currently marketed by lilly 
prior to january  when icos corporation was acquired by lilly  cialis was jointly marketed by icos corporation and lilly 
cialis is in the same class of drugs as revatio  pde inhibitors 
tadalafil is the active ingredient in cialis 
the phirst i trial of tadalafil for the treatment of pah was successful 
although we have entered into a license agreement whereby lilly has granted us the exclusive right to commercialize tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in 
table of contents the united states and puerto rico  lilly will retain the rights to commercialize tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension outside the united states and puerto rico  terguride 
in may  ergonex pharma announced that the fda granted orphan drug status to terguride for the treatment of pah

other research is ongoing  aviptadil 
an inhaled formulation of a vasoactive intestinal peptide  aviptadil is being developed by mondobiotech holding sa for the treatment of pah 
in september  mondobiotech holding sa announced that it had outlicensed aviptadil for the treatment of pah to biogen idec inc a small study of aviptadil showed that it tended to improve oxygenation in patients with pah 
further studies are ongoing  prx a serotonin receptor htb antagonist  prx is being developed by epix pharmaceuticals  inc as an oral tablet for the treatment of pah 
in august  epix pharmaceuticals  inc announced the initiation of a right heart catheter study of prx in patients with pah from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension  pulmolar 
currently in development by pr pharmaceuticals  inc  pulmolar is a once a month injectible therapy that contains a metabolite of estradiol and has been shown in animal and cell models to address certain processes associated with pah  fasudil 
oral and inhaled formulations of fasudil  a rho kinase inhibitor  may be developed by actelion for the treatment of pah 
fasudil is currently approved in japan as an intravenous drug to treat a disease unrelated to pah  sorafenib 
originally marketed by bayer healthcare ag bayer as nexavar for advanced renal cell cancer  sorafenib is a small molecule that inhibits raf kinase and may interfere with the thickening of blood vessel walls associated with pah 
on may   the results of a university of chicago study were released demonstrating that pah patients taking nexavar showed improvement in their ability to exercise  recombinant elafin 
currently being developed by proteo biotech ag  recombinant elafin is a synthetic version of a protein that is produced naturally in the body and may inhibit inflammatory reactions 
in march  elafin was granted orphan drug status in the eu for the treatment of pah and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension  ns a novel orally available prostaglandin i receptor agonist  ns is being developed by nippon shinyaku and actelion pursuant to an april license agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  actelion will take over a phase iia clinical study of ns for pah being conducted by nippon shinyaku in europe and will be responsible for global development and commercialization of ns outside japan  cicletanine 
marketed by navitas pharma for hypertension in europe  cicletanine is an enos coupler that works to increase the flexibility of blood vessel linings 
in may  gilead and 
table of contents navitas assets  llc announced that they entered into an agreement whereby gilead acquired all of navitas pharma s assets related to its cicletanine business 
in december  gilead began a phase ii clinical trial to assess the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of cicletanine in pah patients  r bh a naturally occurring enzyme cofactor that is required for numerous biochemical and physiologic processes  including the synthesis of no  r bh is being developed by biomarin pharmaceutical inc for the treatment of various cardiovascular indications and phenylketonuria 
currently  several phase ii clinical trials of r bh for cardiovascular disease are underway 
a phase ii trial of r bh for pad failed to meet its primary endpoint  ono ono is a novel  long acting prostacyclin agonist with thromboxane synthase inhibitory activity being developed by scientists at the national cardiovascular center research institute in osaka  japan 
current published reports have indicated that the compound has shown promising results  riociguat bay 
riociguat is an oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that activates the major cellular receptor for no and mediates a wide range of physiological effects through elevation of intracellular cgmp levels leading to pulmonary vasodilation and increased transpulmonary cgmp release 
riociguat is being developed by bayer for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and pah 
a phase ii clinical trial of riociguat was successfully completed and two phase iii trials are currently underway  aironite 
currently being developed by aires pharmaceuticals  inc under a license agreement with the national institutes of health 
aironite is a novel inhaled nitrite therapy that has been shown in preclinical models to prevent the progression of pulmonary hypertension 
aironite has been granted orphan drug status by the fda 
a phase i study of aironite for pah has been completed  and generic iloprost 
the orphan drug exclusivity on iloprost will expire in we believe that multiple manufacturers are working on a generic formulation that will result in future sales upon expiration of the patent term 
there may be other drugs in development for pah in addition to those listed above 
furthermore  there may be currently approved drugs that prove effective in treating pah 
if any of these drugs are marketed for the treatment of pah  sales of remodulin could decrease 
if third party payers will not reimburse patients for our drug products or if third party payers limit the amount of reimbursement  our sales will suffer 
our commercial success depends heavily on third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  which agree to reimburse patients for the costs of our pharmaceutical products 
these third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new and expensive drugs  and it may be difficult for distributors selling remodulin to obtain reimbursement from these third party payers 
remodulin and the associated infusion pumps and supplies are very expensive 
we believe our investigational products  if approved  will also be very expensive 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin therapy 
in the past  medicare has not reimbursed the full cost of the therapy for some patients 
the medicare modernization act requires that we negotiate a new price for remodulin with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
as a result of the staggered implementation of this act  remodulin has not yet been subject to the pricing provisions 
to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow any reduced medicaid and medicare coverage and payment developments  the negative impact on our business would be compounded 
additionally  some states have enacted health care reform legislation 
further federal and state developments are possible and such potential legislative activity could adversely impact our business 

table of contents third party payers may not approve our new products for reimbursement or may not continue to approve remodulin for reimbursement 
furthermore  third party payers may reduce the amount of reimbursement for remodulin based on changes in pricing of other therapies for pah  including generic formulations of other approved therapies  such as flolan 
if third party payers do not approve a product of ours for reimbursement or limit the amount of reimbursement  sales will decline  as patients could opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
the growth of our cardiac monitoring business is dependent upon physicians utilizing our services 
if we fail to maintain our current level of physician utilization  our cardiac monitoring revenues may stagnate and our business could be adversely affected 
our ability to provide our cardiac monitoring services is dependent upon physicians prescribing our diagnostic tests for their patients 
our success in obtaining patients to monitor will be directly influenced by the relationships we develop and maintain with physicians and physician groups in accordance with government regulations affecting such relationships 
if we are unable to maintain such relationships and create new relationships  the number of patients using our cardiac monitoring services will decline 
this could adversely affect our cardiac monitoring revenues 
if we are unable to educate physicians regarding the benefits of our cardiopal savi and decipher holter monitor systems and fail to achieve sufficient levels of utilization  revenues from our cardiac monitoring services may not grow and could decrease 
reimbursement for cardiac monitoring services by medicare is highly regulated and subject to change 
the operation of our cardiac monitoring facility is subject to rules and regulations governing independent diagnostic testing facilities idtfs 
failure to comply with these rules could prevent us from receiving reimbursement for our cardiac services from medicare and some commercial payers 
we receive approximately percent of our cardiac monitoring service revenues from medicare reimbursements 
reimbursement from medicare for cardiac monitoring services is subject to statutory and regulatory changes  rate adjustments and administrative rulings 
all of these factors could materially affect the range of services covered or the reimbursement rates paid by medicare for use of our cardiac monitoring services 
in  cms instituted a change in the method for calculating reimbursement under the physician fee schedule that will be implemented over a four year period 
consequently  cms has reduced reimbursement for our cardiac monitoring services each year since similar reductions are expected through we cannot predict whether future modifications to medicare s reimbursement policies could reduce the amounts we receive from medicare for the services we provide 
additionally  medicare s reimbursement rates can affect the rate that commercial payers are willing to pay for our products and services 
the medicare program is administered by cms 
cms imposes extensive and detailed requirements on medical service providers 
these requirements include  but are not limited to  rules that govern how we structure our relationships with physicians  how and when we submit reimbursement claims  how we operate our monitoring facilities and how we provide our cardiac monitors and monitoring services 
our failure to comply with applicable medicare rules could result in the discontinuance of our reimbursements  the return of funds paid to us  civil monetary penalties  criminal penalties and or exclusion from the medicare program 
additionally  in order for us to receive reimbursement for cardiac monitoring services from medicare and some commercial payers  we must maintain a call center certified as an idtf 
certification as an idtf requires that we follow strict regulations governing how the center operates  such as requirements regarding certifications of the technicians who review data transmitted from our cardiac monitors 
if regulations change  we may have to alter operating procedures at our monitoring facilities  which could increase our costs significantly 
if we fail to obtain and maintain idtf 
table of contents certification  our services may no longer be reimbursed by medicare and some commercial payers  which could negatively affect our telemedicine business 
we rely in part on third parties to market  distribute and sell most of our products and those third parties may not perform 
we are currently marketing three products in our cardiovascular therapeutic platform remodulin in our prostacyclin analogue platform and cardiopal savi cardiac event monitors and decipher holter monitors in our telemedicine platform 
we also have several products across all of our therapeutic platforms in the clinical trial stage 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies  obtain regulatory approvals  market  distribute and sell all of our products 
therefore  we rely on experienced third parties to perform some of these functions 
we may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we might not be able to market  distribute and sell our products and future revenues could suffer 
we rely on accredo  curascript and caremark to market  distribute  and sell remodulin in the united states 
accredo  curascript and caremark are also responsible for convincing third party payers to reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin  which is very expensive 
if our distributors do not achieve acceptable profit margins  they may not continue to sell our products 
furthermore  if our distributors in the united states and abroad are unsuccessful in their efforts  our revenues will suffer 
since the commercial launch of remodulin  all of our distributors in the united states have merged with larger companies 
when these distributors were smaller and independently managed  the remodulin franchise commanded a more prominent share of their business 
as divisions or subsidiaries of much larger organizations  these distributors may place less emphasis on selling remodulin 
there can be no assurance that the mergers experienced by each of our distributors will not adversely affect remodulin distribution 
in addition  since january  accredo became the exclusive distributor in the united states for flolan 
if our distributors devote fewer resources to sell remodulin  our sales could be negatively affected 
interruptions or delays in telecommunications systems or in network or related services could impair the delivery of our services and harm our telemedicine business 
the success of our telemedicine services and devices is dependent upon our ability to store  retrieve  process and manage data 
furthermore  we must be able to maintain and upgrade our data processing and communication capabilities 
as we expand our commercial activities with respect to our cardiac monitoring business  an increased burden will be placed upon our telecommunications and data processing systems and the equipment upon which they rely 
telecommunication disruptions for any extended length of time  or other systems related problems could have an adverse effect on our telemedicine business 
our operations depend on compliance with complex fda and comparable international regulations 
failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products 
the products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory agencies and  once approved  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable regulatory agencies outside the united states 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacture  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are also subject to extensive regulation 
any new product approvals we receive in the future could include significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
potential products may fail to receive marketing approval on a timely basis  or at all 
if granted  product approvals can be 
table of contents withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements 
product approvals can also be withdrawn upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction 
in addition  our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive continued regulation and review 
although we have never experienced product specification failures with respect to remodulin vials  discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing  regulatory  promotional or commercialization activities could result in regulatory restrictions on our products  including withdrawal of the products from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we could be subject to penalties that may consist of fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products and criminal prosecution 
reports of side effects  such as sepsis  associated with intravenous remodulin could cause physicians and patients to avoid or discontinue use of remodulin in favor of alternative treatments 
sepsis is a serious and potentially life threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria 
intravenous prostacyclins are infused continuously through a catheter placed in a large vein in the patient s chest 
sepsis is an expected consequence of this type of delivery 
as a result  sepsis is included as a risk in both the remodulin and flolan package inserts 
in  the scientific leadership committee slc of the pulmonary hypertension association announced new guidance relating to the treatment of pah patients on long term intravenous therapy 
the slc reminded physicians to be aware of the range of possible gram negative and gram positive infectious organisms in patients with long term central catheters and to treat them appropriately 
we have been informed that the slc is planning a study to evaluate the risk of sepsis and sepsis sub types among parenterally delivered prostanoids 
in february  the fda approved a revised remodulin package insert that more fully described the known infection risk and appropriate techniques to be practiced when preparing and administering remodulin intravenously 
in may  the slc issued a statement that it had created catheter maintenance guidelines for intravenous prostacyclin administration to minimize the risks of developing bloodstream infections 
although a discussion of the risk of sepsis is currently included in the remodulin label  and the occurrence of sepsis is familiar to physicians who prescribe intravenously administered therapies  concerns about bloodstream infections may adversely affect a physician s prescribing practice of remodulin 
if that occurs  sales of remodulin and our profitability could suffer 
we have transitioned our manufacturing operations to a new location and if the fda and other international agencies do not approve our new location for commercial use  our ability to produce treprostinil sodium  the active ingredient in remodulin  could suffer 
in july  we submitted a supplement to the remodulin nda for approval of our phase i laboratory 
we plan to manufacture treprostinil in our phase i laboratory on a larger scale than we did in our facility in chicago  illinois  which we closed in may until we receive fda and international approvals of our phase i laboratory  we cannot sell products containing compounds manufactured there 
we have maintained two years of formulated remodulin based on anticipated demand 
if we experience unexpected delays for approval of our phase i laboratory of more than two years  we may encounter a shortage of treprostinil and this could reduce the availability of our commercial products 
consequently  both our commercial sales and our ability to conduct clinical trials would suffer 

table of contents we depend on third parties to formulate and manufacture our products and related devices 
our ability to generate commercial sales or conduct clinical trials could suffer if our third party vendors fail to perform 
we manufacture treprostinil with raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds supplied by vendors 
the inability of our vendors to supply these raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds in the quantities we require could delay the manufacture of treprostinil for commercial use and for use in clinical trials 
we also rely on third parties to formulate our treprostinil based products 
baxter formulates remodulin from the treprostinil sodium we supply 
recently  baxter verbally informed us that it intends to discontinue the formulation of remodulin by the end of our contractual renewal term in october due to the retirement of the formulation line that is used to produce remodulin 
we are in the process of evaluating alternative supply arrangements  including formulating remodulin in the combination office and laboratory facility that we are currently constructing adjacent to our phase i laboratory 
we expect to have completed construction of this facility by the end of we are also pursuing other third party formulation arrangements 
we plan on increasing our supply of formulated remodulin to three years during and maintaining this supply level thereafter to ensure we have enough to meet expected patient demand 
however  if we experience significant delays in receiving fda approval for an alternative supply arrangement or for our phase i laboratory  we may not have sufficient remodulin in stock to meet commercial demand and our revenues will suffer 
catalent conducts stability studies on remodulin for us  formulates treprostinil in both inhaled and oral forms for our clinical trials and analyzes other products that we are developing 
beginning in  we are planning to formulate oral treprostinil at our new manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
this will be our first attempt at formulating oral treprostinil without the use of a third party 
additionally  we rely on third parties to manufacture all of our products other than treprostinil 
winland electronics  inc manufactures our telemedicine devices  and other manufacturers produce our investigational drugs and devices for use in clinical trials 
we engage nebu tec to manufacture the optineb nebulizer used with inhaled treprostinil 
nebu tec is responsible for managing the manufacturing process of the optineb nebulizer in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
because regulatory approval of inhaled treprostinil will be linked to regulatory approval of the optineb nebulizer  any regulatory compliance problems encountered by nebu tec relative to the manufacture of this device could delay or adversely affect regulatory approvals of inhaled treprostinil 
consequently  this could impede our growth and our revenues could suffer 
in addition  following regulatory approval of inhaled treprostinil  any inability to manufacture nebulizers in sufficient quantities to meet patient demand could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth 
pursuant to a license agreement  effective december   lilly has agreed to grant us the exclusive right to commercialize tadalafil  the active ingredient in cialis  for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the united states and puerto rico 
upon fda approval  lilly will manufacture tadalafil for us and we will use their wholesaler network to distribute the drug pursuant to our manufacturing and supply agreement with them 
we have agreed to purchase tadalafil from lilly at a fixed cost  which may be adjusted by lilly from time to time 
the cialis patent expires in late as a result  there is a limited time period before generic tadalafil will be available 
any delays in fda approval would further shorten the time period during which we are able to market tadalafil before a generic competitor becomes available and our revenues could suffer 
although there are a few companies that could replace our current suppliers  we believe other suppliers could provide similar services and materials 
a change in suppliers  could cause a delay in the 
table of contents distribution of remodulin and our other products and services  and impede the progress of our clinical trials and commercial launch plans 
this would adversely affect our research and development and future sales efforts 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacturing processes for some of our investigational products have not been tested in quantities necessary for commercial sales  we are planning to produce all forms of treprostinil ourselves and have never done so previously  delays in scale up to commercial quantities and process validation could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our investigational products  a long lead time is needed to manufacture treprostinil and remodulin  and the manufacturing process is complex  both we and the manufacturers and formulators of our products are subject to the fda s current good manufacturing practices in the united states and similar or more stringent regulatory standards internationally 
although we can control compliance issues with respect to our internal synthesis and manufacturing processes  we do not have control over regulatory compliance by our third party manufacturers  even if we and the manufacturers and formulators of our products were to comply with domestic and international drug manufacturing regulations  the sterility and quality of the products being manufactured and formulated could be deficient 
if this were to occur  such products would not be available for sale or use  if we have to replace a manufacturing or formulation contractor for any reason or abandon our own manufacturing operations  the fda and international drug regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections 
furthermore  a new manufacturer or formulator  including any replacement for baxter who intends to discontinue formulating remodulin in october  would have to be educated in the processes necessary to manufacture and commercially validate our product  we may be unable to manufacture or formulate products internally other than remodulin as planned  or at all  we may be unable to obtain manufacturers and formulators for those products that we do not plan to manufacture or formulate internally  we may be unable to obtain manufacturers and formulators to serve as additional sources for products that we manufacture or formulate internally  the supply of materials and components necessary to manufacture and package remodulin and our other products may become scarce or interrupted 
disruptions to the supply of these materials could delay the manufacture and subsequent sale of such products 
any products manufactured with substituted materials or components would be subject to approvals from the fda and international regulatory agencies before they could be sold 
the timing of such fda and international regulatory approval is difficult to predict and may be delayed  we may not have sufficient intellectual property rights  or we may have to share intellectual property rights to many of the improvements in the manufacturing processes or to new manufacturing processes for our products  and suppliers may increase the prices at which they are willing to sell materials  components or finished products  and we may be unable to adjust our prices accordingly 
any of these factors could delay clinical studies or commercialization of our products  entail higher costs  and result in our inability to effectively sell our products 

table of contents if our products fail in clinical studies  we will be unable to obtain or maintain fda and international approvals and will be unable to sell those products 
in order to sell our pharmaceutical products  we must receive regulatory approvals 
to obtain those approvals  we must conduct clinical studies demonstrating that our drug products  including their delivery mechanisms  are safe and effective 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical studies beyond those for which we have planned 
if we cannot obtain approval from the fda and international regulatory agencies for a product  that product cannot be sold and our future revenue growth may decline 
in the past  several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process 
some of these products include ovarex mab for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer  immediate release beraprost for early stage peripheral vascular disease  ketotop for osteoarthritis of the knee and ut for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
in november  we reported that our freedom c trial of oral treprostinil did not meet statistical significance for its primary endpoint 
as a result  we are in the process of redesigning our current freedom m trial and planning for a new freedom c trial and thus expect delays in completing our clinical trials for oral treprostinil 
currently  we do not anticipate filing an nda for oral treprostinil before the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing varies by product and by product use 
furthermore  we cannot predict with certainty the length of time it will take to complete necessary clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval of our future products 
our ongoing and planned clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons 
these reasons include the drug is ineffective  or physicians believe that the drug is ineffective  patients do not enroll in our studies at the rate we expect  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  our clinical study sites do not adhere to the study protocol  our studies do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines  patients die during the study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems unrelated to the drug being studied  other ongoing or new clinical trials conducted by other drug companies or ourselves may reduce the number of patients available for our studies  drug supplies are unavailable or unsuitable for use in our studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in our studies 
in addition  the fda and international regulatory authorities have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products 
the fda and international regulatory authorities may not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy 

table of contents our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we comply with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
the development  manufacture  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations 
while we have developed and instituted corporate compliance programs  we cannot ensure that our employees or we are or will always be in compliance with these regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to a range of penalties including but not limited to the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government healthcare programs  and other sanctions or litigation 
if the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements we depend on are breached or terminated  we would lose our right to develop and sell the products covered by such agreements 
our business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others 
related drugs and other products include remodulin  tadalafil and all other products in our prostacyclin  glycobiology antiviral agents  and monoclonal antibodies platforms 
under our product license agreements  we receive certain rights to existing intellectual property owned by third parties subject to the terms of each license agreement 
our assignment agreements transfer all right  title and interest in and to the intellectual property to us  subject to the terms of each agreement 
we also obtain licenses to other third party technologies to conduct our business 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to other third party technologies to commercialize our early stage products 
this dependence contains the following risks we may be unable to obtain future licenses or assignment agreements at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our licenses or assignment agreements are terminated  we will lose our rights to develop and market the products covered by such licenses or assignment agreements  our licenses and assignment agreements generally provide the licensor or assignor the right to terminate in the event we breach such agreements eg  we fail to timely pay royalties and other fees  if a licensor or assignor fails to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to us as required by most of our licenses and assignment agreements  we may lose our rights to develop and market some or all of our products 
in addition  we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or force the licensor or assignor to do so  and  if lilly is unable to obtain or maintain fda approval for tadalafil  we will be unable to develop and commercialize tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension 
certain license and assignment agreements relating to our products may restrict our ability to develop products in certain countries and or for particular diseases and may impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
when we acquire  license  or receive assignments of drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others  our rights may be limited 
for instance  our rights to market tadalafil are limited to the united states and puerto rico  unless lilly decides not to market the drug in another country  at which time we would have the opportunity to negotiate for rights to market the drug in that country 
provisions in our license and assignment agreements may impose other restrictions that affect the development and marketing of our products 
for example  in assigning remodulin to us  glaxo retained 
table of contents an exclusive option and right of first refusal to negotiate a license agreement with us if we decide to license any aspect of the commercialization of remodulin anywhere in the world 
similarly  our amended license agreement with toray to develop and market beraprost mr includes a conditional non compete clause benefiting toray in that it grants toray the right to be our exclusive provider of beraprost mr drug substance 
we must also meet certain minimum annual sales to maintain our exclusive rights to beraprost mr 
in addition  lilly has retained authority over all regulatory activities with respect to tadalafil  and will have the right to determine the retail price for tadalafil which will be at price parity with cialis and the price at which we purchase tadalafil from lilly 
lilly also has the right to approve any additional investigatory work we do with tadalafil in other indications of pulmonary hypertension 
these restrictions could affect our freedom to develop and market our products in the future 
if our or our suppliers patents or other intellectual property protections are inadequate  our sales and profits could suffer or our competitors could force our products out of the market 
our us patent for the method of treating pah with remodulin will expire in october the patents for inhaled treprostinil will expire in  and lilly s patents for tadalafil will expire in we believe that certain patents to which we have rights may be eligible for extensions of up to five years pursuant to patent term restoration procedures in europe and the hatch waxman act in the united states 
our patent for treating pah with remodulin has already received the maximum five year extension 
competitors may develop products based on the same active ingredients as our products and market those products after our patents expire  or design around or seek to invalidate our existing patents before they expire 
if this happens  our sales would suffer and our profits could decline significantly 
in addition  if our suppliers intellectual property protection is inadequate  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
we have been granted patents in the united states for the synthesis of remodulin  but patent applications that have been or may be filed by us may not result in the issuance of additional patents 
the scope of any patent may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of international jurisdictions where we intend to sell our products may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others  but these agreements may be ineffective in protecting our proprietary information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or obtain access to our know how 
litigation  which can be costly  may be necessary to enforce or defend our patents or proprietary rights and may not conclude in our favor 
while we have settled previous litigation to enforce our arginine patents  we may initiate future litigation against other parties we believe have violated our patents or other proprietary rights 
if such litigation is unsuccessful or if the patents are invalidated or canceled  we may have to write off related intangible assets which could significantly reduce our earnings 
any licensed rights  patents or other intellectual property we possess may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and therefore  may not provide any competitive advantage to us 
in july  vanderbilt university filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware against icos corporation icos seeking to add three of its scientists as co inventors on the tadalafil compound and method of use patents 
lilly has since acquired icos 
the patents that are the subject of this lawsuit are the same patents licensed to us by lilly under our december license agreement 
in january  the district court judge ruled in favor of icos lilly  declining to add any of these scientists as an inventor on either patent 
the plaintiff may appeal this ruling 
lilly believes these claims are without legal merit and expects to prevail in any 
table of contents appeal of this litigation  however  it is not possible to determine the outcome 
an unfavorable final outcome could have a material adverse impact on our license for tadalafil for pulmonary hypertension 
patents may be issued to others and this could impede the manufacture or sale of our products 
we may have to license those patents and pay significant fees or royalties to the owners of those patents in order to keep marketing our products 
these added fees could reduce our profits 
to the extent valid third party patents cover our products or services  we or our strategic collaborators would be required to seek licenses from the holders of these patents in order to manufacture  use  or sell our products and services 
payments under these licenses would reduce our profits from the sale of related products and services 
we may be unable to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of our technology to avoid infringing a third party patent  we may be unable to market some of our products and services  which would limit our sales and future growth 
proposed changes to united states patent law are currently pending in congress 
if these proposed patent reforms become law  it could make it easier for patents to be invalidated and or could reduce the amount of damages awarded in cases of patent infringement 
because we rely on patents to protect our products  proposed patent reform could negatively impact our business 
pursuant to our agreements with certain business partners  any new inventions or intellectual properties arising from our activities will be jointly owned by us and these partners 
if we do not have rights to new developments or inventions that arise during the terms of these agreements  or we have to share the rights with others  we may lose some or all of the benefit of these new developments or inventions  which may mean a loss of future profits or cost savings 
our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing third party patents or other proprietary rights 
if we infringe third party patents  we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from those third parties 
we may be unable to obtain alternative technologies or acquire a license on reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain such licenses or alternative technologies  we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products 
if our highly qualified management and technical personnel leave us  our business may suffer 
our success is highly dependent on key members of our management team  including our founder and chief executive officer  martine rothblatt  phd  our president and chief operating officer  roger jeffs  phd  our chief financial officer and treasurer  john ferrari  our executive vice president for strategic planning and general counsel  paul mahon  our chief manufacturing officer and executive vice president for pharmaceutical development  david zaccardelli  pharmd  and our executive vice president for regulatory affairs and compliance  dean bunce 
while these individuals are employed by us pursuant to multi year employment agreements  such agreements do not ensure their continued retention 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on these officers 
however  we do incentivize our key personnel to remain employed by us until at least age through our supplemental executive retirement plan 
the success of our business will depend in part on retaining the services of our existing key management personnel and attracting and retaining new highly qualified personnel 
few individuals possess expertise in the field of cardiovascular medicine  infectious disease and oncology 
as such  competition for qualified management and personnel is considerable 

table of contents we may not maintain adequate insurance and this could expose us to significant product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of human drugs and diagnostics involve product liability risks 
although we currently are covered by product liability insurance for claims of up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate  we may not be able to maintain this insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  our insurance coverage may not be adequate for all potential claims 
if claims or losses significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may be forced out of business 
our marketable investments maybe subject to loss 
there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets 
even though we believe we take a conservative approach to investing our funds  these periods of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets expose us to investment risk  including the risk that the value and liquidity of our investments could deteriorate significantly and the issuers of the securities we hold could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
this could result in future impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio and our cash flows and operating results could be negatively affected 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  product development and sales efforts may be limited 
we may need to spend more money than anticipated 
unplanned expenditures could be significant and may result from necessary modifications to product development plans or product offerings in response to difficulties encountered with clinical studies 
we may also face unexpected costs in preparing products for commercial sales  or in maintaining sales of remodulin 
we may be unable to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if additional funds are unavailable  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
settlement of our convertible senior notes due october convertible senior notes  will involve significant outlays of our cash 
specifically  the convertible senior notes will require us to repay in cash  upon maturity or conversion  the million principal balance or the conversion price  whichever is less 
under the current market conditions  some of the holders of our convertible senior notes may seek liquidity  which could cause them to convert their notes prior to the maturity date 
if we do not have sufficient financial resources or are unable to obtain suitable financing to pay amounts due upon the maturity or conversion of the convertible senior notes  we would be in default 
we adopted our share tracking awards plan stap in june awards granted under our stap entitle participants to receive in cash an amount equal to the appreciation in our common stock  which is calculated as the positive difference between the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the date of exercise 
consequently  we may be required to make significant cash payments under our stap 
if we do not have sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our stap  or are unable to secure alternative sources of financing on terms acceptable to us  we may lose key employees and could face litigation 
improper handling of hazardous materials used in our activities could expose us to significant liabilities 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemical and hazardous substances 
furthermore  we are expanding these activities to new locations 
such activities subject us to numerous federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern the management  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we 
table of contents may be required to incur significant costs in order to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations 
we may also be subject to substantial fines and penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations 
while we believe we comply with laws and regulations governing these materials  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
furthermore  once chemical and hazardous materials leave our site  we cannot control what our hazardous waste removal contractors choose to do with these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of the release of hazardous materials 
any related liability could exceed our resources and could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may encounter substantial difficulties managing our growth 
several risks are inherent in our business development plans 
achieving our goals will require substantial investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and facilities 
for example  we have spent considerable resources building and seeking regulatory approvals for our laboratories and manufacturing facilities 
these facilities may be insufficient to meet future demand for our products 
conversely  we may have excess capacity at these facilities if future demand falls short of our expectations 
in addition  constructing our facilities is expensive  and our ability to recover our investment will depend on sales of the products manufactured at these facilities in sufficient volume to substantially increase our revenues 
if we experience sales growth  we may have difficulty managing inventory levels 
marketing new therapies is complicated  and gauging future demand is difficult and uncertain 
we invest in auction rate securities that are subject to market risk and the recent problems in the financial markets could adversely affect the value and liquidity of our investments in these securities 
as of december   our non current marketable securities included approximately million par value in auction rate securities that are currently illiquid 
in november  we elected to participate in the court ordered repurchase program by the investment firm from which we purchased our auction rate securities 
from the period beginning on june  and ending july   we can require the investment firm to repurchase any of our auction rate securities at par value 
our ability to fully recover the carrying amount of these investments is limited in the near term and may never be fully recoverable if the investment firm fails to perform its obligations under the repurchase program or we cannot sell these securities ourselves under satisfactory terms 
our ability to recognize the full value of our business tax credits may be limited 
as of december   we had approximately million of business tax credit carryforwards 
these tax credit carryforwards expire on various dates through the internal revenue service irs has not yet audited or reviewed these business tax credits since we have not yet utilized them 
we have conducted reviews of these business tax credits with the help of outside tax experts  including our independent auditors  ernst young  llp 
although we have recognized reserves for those business tax credits that we believe may be disallowed upon examination by the irs  it is possible that the irs may reduce our business tax credits further 
any reduction of business tax credits will increase our tax expense and shorten the time period before we are required to pay federal income taxes 
in addition  certain business tax credit carryforwards that were generated at various dates prior to december may be subject to limitations on their use pursuant to internal revenue code section section as a result of ownership changes as defined by section however  we do not expect that these business tax credits will expire unused 
if we are deemed to undergo any further ownership changes in the future  then certain business tax credit carryforwards might be deferred or expire unused 

table of contents furthermore  our future operations might not generate sufficient profits to be offset by these business tax credit carryforwards 
in such an event  all or a portion of our business tax credit carryforwards might expire unused 
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock could be volatile and could decline 
the market prices for the securities of drug and biotechnology companies are highly volatile  and there are significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may be unrelated to particular companies operating performances 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated high low january  december  january  december  january  december  the price of our common stock could decline suddenly due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts or our projections  the pace of enrollment in and results of our clinical trials  physician  patient  investor or public concerns as to the efficacy and or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others  changes in  or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of remodulin by medicare or medicaid and changes in reimbursement policies of private health insurance companies  announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  disagreements with our licensors and critical vendors  future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders  future sales of our common stock by our directors and officers  future issuances of common stock by us or any other activity which could be viewed as being dilutive to our shareholders  rumors among investors and or analysts concerning our company  our products  or operations  failure to maintain  or changes to  our approvals to sell remodulin  failure to obtain approval of ndas  from the fda and international regulatory agencies  failure to successfully obtain approval for our new phase i laboratory from the fda and international regulatory agencies  the accumulation of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other investors or the significant accumulation of our common stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short term holdings  timing and outcome of additional regulatory submissions and approvals  and 
table of contents general market conditions 
we may fail to meet third party projections for our revenue or profits 
many independent securities analysts publish quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits 
these projections are developed independently by the securities analysts based on their own analyses 
such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty  particularly because we do not generally provide forward looking guidance to the public 
as a result  actual revenues and net income may differ from what was projected by securities analysts 
even small variations in reported revenues and profits compared to securities analysts expectations can lead to significant changes in our stock price 
sales of shares of our common stock may depress our stock price 
the price of our common stock could decline upon the occurrence of any of the following events if we issue common stock to raise capital or to acquire a license or business  if our stockholders transfer ownership of our common stock  or sell substantial amounts in the public market  or  if investors become concerned that substantial sales may occur 
all of our executive officers and some of our directors have announced their adoption of prearranged trading plans under rule b of the exchange act 
in accordance with these plans  our executive officers and directors periodically sell a specified number of shares of our common stock either owned by them or acquired through the exercise of stock options 
however  our executive officers and directors may choose to sell additional shares outside of these trading plans and several have done so 
a decrease in the price of our common stock could make it difficult for us to raise capital or fund acquisitions through the use of our stock 
the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes when the price of our common stock reaches or exceeds per share would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
the convertible senior notes are convertible initially into million shares of our common stock 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised or additional shares of capital stock are issued  existing stockholder ownership may be further diluted 
the fundamental change purchase feature of the convertible senior notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 
the terms of the convertible senior notes require us to purchase them for cash in the event of a fundamental change of ownership 
a takeover of our company would trigger the requirement that we purchase the convertible senior notes 
this may delay or prevent a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws  shareholder rights plan  and employment and license agreements could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that may be beneficial to our public stockholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and the replacement or removal of current management by our stockholders 

table of contents for example  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes 
members of each class are elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for stockholders to change the majority of directors 
it may also deter the accumulation of large blocks of our common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
non compete and other restrictive covenants in most of our employment agreements will terminate upon a change in control that is not approved by our board of directors 
we enter into certain license agreements that generally prohibit our counterparties to these agreements or their affiliates from taking necessary steps to acquire or merge with us  either directly or indirectly throughout the term of these agreements  plus a specified period thereafter 
we are also party to certain license agreements that restrict our ability to assign or transfer the rights licensed to us thereunder to third parties  including parties with whom we wish to merge  or those attempting to acquire us 
these agreements often require that we obtain the prior consent of the counterparties to these agreements if we are contemplating a change in control 
if our counterparties to these agreements withhold their prior consent  related agreements could be terminated and we would lose all rights thereunder 
these restrictive change in control provisions could impede or prevent mergers that could benefit our stockholders 
our existing directors and executive officers own a substantial portion of our common stock and might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  shares beneficially owned include stock options that could be exercised by those directors and executive officers within days of december  accordingly  these stockholders as a group may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our directors 
such stockholder influence could delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain our earnings for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
as a result  the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares

overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of unique products to address the unmet medical needs of patients with chronic and life threatening cardiovascular and infectious diseases and cancer 
since our inception in june  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development programs and acquisitions 
our key therapeutic platforms include prostacyclin analogues stable synthetic forms of prostacyclin  an important molecule produced by the body that has powerful effects on blood vessel health and function  phosphodiesterase pde inhibitors molecules that act to inhibit the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp in cells 
cgmp is activated by nitric oxide no  a naturally occurring substance in the body that signals the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle  monoclonal antibodies antibodies that activate patients immune systems to treat cancer  and glycobiology antiviral agents a novel class of small  sugar like molecules that have shown pre clinical indications of efficacy against a broad range of viruses  such as hepatitis c 
we focus most of our resources on these key therapeutic platforms 
in addition  we devote resources to the commercialization and development of telemedicine products and services  principally for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias abnormal heart rhythms 
we began generating pharmaceutical revenues in upon receiving approval from the united states food and drug administration fda for our lead product  remodulin treprostinil sodium injection remodulin to be administered via subcutaneous under the skin infusion for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 
since  the fda has expanded its approval of remodulin for intravenous in the vein use and for the treatment of patients who require transition from flolan 
in addition to the united states  remodulin is approved in many other countries worldwide  primarily for subcutaneous use 
in june  we filed a new drug application nda with the fda for our inhaled formulation of treprostinil 
in december  we filed a marketing authorization application maa for inhaled treprostinil with the european medicines agency emea using the centralized filing process 
revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of remodulin 

table of contents our sales and marketing team included approximately employees as of december   up from approximately employees as of december  we anticipate continued growth in our sales force in the near term as we continue to position our business for expansion 
we divide our sales force into two teams 
one sales team is primarily responsible for medical practice accounts that are historical remodulin prescribers 
the other sales team focuses on medical practices that have not historically prescribed remodulin 
in addition  our specialty pharmaceutical distributors supplement the efforts of our sales force 
the market in which we operate is highly competitive 
we face stiff competition from other companies that market and sell competing therapies  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
our domestic distributors  accredo therapeutics  inc accredo  curascript  inc curascript  and cvs caremark corporation caremark  sell remodulin to patients in the united states 
we also engage various international distributors to sell remodulin abroad 
because discontinuation of remodulin therapy can be life threatening  we require that our distributors maintain minimum contingent inventory levels 
due to this requirement  sales of remodulin to our distributors in any given quarter may not be entirely indicative of patient demand 
our distributors typically place one bulk order per month in the first half of the month 
the size of bulk distributor orders is based on estimates of future demand and considerations of contractual minimum inventory requirements 
as such  our sales of remodulin are affected by the timing and magnitude of these bulk orders by our distributors 
subsequent to receiving fda approval of remodulin in  we have funded our operations mainly from sales of remodulin in the united states and abroad 
in addition to revenues derived from sales of remodulin  we have generated revenues from telemedicine products and services sold in the united states 
our telemedicine products and services are designed to detect cardiac arrhythmias  and ischemic heart disease  a condition that causes poor blood flow to the heart 
expenses since our inception  we have devoted substantial resources toward our research and development activities 
accordingly  we incur considerable costs relating to our clinical trials and research  conducted both internally and by third parties  on a variety of projects to develop pharmaceutical therapies 
we also seek to acquire promising technologies and or compounds from third parties to be incorporated in our developmental projects and products through licensing arrangements or acquisitions 
principal components of our operating expenses consist of research and development  selling  general and administrative  and cost of both product and service sales 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects focus on the use of treprostinil and tadalafil to treat cardiovascular diseases  monoclonal antibodies to treat a variety of cancers and glycobiology antiviral agents to treat infectious diseases 
cardiovascular disease projects inhaled treprostinil 
we are developing an inhaled formulation of treprostinil sodium for the treatment of pah 
in june  we commenced a week randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase iii trial of inhaled treprostinil in patients with pah who were also being treated with tracleer  an oral endothelin receptor antagonist era  or revatio  a pde inhibitor 
this trial  triumph treprostinil inhalation used in the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension  was conducted at approximately centers in the united states and europe 
in november  we announced the completion of our triumph trial 
analysis of the triumph results demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in median six minute walk distance mwd of 
table of contents approximately meters in patients receiving inhaled treprostinil compared to patients receiving placebo 
consequently  we submitted an nda on june   to obtain fda approval to market inhaled treprostinil in the united states 
the optineb nebulizer the ultra sonic nebulizer that was used exclusively for administration of inhaled treprostinil in the triumph trial was submitted for approval as part of this filing 
optineb is manufactured exclusively by nebu tec international med products eike kern gmbh nebu tec 
the optineb is ce marked in europe  which means that nebu tec has asserted that the device conforms to european union health and safety requirements 
on december   we executed an agreement of sale and transfer and related agreements agreement with nebu tec to acquire the optineb business and all of the assets  properties and rights used in the optineb business acquired assets 
we entered into the agreement to reduce the risks associated with our dependency on nebu tec and to obtain control over the production of the optineb nebulizer 
pursuant to the agreement  the aggregate purchase price consists of million  and up to million in contingent consideration see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the acquired assets under the agreement will not transfer to us until the closing  which is to occur following the fda s approval of our nda for inhaled treprostinil 
standard fda review of an nda generally takes to months from the date of submission 
the optineb nebulizer was also included as part of our december maa submission 
we were recently notified that the fda office of safety and epidemiology has preliminarily approved the tradename tyvaso for our inhaled treprostinil therapy 
the fda division of cardiorenal drug products will conduct the final review and approval of the tradename  which usually occurs simultaneously with nda approval 
we are conducting a phase iv open label study in the united states to investigate what occurs when patients on ventavis  the only currently approved inhaled prostacyclin  are switched to inhaled treprostinil 
enrollment for this study is expected to range from to patients 
we commenced enrollment for this study in december oral treprostinil 
we are developing an oral formulation of treprostinil treprostinil diethanolamine 
in october we initiated two multi national  placebo controlled clinical trials of oral treprostinil in patients with pah at approximately centers to study both dosing and efficacy 
the freedom c trial was a week study of patients currently on approved background therapy using a pde inhibitor  such as revatio or an era  such as tracleer  or a combination of both 
we completed enrollment for the freedom c trial at patients in may and subsequently announced the results of the freedom c trial in november analysis of the results demonstrated that the trial did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint the change in mwd at week compared to baseline 
initial investigation of the results suggested that the inability to dose titrate increase the dose to tolerability oral treprostinil above what appeared to be suboptimal dosing levels in this study was a limiting factor that suppressed the overall treatment effect 
we believe that the results of the freedom c trial  particularly as they relate to treatment effect and dosing achieved  warrant the continued development of oral treprostinil 
we are planning a second freedom c trial  freedom c  to continue studying dosage and efficacy of oral treprostinil in pah patients on approved background therapy 
we estimate enrolling patients in the freedom c clinical trial beginning in late the freedom m trial is a week study of newly diagnosed patients not currently on any background therapy 
enrollment in freedom m was closed on october  with patients enrolled in the trial 
based on what we learned from the freedom c trial relating to patient tolerability of our three different tablet strengths of oral treprostinil  we submitted a protocol amendment to the fda on february  seeking to increase the number of patients enrolled in 
table of contents freedom m by approximately these new patients will start the study on the mg tablet  which we learned from the freedom c trial is the best tolerated tablet strength 
in addition  our amendment to the freedom m protocol seeks to limit the primary statistical analysis of the trial to those patients who started the trial using the mg tablet 
we believe that this protocol amendment will allow us to more accurately assess the effectiveness of oral treprostinil 
we hope that by starting the additional patients on the mg tablets and titrating the doses  patients will be able to reach an effective maintenance dose with the lower dosage tablet 
the study should have a reduced rate of premature discontinuation due to adverse events 
if we are successful in enrolling patients for this extended portion of the study  we will then be able to statistically power our analysis using a reduced effect size from a to meter change in mwd  a change in the study s statistical significance from to and a change the mwd study endpoint to include only patients who had access to the mg tablets at randomization when study drug is first administered at the beginning of the trial 
if these amendments to the study are successful  we believe that the results will reflect the expected dosing regimen for oral treprostinil 
due to the time required to receive fda consent for the protocol amendment and to package and ship new clinical trial supplies to study sites  we expect to begin enrolling additional patients in the second quarter of tadalafil 
in november  we entered into the following agreements with eli lilly and company and one of its subsidiaries collectively  lilly a license agreement  a manufacturing and supply agreement and a stock purchase agreement 
we completed the initial transactions contemplated by these agreements in december pursuant to the license agreement  we paid an upfront fee to lilly of million for the exclusive right to develop  market  promote and commercialize the orally administered tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the united states and puerto rico 
tadalafil is the active ingredient in cialis  also developed and marketed by lilly for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
additionally  we agreed to pay lilly royalties equal to of net sales of tadalafil for pulmonary hypertension as a pass through of lilly s third party royalty obligations 
we will purchase tadalafil from lilly pursuant to the manufacturing and supply agreement 
the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement provide that lilly will manufacture and distribute tadalafil through its wholesaler network as lilly would for its other pharmaceutical products and included an upfront fee of million 
the total upfront fees paid to lilly in december of million under the license and manufacturing and supply agreements were charged to research and development expenses during the quarter ended december   because tadalafil had not yet received marketing approval from the fda and therefore  commercial feasibility had not yet been established 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock from treasury to lilly in exchange for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
beraprost mr 
we are developing a modified release formulation of beraprost beraprost mr for pah 
beraprost mr is an oral prostacyclin analogue 
in march  our subsidiary lung rx  inc lung rx entered into an amended version of the june license agreement between toray industries  inc toray and us to expand our rights related to the commercialization of beraprost mr 
we are currently enrolling a phase ii clinical study of beraprost mr to explore multiple dose tolerability in patients with pah and planning a phase iii clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of beraprost mr for the treatment of pah 
in october  toray announced that beraprost mr received regulatory approval in japan for the treatment of pah 
in july  beraprost mr was granted orphan medicinal product designation by the emea 
we incurred expenses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  on our cardiovascular programs 
we have spent approximately million from inception to december   on our cardiovascular programs 

table of contents cancer disease projects in december  we announced the completion of our impact i and ii pivotal trials of ovarex mab ovarex  which we had exclusively licensed from altarex medical corp 
altarex 
results of the trials failed to reach statistical significance 
based on the results of these trials  we terminated our license agreement with altarex and discontinued further development of our ovarian cancer program of monoclonal antibodies 
we do not expect to incur additional significant costs related to this program 
in december  we entered into two agreements with memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc to exclusively license certain rights to two investigational monoclonal antibodies f and h for the treatment of neuroblastoma and metastatic brain cancer 
the monoclonal antibody f is a mouse igg mab  which is currently used in an investigational setting for the treatment of neuroblastoma 
neuroblastoma is a rare cancer of the sympathetic nervous system mainly affecting children 
the fda granted orphan drug status to f on october  h is also a mouse monoclonal antibody  but of the igg subclass 
the h antibody is highly reactive with a range of human solid tumors  including brain cancers 
the h antibody is in early investigational development for metastatic brain cancer 
we are currently working on clinical development plans for both antibodies and expect to begin clinical development of the f antibody in we incurred expenses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  on our cancer programs 
we have spent approximately million from inception to december   on our cancer programs 
infectious disease projects pursuant to our research agreement with oxford university  we have the exclusive right to commercialize miglustat as an anti viral agent for the treatment of all sugar coated viruses  including hepatitis c 
our infectious disease program also includes glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in various preclinical and clinical stages of testing for the treatment of a wide variety of viruses 
through our agreement with oxford university  we are also supporting research into new glycobiology antiviral drug candidates and technologies 
in january  we entered into a license agreement with migenix  inc migenix  a canadian company  to obtain the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize celgosivir 
celgosivir is a novel antiviral agent that appears to be a potent inhibitor of alpha glucosidase i  a host enzyme critical to the folding of the viral proteins 
inhibition of alpha glucosidase i leads to improper viral folding  which  in turn  prevents viral replication 
this effect has many applications 
the rights to develop and commercialize celgosivir are contingent upon our acceptance of further preclinical studies to be performed by migenix to assess celgosivir s ability in combating the hepatitis c virus 
we incurred expenses of approximately million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  on our infectious disease projects 
we have spent approximately million from inception to december   on our infectious disease programs 
project risks there are inherent uncertainties involved in the drug development process as well as the associated regulatory review and approval processes 
consequently  we cannot reliably estimate completion dates  expected costs or the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with our various drugs currently under development 
risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of the products discussed above include the following products may fail in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not be willing to participate in clinical studies  
table of contents hospitals  physicians and patients may not properly adhere to clinical study protocols  the drugs may not be safe and effective or may be perceived as unsafe and ineffective  other approved or investigational therapies may be viewed as safer  more effective or more convenient  patients may experience severe side effects during treatment  patients may die during a clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  other ongoing or new clinical trials conducted by other drug companies or ourselves may reduce the number of patients available for our studies  patients may not enroll in our studies at the rate we expect  the fda  international regulatory authorities or local internal review boards may delay or withhold approvals to commence clinical trials or to manufacture our drugs  the fda or international regulatory authorities may request that additional studies be performed  we may incur higher than anticipated costs with respect to third party manufacturers or service providers we engage to perform research or to conduct clinical trials on our behalf  drug supplies may be insufficient to treat patients in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing may cause delays in the commencement of clinical trials 
if our projects are not completed in a timely manner  regulatory approvals could be delayed and our operations  liquidity and financial position could suffer 
without regulatory approvals  we cannot commercialize and sell these products 
therefore  potential revenues and profits from these products could be delayed or may never be realized 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for corporate and marketing personnel  travel  office expenses  insurance  rent and utilities  professional fees  advertising and marketing and depreciation and amortization 
cost of product sales cost of product sales comprises costs to manufacture or acquire products sold to customers 
we manufacture treprostinil using advanced intermediate compounds purchased in bulk from third party vendors 
we utilize multiple vendors that are capable of manufacturing greater quantities of these compounds less expensively than we are 
we expect to begin commercial production of treprostinil in our new facility in silver spring  maryland  upon receiving fda approval for the facility  which is anticipated to occur during the first half of upon commercialization of oral treprostinil  we believe the demand for treprostinil diethanolamine  the form of treprostinil used in our oral tablet  will exceed that for treprostinil sodium  the form of treprostinil used in remodulin and inhaled treprostinil 
accordingly  our planned manufacturing process has been designed to give us the flexibility to produce both forms of treprostinil efficiently in proportion to forecasted demand 
cost of service sales cost of service sales includes salaries and related expenses  share based compensation expense  and related overhead necessary to provide telemedicine services to customers 

table of contents future prospects our future initiatives include expanding use of our prostacyclin therapy from the last line of treatment for patients with advanced stages of pah to front line therapy for newly diagnosed patients 
we also hope to expand the use of treprostinil based drugs and other therapies in development to treat diseases other than pah 
in june  we submitted an nda to the fda for marketing approval of inhaled treprostinil 
if we are successful in obtaining fda approval within our anticipated time frame  then we expect to begin selling inhaled treprostinil in in connection with these activities  we intend to enter into new distribution agreements for our inhaled formulation of treprostinil 
in december  we obtained license rights from lilly to develop  market  promote and commercialize the orally administered drug  tadalafil  for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the united states and puerto rico 
currently  lilly is seeking fda approval for tadalafil 
if the fda review process proceeds as anticipated  we could begin to recognize related revenues during our trial for our inhaled formulation of treprostinil was successful and we believe that our freedom m and freedom c trials for our oral formulation of treprostinil will also be successful 
we expect that the products developed under these trials will generate future sources of revenue 
however  prior to fda approval of inhaled and or oral treprostinil for marketing  we could be required to perform additional studies 
if this were to occur  related delays in the possible commercialization of these products could impede our continued rate of revenue growth 
however  because pah is a progressive disease with no cure  many patients continue to deteriorate on the currently approved oral and inhaled therapies 
this presents market growth opportunities for remodulin as a viable alternative or complementary treatment to these therapies 
furthermore  we believe that the market for remodulin will continue to expand as more patients are diagnosed with pah each year 
our future growth and profitability will depend on many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the timing of commercialization of products in the later stages of development  the selling prices of  and demand for  our products and services  the degree of reimbursement by public and private insurance organizations  and the competition we face from others within our industry 
financial position cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments excluding all restricted amounts at december   were approximately million  compared to approximately million as of december  this increase resulted from the continued growth in sales of remodulin offset  in part  by expenditures related primarily to funding the construction and acquisition of real property 
restricted cash and marketable investments of million at december   comprise approximately million pledged as security for our financing arrangements related to our silver spring  maryland laboratory facility phase i laboratory and approximately million placed in a rabbi trust to fund our supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
at december   approximately million was pledged as security for our phase i laboratory and approximately million was placed in the rabbi trust 
property  plant and equipment at december   was approximately million  up million from approximately million at december  since december   we have funded approximately million toward the construction of our facilities in north carolina and maryland 
construction of the north carolina facility was completed in february and the maryland facility is expected to be complete in late additionally  as of september   we capitalized million and recognized a corresponding lease obligation associated with our phase i laboratory see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
lastly  we 
table of contents purchased a building in the united kingdom for approximately million in august to serve as the new headquarters for our wholly owned subsidiary  united therapeutics europe  ltd 
noncurrent deferred tax assets increased by approximately million from approximately million at december   to million at december   primarily as a result of the deferred tax asset created by expensing the million upfront payment to lilly pursuant to a license agreement and a related manufacturing and supply agreement regarding the rights to commercialize tadalafil for pulmonary hypertension 
for tax purposes  the million upfront payment is considered to be a tax intangible asset which is expensed for tax purposes over an expected year period 
accounts payable increased by approximately million from approximately million at december  to million at december  we attribute this increase to the timing of payments based on our semi monthly payment cycle and the timing and volume of activity with respect to our construction projects 
the classification of approximately million of our convertible senior notes due october convertible senior notes shifted from a current liability at december   to a non current liability at december   because contingent conversion criteria had not been satisfied at december  specifically  the closing price of our common stock did not exceed of the initial conversion price for more than days during the consecutive trading day period ending on december  as a result  the convertible senior notes were not convertible at the election of their holders note holders 
this conversion determination is measured as of the end of each quarter 
accordingly  classification of the convertible senior notes may change in future quarters 
stockholders equity was approximately million at december   compared to approximately million at december  the net increase of million in stockholders equity was driven in large part by the following significant transactions during the year ended december  additional paid in capital increased by approximately million as a result of the receipt of million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during  the recognition of million in stock option based compensation expense  and the recognition of million in tax benefits primarily associated with share based compensation 
treasury stock decreased by approximately million 
the decrease represents the cost basis of approximately million treasury shares that we issued to lilly in december in exchange for million pursuant to our november stock purchase agreement 
this transaction was one of several pursuant to agreements entered into with lilly regarding the license  manufacture and supply of tadalafil for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension 
our accumulated deficit rose by approximately million during the year ended december  due to our million net loss incurred for the year ended december  and the loss we recognized in connection with the issuance of treasury stock to lilly 
the excess of the cost basis of the treasury shares issued over the purchase price of approximately million was included in our accumulated deficit 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the growth in revenues experienced during resulted in large part from the increase in the number of patients prescribed remodulin 

table of contents the following table presents the components of net revenues dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change remodulin telemedicine services and products distributor fees other products total revenues for the year ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of net remodulin revenues were earned from our three distributors located in the united states

expenses associated with our inhaled and oral treprostinil programs increased by approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in expenditures related to these programs resulted from activities associated with the progression of ongoing clinical trials  the filing for regulatory approval for inhaled treprostinil in the united states and eu  and the announcement of results of the freedom c trial 
in addition  during the year ended december   expenses incurred in connection with the development of beraprost mr rose by approximately million when compared to the year ended december  this increase was largely attributable to milestone payments made to toray pursuant to our license agreement for the development of beraprost mr 
lastly  the growth during of our clinical staff to focus on new and investigational cardiovascular projects resulted in a corresponding increase in salaries and related expenses of approximately million 
cardiovascular license fees 
during the quarter ended december   we made a one time  upfront payment of million pursuant to a license agreement and a related manufacturing and supply agreement entered into with lilly regarding the commercialization of tadalafil 
we expensed these payments as research and development since tadalafil has not been approved for marketing by the fda and therefore commercial feasibility has not yet been demonstrated 
cancer projects 
in december  we terminated our ovarian cancer program based on the results of the impact i and ii trials relating to ovarex 
consequently  expenditures associated with our cancer programs decreased substantially in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  share based compensation 
the increase in share based compensation in resulted from achievement awards in connection with the attainment of specific company wide performance milestones of which a portion is paid with awards granted under share tracking awards plan stap  and an increase in the number of employees during the

the increase in general and administrative expenses in reflects in part headcount growth and corresponding personnel related expenses of approximately million as we expanded our administrative staff to support the anticipated growth of our business 
in addition  professional fees rose by approximately million in and relate to services provided in connection with prospective and consummated business transactions during the year 
the increases in personnel related expenses and professional fees were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in impairment related charges during sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   personnel related costs increased by approximately million as a direct result of increases in departmental headcount 
in addition  expenses associated with new marketing campaigns and initiatives and other promotional activities rose by approximately million during share based compensation 
during the year ended december   we recognized share based compensation expense of approximately million  representing the fair value of the chief executive officer s year end stock option grant  which is determined based on a formula set forth in her employment agreement 
based on this formula  our chief executive officer did not receive a stock option grant for the year ended december  the decrease in share based compensation recognized relating to this award was partially offset by an increase in share based compensation of approximately million in and resulted from achievement awards in connection with the attainment of specific company wide performance milestones of which a portion is paid with awards granted under the stap  and an increase in the number of employees during the income tax benefit 
as a result of our net loss incurred before income taxes for the year ended december   we recognized income tax benefits of million for the year then ended 
for the year ended december   we recognized income tax benefits of approximately million  resulting principally from the generation of business tax credits during the year for our orphan drug related research and development activities 
years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the year ended december

for the year ended december   the increase in our cancer program expenses  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily related to the development of our ovarex manufacturing processes 
research and development license fee expense is related to the  shares of our common stock issued to toray under our amended license agreement for beraprost mr 
the table below summarizes selling  general and administrative expense by major categories dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change category general and administrative sales and marketing impairment charges stock option total selling  general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased expenses of approximately million for salaries and related expenses from headcount growth to support expanding operations  and million for other operating expenses supporting the growth in our operations 
the increase in sales and marketing related expenses was the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses of approximately million primarily due to an increase in staffing and an increase in travel expenses of approximately million 
in november  we settled an arginine infringement case and the million settlement payment that we received was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense 
under the terms of her employment agreement  as amended  our chief executive officer is entitled to receive stock options in december of each calendar year based on the average closing price of our common stock for the month of december 
at december   we granted her options to purchase  shares of our common stock  which represents one eighteenth of one percent of the increase in our market capitalization from its average in december based on the average closing price of our common stock for the month of december our stock market capitalization increased approximately billion from january   to december  we recognized stock option 
table of contents expense in december of approximately million  representing the fair market value of these stock options in excess of the million recognized at september  our market capitalization increased by approximately million from september   to december  the offset to this expense was an increase to additional paid in capital 
an impairment of the intangible assets related to the heartbar product trade name totaling approximately million was recorded during the year ended december  this impairment was required since the heartbar product was discontinued in january and is no longer sold 
in september  based on a united states supreme court decision concerning the enforceability of patents and a publication discounting the benefits of arginine supplementation  we decided to discontinue selling any arginine related products and we reevaluated our assumptions used in determining the recoverability of our arginine patents 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recorded 
in december  based on the announcement of the failure of our impact i and ii phase iii trials of ovarex for advanced ovarian cancer  the stock price of virexx medical corp 
declined 
we considered this decline to be an other than temporary impairment of approximately million 
based on the quoted market price at december   the book value of our virexx investment was approximately  cost of product sales was approximately of net product sales for each of the years ended december  and cost of service sales was approximately and of service sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized income tax benefit of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax benefit generated for was primarily due to the amount of tax credits generated during the year from our orphan drug related research and development activities 
for the year ended december   the tax benefit recognized was due primarily to reductions of approximately million in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on our determination that certain of these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realizable 
liquidity and capital resources subsequent to the fda s initial approval of remodulin in  we have funded our operations principally from remodulin related revenues and expect to do so in the future 
we believe that our existing revenues and working capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations as demand for remodulin has grown steadily since and our customer base remains stable 
furthermore  we believe that our customer base presents minimal credit risk 
we have several therapies that are in the later stages of development and believe that  if approved for marketing  they will augment future revenue growth and cash flows 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are inherently subject to uncertainty 
to compensate for such uncertainty  we may raise additional cash in the future and believe we have options and the ability to do so 
see item a risk factors we have a history of losses and may not maintain profitability and item a risk factors we may fail to meet third party projections for our revenue or profits 
operating cash flows and working capital net cash used by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million in net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  the decrease in operating cash flows was driven by a one time upfront payment of million to lilly for the license rights to tadalafil  pursuant to the licensing and the manufacturing and supply agreements which became effective in december the related one time fee was expensed as research and development in december  and was the principal factor that led to our net loss for the year 
in a related transaction  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock from treasury to lilly for million pursuant to a stock purchase agreement entered into with lilly in connection with the acquisition of license rights to tadalafil 
as such  collectively  our transactions with lilly had no impact on net cash flows 

table of contents at december   we had working capital of approximately million compared to approximately million at december  the increase in working capital corresponded to the classification of convertible senior notes as a non current liability because contingent conversion criteria had not been satisfied at december  specifically  the closing price of our common stock did not exceed of the initial conversion price for more than days during the consecutive trading day period ending on december  as a result  the convertible senior notes were not convertible at the election of the note holders as of december  this conversion determination is measured as of the end of each quarter 
accordingly  classification of the convertible senior notes may change in future quarters 
however  it is our expectation  based on our understanding of the historical behavior of holders of convertible notes with terms similar to ours  that most  if not all of our outstanding convertible senior notes will be held until they mature in october the increase in working capital for the year ended on december   was offset in part by the decrease in cash and short term investments of approximately million as we invested excess cash in long term marketable investments  the funding of our construction projects in north carolina and maryland  and the increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately million as a result of the timing of disbursements  the increased volume of activity with respect to our construction projects and the recognition of a liability associated with our stap 
auction rate securities at december   we held approximately million par value of illiquid non current municipal notes with an auction reset feature ars 
the decline in value of these securities reflects market related liquidity conditions resulting from the general collapse of the credit markets and not the issuers creditworthiness 
the ars are collateralized by student loan portfolios that are approximately guaranteed by the federal government and maintain a credit rating of aaa 
historically  these securities provided liquidity to investors through their interest rate reset feature ie  interest rates on these securities are reset through a bidding process or auction at frequent  pre determined intervals typically every to days 
at each reset date  investors could either rollover and maintain their holdings or liquidate them at par value 
since february  auctions related to our ars have failed as a result of the deterioration of the credit markets  rendering these securities illiquid 
in november  we entered into an auction rate securities rights offer rights offer with the investment firm that maintains our ars account 
pursuant to the rights offer  we can sell the ars to the investment firm for a price equal to the par value of these securities at any time between june  and july  put option 
in addition  at any time through july   the investment firm  acting as principal  can purchase the ars from us or sell them on our behalf provided that the par value of the ars is deposited in our account on the next business day following settlement of the transaction 
while we believe we have the ability to hold these investments until the credit markets improve sufficiently to allow us to liquidate the ars without realizing significant losses  we entered into the rights offer to provide us with additional flexibility to recover the full cost of our investment prior to maturity of these securities 
in addition  to help meet any immediate liquidity needs  the rights offer provides that we can borrow up to the par value of the ars 
the rights offer and the related put option  however  carries with it counterparty credit risk 
based on our anticipated cash requirements and cash flows  we do not believe that the risks associated with the ars will have a material impact on our ability to meet our obligations 
construction projects in february  we completed the construction of a facility in research triangle park  north carolina rtp facility  which includes a manufacturing operation and offices 
the facility is approximately  square feet 
the manufacturing operation will be used primarily to formulate oral treprostinil 
in addition  it is expected that the rtp facility will support the production and 
table of contents distribution of other drug candidates that we are developing 
the offices are used by our clinical development and sales and marketing staffs 
in december  we began construction of a combination office and laboratory facility that will attach to our phase i laboratory in silver spring  maryland phase ii facility 
projected costs to construct this facility are anticipated to be million 
in november  we agreed to the terms of a construction management agreement with the whiting turner contracting company whiting turner relating to the construction of the phase ii facility gmp contract 
under the terms of the gmp contract  costs to complete the construction of the phase ii facility generally cannot exceed million the guaranteed maximum price 
the guaranteed maximum price excludes certain costs of construction that we expect to incur and that have been included in our projected costs to complete the phase ii facility 
whiting turner will be responsible for any cost overruns above the guaranteed maximum price and will share a portion of the savings in the event costs of constructing the phase ii facility are less than the guaranteed maximum price 
in addition  whiting turner is subject to penalties in the event that construction of the phase ii facility is not completed by november   unless an agreed upon change order alters the scope of work set forth under the gmp contract 
we spent approximately million and million relating to the construction of the rtp facility and phase ii facility  respectively  during as of december   inception to date expenditures approached million on these two construction projects 
we expect to continue to fund our construction projects using our existing cash and cash flows to be generated by our operations 
share tracking awards plan effective june   we adopted the stap 
awards granted under the stap entitle participants to receive in cash the appreciation in our common stock  which is calculated as the positive difference between the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the date of exercise 
accordingly  the stap could require substantial cash payments as awards vest and participants begin exercising them 
our operating budgets incorporate anticipated outlays of cash relating to the stap  and we believe future cash flows will be sufficient to accommodate our obligations under the stap and the future operating requirements of our business 
license fees under our existing license agreements  we are obligated to make royalty payments on sales of remodulin that exceed annual net sales of million 
royalty obligations on sales of currently marketed products range up to percent of related sales 
convertible senior notes on october   we issued at par value million of convertible senior notes 
we pay interest on the convertible senior notes in arrears semi annually on april and october of each year approximately million annually 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations that rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the initial conversion price is per share 
conversion can occur i anytime after july   ii during any calendar quarter that follows a calendar quarter in which the price of our common stock exceeded of the initial conversion price for at least days during the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the quarter  iii during the ten consecutive trading day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the convertible senior notes was less than of the closing price of our common stock multiplied by the then current conversion rate  or iv upon specified distributions to our shareholders  corporate transactions  or in the event that our common stock ceases to be listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq and is not listed for trading on another us national or regional securities exchange 

table of contents upon conversion  a note holder will receive i cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value equal to the number of shares underlying the convertible senior notes multiplied by the then current conversion price per share  and ii to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note  shares of our common stock 
in the event of a change in control  as defined in the indenture under which the convertible senior notes have been issued  note holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible senior notes for of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  plus shares of our common stock 
lease obligation we currently lease the phase i laboratory pursuant to a synthetic lease arrangement lease entered into in june with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia 
under the lease  wachovia funded million toward the construction of the phase i laboratory on land we own 
subsequent to the completion of construction in may  wachovia leased the phase i laboratory to us 
monthly rent is equal to the day london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points as of december  applied to the amount wachovia funded toward construction 
the base term of the lease ends in may base term 
upon the end of the base term  we will have the right to exercise one of the following options under the lease renew the lease for an additional five year term subject to the approval of both parties  purchase the phase i laboratory from wachovia for approximately million  or sell the phase i laboratory and repay wachovia s construction costs with the proceeds from the sale 
if sales proceeds are insufficient to repay wachovia s construction costs  we must fund the shortfall up to the maximum residual value guarantee of approximately million 
from the inception of the lease through august  we accounted for the lease as an off balance sheet arrangement  ie  an operating lease 
since december  we have been constructing the phase ii facility with funds generated from our operations 
as of september   substantial structural progress had been made in the construction of the phase ii facility 
in addition  we received wachovia s acknowledgement of our plan to make structural modifications to the phase i laboratory in order to connect it to the phase ii facility 
as a result  we could no longer consider the phase i laboratory a standalone structure  which was required to maintain operating lease classification 
consequently  as of september   we were considered the owners of the phase i laboratory for accounting purposes 
because the lease failed to meet criteria set forth in eitf issue no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  we are accounting for the lease as a financing obligation 
accordingly  as of september   we capitalized the estimated fair value of the phase i laboratory  totaling million  and recognized a corresponding lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are accreting increasing the lease obligation to million  the purchase price of the phase i laboratory  through the recognition of periodic interest charges using the effective interest method 
the accretion period began on september   and will run through the end of the base term 
interest charges related to the accretion of the lease obligation for the year ended december   were approximately  in addition  we are depreciating the phase i laboratory over its estimated economic useful life 
the change in accounting recognition of the lease did not affect our cash flow requirements under the arrangement 
using the day libor as of december   plus basis points  our estimated annual rent under the lease would be  approximately million of our marketable investments at december  have been pledged as collateral for the lease and are included within restricted marketable investments and cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
common stock subject to repurchase in march  we amended our june agreement with toray to expand our rights to commercialize beraprost mr 
pursuant to our amended agreement  we issued  shares of our 
table of contents common stock to toray in march the terms of our amended agreement give toray the right to request that we repurchase these shares at the price of per share upon days prior written notice 
to date  we have not received notification from toray that they would like us to repurchase these shares 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years convertible senior notes lease obligation operating lease obligations construction commitment obligations under the stap purchase commitments milestone payments total the principal balance of the convertible senior notes is to be repaid in cash 
convertibility may vary depending on whether our stock price meets specified criteria which is determined on a quarterly basis 
the lease obligation assumes that the purchase option will be elected at the end of the base term 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the arrangement 
representing our remaining obligations under agreements currently in effect relating to our construction projects in silver spring  maryland and research triangle park  north carolina 
we estimated the obligation based on the intrinsic value of outstanding stap awards expected to vest as of december  assuming that awards will be exercised immediately upon vesting 
we license products from other companies under various license agreements 
these agreements generally require that we make specific cash payments upon the achievement of specific product development milestones and commercialization 
the timing and amounts of related milestone payments have been estimated based on when we believe milestones will be achieved  and the assumption that all milestones established within these license agreements will be successfully attained 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the contractual obligations disclosed above exclude these amounts due to the uncertainty surrounding the amounts and timing of future payments 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions can change and impact amounts reported in the future 
we have identified the following accounting policies  which require the use of our judgment and estimation in their application 
we consider these policies to be critical because of the degree of judgment that is inherent in their application 
sales of remodulin sales of remodulin  including related pumps and supplies  are recognized when title and risk of ownership pass to our distributors  which occurs upon delivery 
we record sales of remodulin and related equipment and supplies net of product sales allowances 
these sales allowances consist of prompt payment discounts  medicaid rebates and fees paid to distributors 
calculating these allowances involves the use of significant estimates and judgments and information from external sources 
sales allowances are estimated and recognized as reductions to revenue in the period that associated revenues are recognized 
prompt pay discounts are calculated based on the gross amount of invoices and are recorded on a net basis as our distributors have routinely taken advantage of these discounts 
medicaid rebates are generally invoiced and paid in the subsequent quarter from the date of sale 
accruals and related revenue reductions for medicaid rebates are based on historical rebate data adjusted for anticipated changes in product sales trends and government rebate programs with regard to eligibility requirements and or rebate pricing 
we pay two of our distributors service fees 
accruals for these fees are estimated based on contracted rates applied to the estimated units of service provided by distributors for a given period 
our distributors do not possess return rights  however  we provide exchange rights in the event that product was damaged during shipment  or has expired 
we account for exchange rights in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas 
the shelf life of remodulin is years from the date of its manufacture  accordingly  an exchange for expired vials generally occurs months after a vial is sold 
the financial effects of this exchange right have been immaterial and we expect the historic volume of exchanges to remain consistent in the future 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has historically been minimal given the fast pace at which our products move through the distribution channel 
specifically  product exchanges have comprised substantially less than of the volume of vials that we sell 
as such  reserves for exchange rights are not recognized in the period of sale  unless product expiration or damage occurs during shipment and are known to us 
we closely monitor levels of inventory in the distribution channels for contractual compliance and do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in the ordinary course of business 
marketable investments pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas we are required to periodically review our marketable investments to determine whether a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
this review requires us to make judgments  particularly as they relate to the materiality and duration of a decline in the value of a security  the probability  extent and timing of a recovery in a security s value  and our ability and intent to hold a security until we can recover our initial cost  or until maturity 
the scope of this evaluation requires forward looking assessments pertaining to a security and the relevant financial markets  as well as an issuer s financial condition and business outlook 
accordingly  we must make assessments regarding current conditions  as well as future events  which involve a considerable degree of 
table of contents uncertainty 
when we determine that the decline in value of a security is other than temporary  we are required to recognize an impairment charge within our consolidated statement of operations and establish a new cost basis for the security at its then current fair value 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment charge of million within earnings related to our investments in ars 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a complete discussion 
in addition  pursuant to sfas  we classify certain marketable investments as held to maturity because we believe we have the positive intent and ability to hold related securities until they mature 
this assertion requires us to make forward looking judgments regarding our future cash flow requirements relative to the maturity dates of such securities 
to reduce the level of uncertainty associated in making this determination  we invest in securities that do not possess extended maturities 
fair value measurements sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  requires that we disclose assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements within a fair value hierarchy sfas hierarchy 
the sfas hierarchy gives the highest priority to fair value measurements based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to fair value measurements derived through the use of unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified within the sfas hierarchy  in their entirety  based on the lowest level input that is significant to the related fair value measurement 
determining where within the fair value hierarchy a particular asset or liability should be disclosed involves judgment regarding the significance of inputs relative to a fair value measurement and where such inputs lie within the sfas hierarchy 
furthermore  securities that are illiquid  or are not traded  have little or no price transparency level measurements 
as such  estimating the fair value of our level securities involves the use of significant subjective assumptions that we believe market participants would consider in pricing such securities 
we employ a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our level securities 
accordingly  inputs to the model that include estimating the amounts and timing of expected cash flows  the expected term of the securities and a discount rate appropriately adjusted for illiquidity or other risks involve a significant degree of judgment 
investment in affiliate we use the equity method of accounting for our investment in northern therapeutics  inc northern 
the equity method of accounting requires that we report our share of our northern s net losses or earnings in our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation is not required unless we possess the ability to control northern 
generally  the ability to exercise control over an entity occurs when voting interests in that entity exceed 
we maintain an ownership interest in northern of approximately 
however  because northern s minority owners have substantive participation rights as described in eitf issue no 
 investors accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  we concluded that we do not have the ability to control northern s operations 
therefore  northern s financial statements have not been included in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the asset and liability method set forth under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets 
table of contents are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
evaluating the realizability of deferred assets requires us to review forecasts of earnings and taxable income  among other considerations 
accordingly  the evaluation process as it relates to the realizability of deferred tax assets requires us to make significant judgments and forward looking assessments regarding amounts and the availability of future taxable income 
we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more likely than not threshold of that position being sustained 
if the tax position meets this threshold  the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
application of fin involves considerable judgment in assessing the future tax consequences of amounts that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in amounts different from those recognized on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we are required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
evaluating goodwill for impairment requires judgment particularly as it relates to determining the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
we generally use a discounted cash flow model to test goodwill for impairment  which involves the use of significant and subjective inputs 
related inputs  among others  requiring our judgment include the estimation of future cash flows  future growth rates and profitability of a reporting unit and the expected life related cash flows will occur 
changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its estimated fair value 
phase i laboratory lease we currently lease the phase i laboratory pursuant to the lease we entered into in june with wachovia 
under the lease  wachovia funded million toward the construction of the phase i laboratory on land we own 
subsequent to the completion of construction in may  wachovia leased the phase i laboratory to us 
upon the end of the base term in may  we will have the right to exercise one of the following options under the lease renew the lease for an additional five year term subject to the approval of both parties  purchase the phase i laboratory from wachovia for approximately million  or sell the phase i laboratory and repay wachovia s construction costs with the proceeds from the sale 
if such sales proceeds are insufficient to repay wachovia s construction costs  we must fund the shortfall up to the maximum residual value guarantee of approximately million 
from the inception of the lease through the quarter ended june   we accounted for the lease as an operating lease an off balance sheet arrangement 
since december  we have been constructing the phase ii facility with funds generated from our operations 
as of september   substantial structural progress had been made in the construction of the phase ii facility 
in addition  we received wachovia s acknowledgement of our plan to make structural modifications to the phase i laboratory in order to connect it to the phase ii facility 
as a result  the phase i laboratory is no longer considered a standalone structure  which is required to maintain off balance sheet accounting for the lease 
consequently  as of september   we were considered the owners of the phase i laboratory for accounting purposes 
because the lease failed to meet criteria set forth in eitf issue no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  and sfas no 
 accounting for leases  we are accounting for the lease as a 
table of contents financing obligation 
accordingly  as of september   we capitalized the estimated fair value of the phase i laboratory  totaling million  and recognized a corresponding lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are accreting the lease obligation to million  the purchase price of the phase i laboratory  through the recognition of periodic interest charges using the effective interest method 
the accretion period began on september  and will run through may in addition  we are depreciating the phase i laboratory over its estimated economic useful life 
pension benefit obligation we account for the serp in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  and related standards and interpretations 
accordingly  we recognize on our consolidated balance sheet a liability equal to the unfunded status of the serp equal to the projected benefit obligation  as we do not fund the serp and measure our projected benefit obligation as of the end of our fiscal year 
estimating the serp obligation involves the use of judgments and estimates 
the serp obligation and related pension expense are derived from actuarial valuations that are developed using a number of assumptions 
a key assumption to the valuation is the discount rate 
the discount rate should be representative of the rate associated with high quality  fixed income debt securities 
changes in the discount rate can significantly impact the measurement of the serp obligation 
other actuarial assumptions include participant demographics such as the expected rate of salary increases and withdrawal rates  among others 
actual experience may differ from actuarial assumptions 
changes in any of these assumptions can also affect the measurement of the serp obligation 
share based compensation we account for share based awards in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  and related interpretive guidance 
our share based awards are classified as either equity stock options or as liabilities stap awards and compensation expense to be recognized is determined based on the fair value of related awards 
we estimate the fair value of these awards using the black scholes merton valuation model 
valuation models  like the black scholes merton model  require the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized 
these assumptions include  among others  the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of awards and the expected forfeiture rate 
developing these assumptions requires the use of judgment 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
fsp apb applies to certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets  or partially in cash  upon conversion 
issuers of such instruments are required under fsp apb to account for the liability and equity components separately in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest expense is subsequently recognized 
specifically  fsp apb requires the difference between the convertible debt proceeds and the fair value of the liability  absent any conversion rights  to be assigned to the equity component and recognized as part of stockholders equity and as a discount for determining the carrying value of the debt 
the discounted carrying value of the debt is amortized as interest expense using the interest method over the expected life of the debt 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
our convertible senior notes fall within the scope of fsp apb see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
while adoption of fsp apb will not change the cash flow requirements of our convertible senior notes  non cash interest expense 
table of contents associated with the amortization of the discount on the convertible senior notes is expected to increase significantly 
upon the adoption of fsp apb  we will no longer recognize interest expense based on the convertible senior notes stated rate of interest 
the expected impact of the retrospective application of fsp apb from the period of issuance october through the end of the senior convertible notes expected life excluding any effects of capitalized interest and income taxes is shown below in thousands year ended december  interest expense based on the stated rate of interest interest expense under fsp apb incremental impact of adoption of fsp apb total debt discount and equity component to be recognized under fsp apb n a n a  through october  the end of the expected life of the convertible senior notes

eitf supersedes eitf issue no 
 the meaning of indexed to a company s own stock  and provides guidance in evaluating whether certain financial instruments or embedded features can be excluded from the scope of sfas no  accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas 
eitf sets forth a two step approach that evaluates an instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions for the purpose of determining whether such instruments are indexed to an issuer s own stock a requirement necessary to comply with the scope exception under sfas 
eitf will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact related to the adoption of eitf on our financial instruments that fall within its scope

 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of non governmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap gaap hierarchy 
sfas became effective november  adoption of sfas did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires companies to provide enhanced disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires companies to better convey the purpose of derivative use in terms of the risks they intend to manage 
disclosures required under sfas include a how and why a company uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas retains the same scope as sfas and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this statement is effective  prospectively  for fiscal years beginning after december  except for certain retrospective disclosure requirements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements upon initial adoption

revised  business combinations a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas r 
sfas r significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
sfas r is effective  prospectively  for fiscal years beginning after december   except for certain retrospective adjustments to deferred tax balances 
the potential impact of adopting sfas r on our consolidated financial statements will depend on whether we enter into any future acquisitions and the magnitude of such acquisitions

we are assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of eitf will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we hold investments of approximately million par value in ars 
we are exposed to market risk related to the ars as a result of the general collapse of the credit markets and the continued uncertainty surrounding the financial markets 
the ars maintain an aaa credit rating and are backed by student loan portfolios that are approximately guaranteed by the federal government 
however  since february  auctions for the ars have failed  rendering these securities illiquid 
consequently  the fair value of the ars has continued to decline in value 
through november  we classified the ars as available for sale and accounted for the decline in their value as temporary within other comprehensive losses equity based on our intent and ability to hold these securities until they recover their value 
however  upon our entering into the rights offer in november  we could no longer assert our positive intent to hold these securities indefinitely 
consequently  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of approximately million within earnings during the quarter ended december  concurrently  we reclassified the ars from the available for sale to the trading category 
with this transfer into the trading classification  all future changes in fair value of the ars will be recognized within earnings until the securities are liquidated or otherwise disposed 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that the ars will ever fully recover their value 
to mitigate the risks associated with our investment  we entered into the rights offer  under which we have a put option that gives us the ability to require the investment firm the counterparty to the rights offer to repurchase the ars at a price equal to their par value during a specific period beginning in june the put option has been recognized at fair value as a financial asset on our consolidated balance sheet at december  subsequent changes in the fair value of the put option will be recognized within earnings 
we expect the future price movements relating to the 
table of contents ars and the put option to largely offset one another ie  as the value of the ars decreases  we would expect the rights associated with the put option to increase in value 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for a complete discussion of the ars and the rights offer 
at december   we have invested approximately million in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments varies inversely with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
similarly  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to minimize market risk  we hold related investments until maturity so that they can be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   our investments in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies had a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately 
these investments mature at various times through december and are callable annually 
there has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk 
the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of such securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
in light of the current market conditions and these additional risks  we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest 
we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly rated securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities that we believe involve a higher degree of risk 
while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks  such risks cannot be fully eliminated  as there are circumstances outside of our control  as noted above in the discussion of our ars
