the company issued million of senior convertible notes during fiscal year in conjunction with the offering the company received million from the issuance of warrants  paid million for the purchase of a convertible note hedge  and paid debt issuance costs of approximately million 
during fiscal year  the holders of million in principal face value senior convertible notes exercised their contractual rights to require the company to repurchase their notes for a cash repurchase price equal to of the principal face value of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the company used approximately million in available cash on hand from the issuance of million of senior convertible notes and million from the revolving line of credit to fund the repurchase of such notes and accrued interest on march   for approximately million 
during fiscal years and  the company repaid approximately million and borrowed approximately million  respectively on its revolving line of credit 
these borrowings were used to fund a portion of the company s share repurchases  debt repurchase  acquisition activities  investment strategies  and operating activities during the periods 
there were no borrowings on the company s line of credit during fiscal year capital resources the capital and credit markets have recently experienced adverse conditions 
the resulting restricted access to capital along with significant volatility within capital markets have increased the costs associated with issuing or refinancing debt because of increased risk spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks 
the company continues to be well positioned  however  there can be no guarantee the recent disruptions in the overall economy and the financial markets will not adversely impact the business and results of operations 
the company finances its business primarily through cash generated from operations  proceeds from the million senior convertible notes offering and the million revolving line of credit 
the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand for the company s products and services  and access to products and services from suppliers 
given current operating  economic and industry conditions  management believes demand for products and services will grow at slower rates 
the company s capital structure provides the financial resources to support the business strategies of customer service and revenue growth 
the revolving line of credit  which is an asset based agreement  is primarily collateralized by the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
the company s long term priorities for use of capital are internal growth  acquisitions  and repurchase of the company s common stock

a note holder may not exercise his her conversion right with respect to all or any portion of a note  if such conversion would cause the note holder to become a beneficial owner of more than of the company s outstanding voting stock 
the initial conversion rate is shares of common stock per each in thousands principal amount of notes and is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment if certain events occur  such as stock dividends or other distributions of cash  securities  indebtedness or assets  stock splits and combinations  issuances of rights or warrants  tender offers  or repurchases 
as of march   the fair value of the senior convertible notes was approximately million 
refer to footnote  debt  for a detailed discussion regarding the senior convertible notes 
the ability of note holders to convert is assessed on a quarterly basis and is dependent on the trading price of the company s stock during the last trading days of each quarter

the purchased options will expire upon the earlier of i the last day the notes remain outstanding or ii the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes 
the purchased options are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes in the event that the market value per share of the common stock  as measured under the notes  at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the notes

the warrants are separate transactions  entered into by the company with the counterparties  and are not part of the terms of the notes 
holders of the notes do not have any rights with respect to the warrants 
revolving line of credit the company had million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit at march  the credit agreement permits maximum borrowings of up to million  which may be increased to million 
after reducing availability for outstanding borrowings and letter of credit commitments  the company has sufficient assets based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory to borrow an additional million and million excluding the additional increase of million under the revolving line of credit at march  and march   respectively

table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the company periodically evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements  which are then reviewed by the company s audit committee 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions considered reasonable with the relevant facts and circumstances 
based on the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
the critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require the company s management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimates or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
additionally  the company includes those accounting estimates whose initial application had a material impact on the company s financial presentation  unless the application resulted solely from the issuance of new accounting literature 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician business  elder care business  and corporate shared services  unless otherwise noted 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade receivables resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from its customers 
the allowances include estimates of specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but may later become uncollectible 
management believes the estimates used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are critical accounting estimates because changes in credit worthiness and economic conditions  including bankruptcies  have had a material impact on operations in previous fiscal years and could have an impact on the company s results from operations in the near future 
the estimates used to determine the allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  and changes in customer payment terms 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
adjustments to credit limits and allowances for bad debts are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or improve  allowances may be adjusted  impacting general and administrative expenses and the accounts receivable balance 
during fiscal years through  the physician business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively  for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million  million and million  respectively 
during the fiscal years through  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has represented between and of the physician business trade receivable balance 
at march  and march   the allowance for doubtful accounts for this business segment was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  the physician business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million 
if management were to assume its reserve estimates at march  were based on the historic ranges noted above  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march  would range from million to million for the physician business 

table of contents during fiscal years through  the elder business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively  for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million  million and million 
during fiscal years through  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has represented between and of the elder care business trade receivable balance 
at march  and march   the allowance for doubtful accounts for this business segment was million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  the elder business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million 
if management were to assume its reserve estimates at march  were based on the historic ranges noted above  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march  would range from million to million for the elder care business 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions  and changes in customer s credit worthiness could materially affect the company s financial results 
inventories in order to state inventories medical products  medical equipment  and other related products at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method or market net realizable value  the company maintains an allowance for excess or slow moving inventory based on the expectation that certain inventory will become obsolete  sold for less than cost  or become unsaleable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as historical trends  current market conditions and management s assessment of when the inventory would likely be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory would likely be sold in the normal course of business 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences or the loss of a customer may result in an unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin and net income 
obsolete or damaged inventory is disposed of or written down to net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
additional adjustments  if necessary  are made based on management s specific review of inventory on hand 
management believes the estimates used in determining the allowance for excess and slow moving inventory are critical accounting estimates as changes in the estimates for both segments could have a material impact on net income and the estimates involve a high degree of judgment 
as part of the company s periodic review of the carrying amount of inventory during fiscal year  management determined that a write down of approximately million  net of recoveries  was required for excess influenza vaccine inventory resulting from the cancellation of customer orders due to an oversupply of the flu vaccine in the market  and a mild influenza season 
as a result of the write down  cost of goods sold were increased by million during the fiscal year ended march   or million net of tax  in the physician business 
during fiscal year  the company did not participate in the influenza vaccine market 
during fiscal year  the company participated in this market on an agency basis and therefore did not have inventory risk 
inventory allowances ranged from to of inventory for the physician business and to of inventory for the elder care business during fiscal years through at march   management estimated the required allowance for excess or slow moving inventory to be approximately million and million for the physician business and elder care business  respectively 
if management were to assume inventory write offs were based on the historic ranges noted above  the allowance for excess and slow moving inventory as of march  would range from million and million for the physician business and million and million for the elder care business  impacting the company s inventory and gross profit balances 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to inventory reserves are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results 

table of contents vendor rebates the company receives transaction based rebates from third party suppliers 
such rebates are classified as a reduction to cost of goods sold in the accompanying statements of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
management establishes a reserve for uncollectible transaction based vendor rebates based on management s judgment after considering the status of current outstanding rebate claims  historical denial experience with suppliers  and any other pertinent available information 
management believes the estimates used in determining the reserve for uncollectible transaction based vendor rebates are critical accounting estimates because changes in the estimates could have a material impact on net income and the estimates involve a high degree of judgment 
reserves for transaction based rebates for the year ended march  and march  were million and million  respectively 
reserves ranged from to of rebates receivable during fiscal years through if management were to assume outstanding future rebate receivable write offs based on the upper and lower end of the historical range developed in the course of formulating the estimate  the transaction based rebate reserve as of march  would range from million to million  impacting the company s prepaid and other current assets balance and gross profit 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to vendor rebates are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method for determining its provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
under this method  the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  significant judgment and estimates are used as management considers short and long term forecasts of future taxable income as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these judgments and estimates include some degree of uncertainty and changes could require management to adjust the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the company had gross deferred income tax assets of million and million at march  and march   respectively 
there were no valuation allowances as of march  and march   as management believes it will fully utilize the company s deferred tax assets before their expiration 
the company s tax filings are periodically subject to review by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities  which may result in assessments of additional tax 
resolution of these situations  either with the taxing authority or the courts  inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly  the company provides taxes only for the amounts management believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
management s experience has been that the estimates and assumptions used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that adjustments resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
during fiscal year  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas no 
fin which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
this standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes 
fin requires management to make significant 
table of contents judgments while assessing the probability of possible outcomes of future tax examinations 
upon adoption of fin  effective april   the company recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of million and a decrease to stockholders equity of approximately million 
at march   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million 
management does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
if our estimates or judgments described above were to change  a hypothetical change in our effective tax rate would impact consolidated income from continuing operations by approximately million in fiscal year valuation of intangible assets  other long lived assets  and goodwill acquisitions the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in the valuation of acquired assets include  but are not limited to i expected future cash flows from existing customer contracts and relationships  ii assumptions relating to the impact of noncompete agreements on business operations  iii assumptions related to the impact on the timing of expected future cash flows  iv retention of customers and key business leaders  and v the risk inherent in investing in intangible assets 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates  or other actual results 
for these reasons  management believes the estimates used in determining the fair value of assets acquired through an acquisition are critical accounting estimates 
during fiscal years through  the company made acquisitions for an initial purchase price of million 
adjustments to the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities subsequent to the date of purchase based on changes in management s original estimates were immaterial to the current and previous three fiscal years 
impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting unit annually on the last day of each fiscal year 
the impairment and disposal of long lived assets is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
in conducting the impairment analysis  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which may include discounted cash flow analyses requiring management to make certain assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  revenues  earnings  and other factors  including discount rates  to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
the application of different assumptions about such matters as estimated future cash flows or discount rates  or the testing for impairment at a different level of the organization or on a different organization structure  may produce materially different results 
for these reasons  management believes the estimates used in evaluating the company s goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  and long lived assets are critical accounting estimates 
based on management s review  goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets were not impaired during fiscal years   and as of march  and march   the company s intangible asset  
table of contents other long lived asset  and goodwill balances totaled million  million 
based on management s review  goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets were not impaired during fiscal year and management does not believe there were any circumstances which indicated the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable in the future 
additionally  a hypothetical change in the discount rate utilized in the company s discounted cash flow analysis would not have indicated impairment for any of the company s reporting units 
long term incentive compensation equity incentive plans as of march   the company has grants of incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  time based restricted stock and performance based restricted stock outstanding 
estimates are required to determine the number of share based awards which will ultimately vest  and  in the case of performance based restricted stock  estimates of the company s future performance 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate  differences between actual and estimated forfeitures when an award vests or changes in estimates regarding the company s performance can have material effects on share based compensation expense 
for this reason  management has determined that the estimates used to determine equity based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates 
when estimating forfeitures  the company considers termination behaviors as well as trends of actual equity based awards forfeited 
management re assesses the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the required service period 
such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures 
as required  forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests 
actual forfeitures in the future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than management s current estimates  which could have a material impact on equity based compensation expense recognized in future years 
when estimating the company s earnings per share goals for performance based restricted stock  the company reviews historical performance  internal plans and goals  economic conditions  and other performance metrics 
these future performance estimates are re assessed throughout the service period 
such estimates are revised  if necessary  if they differ materially from the original assessment and may have an impact on the vesting of an award 
if actual performance differs significantly from management s current estimates  it could have a material impact on equity based compensation expense recognized in fiscal year and in future years 
specifically  a change in the company s future earnings per share performance estimate  which would meet certain milestones  would have a material impact on equity based compensation expense 
total compensation expense for restricted stock grants during the fiscal years ended march   march   and march   was million  million  and million  respectively 
current forfeiture rates average per quarter  with actual rates ranging from to per quarter for fiscal years if management had used the low and high end of these actual ranges during fiscal year  equity based compensation expense  included in general and administrative expenses  would have been million and million  respectively 
holding forfeiture rates static  if management had estimated the company s future performance at the minimum and maximum earnings per share ranges  equity based compensation expense would have been million and million  respectively  during the fiscal year ended march  refer to footnote  shareholders equity  for additional information

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company s objective in managing market risk exposures is to identify and limit the potential impact of changes in interest rates  commodity availability  and access of capital on earnings and cash flow 
the following assessment of the company s market risk does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political uncertainty  economic uncertainty  impact of future tax legislation  and credit risks 
interest rate risk 
the company s primary interest rate exposure relates to cash and cash equivalents and fixed and variable rate debt 
during fiscal year  the company s debt obligations consisted of i million senior convertible notes with a fixed rate of  ii million senior convertible notes with a fixed rate of  and iii variable rate borrowings under the revolving line of credit  which bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin based on a fixed charge coverage ratio  or at libor plus an applicable margin based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
fixed charge coverage is determined by the ratio of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization to the sum of fixed charges  including but not limited to  interest expense  capital expenditures  payment of debt principal  and cash paid for taxes 
changes in interest rates affect interest payments under the company s variable rate revolving line of credit agreement 
the company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variable interest rate of its revolving line of credit 
during fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million swap 
under the terms of the swap  the company makes payments based on the fixed rate and will receive interest payments based on month libor which effectively fixes the notional amount covered by the swap at a borrowing rate of plus a credit spread 
the changes in market value of these financial instruments are highly correlated with changes in market value of the hedged item both at inception and over the life of the agreement 
amounts received or paid under the interest rate swap agreement are recorded as reductions or additions to interest expense

 the company s interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge with changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of march   the swap carries a notional principal amount of million and effectively fixes the interest rate on a portion of the revolving line of credit to  prior to applying the applicable margin discussed above 
the swap agreement expires on february  and settles monthly until expiration 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march   the company recorded unrealized losses  net of tax  of approximately million and million  respectively  for the estimated fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts 
during fiscal year  the company had average daily variable rate borrowings under its line of credit of million 
excluding the impact of the interest rate swap  a hypothetical increase decrease in prevailing interest rates at march   would result in a corresponding increase decrease in interest expense of approximately million

currency risk 
the company s currency rate exposures relate to products that are globally sourced from manufacturers primarily in southeast asia 
currently  the company has negotiated settlement of payments to manufacturers in us dollars 
however  over time  local country currency fluctuations may increase or decrease the negotiated cost that the company must pay for these products 
in addition  the company may in future periods negotiate settlement of payments to manufacturers in the local currency of the country providing a product which would then subject the company to foreign currency risk 
commodity risk 
the company s primary commodity exposures relate to fluctuations in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel and the procurement of certain medical supplies in which the product cost is dependent upon the price of raw materials 
the company s direct fuel exposure relates to fluctuations in fuel costs that affect the company leased delivery fleet or third party delivery charges 
significant increases in the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel have impacted  and may continue to impact  the company s gross margin  cost to deliver  and the operating costs of third part transportation providers 
some of these common carriers have passed these increases through to the company in the form of a fuel surcharge  which has had an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company implemented a fuel surcharge to its customers during fiscal year to pass on a portion of the increased cost of gasoline and diesel fuel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully pass along further significant increases in fuel costs to its customers due to the competitive nature of the medical supply distribution industry 
as of march  march  and march  the us national average for unleaded gasoline ranged from  and gallon  respectively  and the us national average for diesel fuel ranged from   and gallon  respectively 
with respect to the company s direct fuel purchases  a hypothetical increase decrease in diesel and unleaded fuel costs during fiscal years and would have resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in fuel expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company purchases latex and vinyl gloves through agreements in which the pricing of the gloves is based on the price of latex as traded on the malaysian rubber exchange and the weighted price of two raw materials  poly vinyl chloride pvc and dioctylphthalate dop  as published on www 
icis 
com 
latex  pvc  and dop in their raw form are only one of many components used on the manufacture of gloves 
however  based on estimates of component mix  a hypothetical increase decrease in latex costs during fiscal years and would have resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in the cost of latex gloves of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  a hypothetical increase decrease in pvc and dop costs during fiscal years and would have resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in the cost of vinyl gloves of approximately million and million respectively
