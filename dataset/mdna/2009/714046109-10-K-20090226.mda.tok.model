the lease obligations continue through march while we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business  in the event the buyer defaults under the lease  we are responsible for all remaining lease payments and certain other building related expenses 
as an additional measure to facilitate the sale of the business  we obtained a letter of credit as partial security for a loan to the buyer  which could have been drawn upon by the buyer s lender in the event the buyer was delinquent in repayment of the loan 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the lessor of the building began the process to evict the buyer as a result of unpaid lease payments and building expenses and sought reimbursement from us

in process research and development charge compared to we did not have an in process research and development ipr d charge in fiscal year the ipr d charge for fiscal year was million  which related to the acquisitions of evotec technologies gmbh and euroscreen products sa in january in determining the value of the in process projects  we considered  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the ipr d  using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset  including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an 
table of contents in process project over its useful life  and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined  represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date  and the amount represents management s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
compared to we did not have an ipr d charge in fiscal year interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net consisted of the following in thousands interest income interest expense discontinuance and settlement of cash flow hedge gains on disposition of investments  net other expense  net total interest and other expense  net compared to interest and other expense  net for fiscal year was million  as compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million

allocation of the purchase price for the acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired  and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
we record the excess purchase price over those assigned values as goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
purchased intangibles with finite lives will be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional details 
ipr d charges represent incomplete acquired research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
on the date of the acquisitions of evotec and euroscreen  there were multiple ipr d efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines 
in 
table of contents determining the value of in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
for these acquisitions  we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the ipr d  using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset  including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life  and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
for the acquisitions of evotec and euroscreen  we estimated the value of the ipr d to be million and million  respectively 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined  represent the fair value at the date of the acquisitions  and the amount represents management s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the projects 
the fair value of acquired ipr d costs was expensed as of the acquisition date as the projects underway at evotec and euroscreen had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no alternative future use 
in connection with the purchase price and related allocations for acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition  and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after consummation 
the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation  plus a normal profit margin thereon 
the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts  research and development  or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
in most acquisitions  profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating income approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation 
as a result of purchase accounting  we recognized the deferred revenue related to the viacell acquisition at fair value  and did not recognize million of deferred revenue that would have been otherwise recognized in future periods 
as of december   all purchase price and related allocations are final with the exception of the arnel acquisition which was preliminary as of december  the arnel purchase price and related allocations may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase price  as well as additional information regarding assets and liabilities assumed  including contingent liabilities  deferred taxes  and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of purchase 
we are not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the preliminary estimates  and we expect to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one year from the date of acquisition 
contingencies  including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of december   which represents our management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the time period over which remediation may occur  and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a prp  our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant 
table of contents named parties to contribute 
we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred  the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 
enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc 
collectively  enzo filed a complaint dated october  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  civil action no 
 against amersham plc  amersham biosciences  perkinelmer  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  sigma aldrich corporation  sigma chemical company  inc  molecular probes  inc  and orchid biosciences  inc the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo  infringed enzo s patents  engaged in unfair competition and fraud  and committed torts against enzo by  among other things  engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo s patented products and technology  separately and together with the other defendants 
enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief 
in  the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants 
we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo s patents are invalid 
in july  the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and  we believe  excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo s patents 
summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january  and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july  but a decision on those motions has not been rendered  and a trial date has not been set 
pharmastem therapeutics  inc pharmastem filed a complaint dated february  against viacell  inc  which is now our wholly owned subsidiary  and several other defendants in the united states district court for the district of delaware  alleging infringement of united states patents no 
 and no 
 relating to certain aspects of the collection  cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood pharmastem i 
after several years of proceedings at the district court level  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision in july that viacell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid 
pharmastem filed a certiorari petition in january seeking to have the united states supreme court review the appellate court s decision as to the invalidity of the patents  but did not seek any further review of the non infringement decision 
however  the united states supreme court denied certiorari in march  so the decision by the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit in favor of viacell is final and non appealable 
pharmastem had also filed a second complaint against viacell and other defendants in july in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  alleging infringement of united states patents no 
 and  which also relate to certain aspects of the collection  cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood pharmastem ii 
the delaware court granted viacell s motion in october to stay the proceedings in pharmastem ii pending the outcome of pharmastem i and a decision from the united states patent and trademark office us pto on certain patent re examination issues 
on september   the us pto issued a re examination certificate cancelling all claims of united states patent no 
 and on september   the us pto issued a re examination certificate cancelling all claims of united states patent no 
 as a result of the cancellation of all patent claims involved in pharmastem ii by the us pto  we will seek a dismissal of all claims for relief set forth by pharmastem in pharmastem ii 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings  and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters 
while each of these matters is subject to uncertainty  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents during fiscal year  the us internal revenue service concluded its audit of our federal income taxes for the years through there was a single open issue related to this audit which we favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition  tax years ranging from through remain open to examination by various state and foreign tax jurisdictions such as china  indonesia  the philippines and the united kingdom in which we have significant business operations 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide  including in canada  the netherlands  the united kingdom and the united states covering various years ranging from through we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
 which we adopted as of january  adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
we are also subject to various other claims  legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at december  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
each of these matters is subject to uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

as collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable  new receivables are sold 
our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables 
accordingly  the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheets 
the amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed million

we paid million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year towards decommissioning the building  and we anticipate that the remaining payments of million will be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year our businesses have not been materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general 
however  recent distress in these markets has adversely impacted a number of financial conditions by severely diminishing liquidity and credit availability  creating extreme volatility in security prices  increasing interest rates and or widening credit spreads  and decreasing valuations of certain investments 
the increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold 
increases in interest rates or credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit  could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

table of contents our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets  however  as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets  our pension funds had a negative return for fiscal year  which in turn created increased pension costs in fiscal year and potentially in additional future periods 
in addition  we may be required to fund our pension plans for approximately million by fiscal year  and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods 
we cannot predict how long these conditions will exist or how our businesses may be affected 
in difficult global financial markets  we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost  or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities

application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period  or as we render services and the customer accepts them 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element  all in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 

table of contents warranty costs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale 
warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand  or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements  or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
business combinations 
the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
the impairment test consists of a two step process 
the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january or the first day of each fiscal year 
this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered 
non amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the 
table of contents same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
through fiscal year  we assessed the annual impairment testing using the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics reporting units 
we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of december  and january   and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits 
retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business  and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future  and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement plans 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied  to determine service cost and interest cost  in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of december   we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was and was for all plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets  as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions  and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be  based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our pension plan expenses would also change 
a one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by million for fiscal year in the united states and by million for fiscal year for all plans outside the united states 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by million for fiscal year in the united states and by million for fiscal year for all plans outside the united states 
we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability  therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 
restructuring activities 
our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
our pre tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance  or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line entitled restructuring and lease charges reversals  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this 
table of contents estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets  and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the fiscal year ended december   we did not recognize any gains or losses from disposition of fixed assets 
we recorded million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings  and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions  and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by fin no 
adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  other income tax credits and certain pension accruals 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity  and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major 
table of contents banking institutions 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 
principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp  canadian dollar cad  euro eur  japanese yen jpy  and singapore dollar sgd 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at december  and million as of december   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material 
the duration of these contracts entered into in fiscal year was generally days 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and a weighted average interest rate of 
these contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million  upon the issuance of our senior unsecured notes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance  with a notional amount totaling million  was no longer probable 
as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable  we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and recognized derivative losses of million  in interest and other expense 
before amortization expense  we had accumulated derivative losses of million  net of taxes of million  in other comprehensive loss income as of december  and million  net of taxes of million  as of december   related to these cash flow hedges 
the derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
during fiscal year  million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense 
once established  cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive loss income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur 
discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties  and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements 
we did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year or fiscal year we do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
moreover  we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states  material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states  resulting in a natural hedge 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 

table of contents foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure 
we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of december   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year  the value at risk ranged between million and million  with an average of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and our earnings 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and a weighted average interest rate of 
these contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance 
in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million  upon the issuance of our senior unsecured notes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance  with a notional amount totaling million  was no longer probable 
as a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable  we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million and recognized derivative losses of million  in interest and other expense 
before amortization expense  we had accumulated derivative losses of million  net of taxes of million  in other comprehensive loss income as of december  and million  net of taxes of million  as of december   related to these cash flow hedges 
the derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
during fiscal year  million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense 
once established  cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive loss income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur 
discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties  and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements 
we did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year or fiscal year interest rate risk sensitivity 
as of december   our debt portfolio consisted of million of variable rate debt 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at december  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt  consisting of million of revolving and interim debt facilities  to fluctuate 
an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate
