overview netscout designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and supports a family of integrated management products that enable unified service delivery management capabilities  performance management and optimization of complex  high speed networks  that assure the delivery of critical business applications  services and content efficiently to customers and end users 
these solutions enable the world s largest it organizations to optimize  protect and simplify their it infrastructure and operational environments while bringing enhanced operational efficiencies and helping to reduce the total overall cost of it operations 
we manufacture and market these products in integrated hardware and software solutions that have been used by commercial enterprises  large governmental agencies and telecommunication service providers worldwide 
we have a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  we began to develop  manufacture and market our first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations and through the sale of netscout securities in conjunction with our initial public offering in august on november   we completed the acquisition of network general and embarked upon an extensive integration program to combine our respective organizations  operations and customer bases  and to merge our largely complementary products and technologies into a unified service assurance platform 
netscout publicly announced the integration of product technology from network general into a unified product in october  resulting in a powerful  unified solution that advances service assurance and performance management by combining extensive early warning capabilities  real time and historical application flow analysis  and deep packet forensics 
the acquisition of network general was valued at million for purchase accounting purposes 
the acquisition was financed with a combination of six million shares of our common stock  million of senior secured floating rate notes  and million in cash 
included in the million is million in transaction costs 
the integration of our back office systems was completed at april  the integration of the sales forces took place in the fiscal first quarter of and the product line and technology integration occurred throughout fiscal year 
table of contents in the comparative financial results  a full twelve months of the network general business is included in the consolidated results for the fiscal year ended march  compared to only five months for the prior year and none in fiscal year this differential has a significant impact on understanding the financial statements and related year over year explanations 
our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix of products and services sold  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations 
factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include  but are not limited to  our ability to introduce and enhance existing products  the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products  continued expansion into international markets  development of strategic partnerships  competition  successful integration efforts and current economic conditions 
in fiscal year  our total revenue increased million  or  to million compared to million in fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of network general on november  our cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million compared to million in fiscal year this increase is primarily due to the increased revenue associated with the acquisition of network general 
gross profit of million  or of revenue  in fiscal year increased from million  or of revenue  in fiscal year this increase in gross margin percentage is attributable to product mix and synergies with the combined businesses 
our gross margin is primarily affected by the mix and volume of our product and service revenue 
product revenue in fiscal year increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year service revenue in fiscal year increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year we realize significantly higher gross margins on service revenue than on product revenue 
our operating expenses  which include research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal year by million  or  to million  compared to million in fiscal year the primary contributor to this increase in operating expenses was higher employee related expenses due to increased headcount as a result of the network general acquisition in november as well as higher sales and marketing expenses including sales commissions commensurate with the higher sales volume 
net income for fiscal year increased by million  to net income of million compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the contribution of the acquired network general business and growth in the netscout business  as well as non recurring integration costs in the prior year  partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense associated with debt entered into as a result of the acquisition of network general 
we have continued to see significant benefit from operating leverage and remain focused on increasing our operating margin by growing revenue while containing expenses 
for fiscal year  our income from operations was million  increasing by million compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal year we continue to see increased interest from our customers in the importance of managing and assuring the delivery of services from within the network with packet flow technology through a unified service delivery management platform 
as networks continue to expand  bandwidth continues to increase  applications become more complex  converged networks become more prevalent  and virtualization  web services and service oriented architectures become more pervasive  our products are ideally positioned to enable it organizations to optimize  protect and simplify their modern ip network and the services delivered to their users 
during fiscal year  we released several new products and enhancements that will help our it organizations meet the challenges of managing service delivery and application and network performance issues across large  globally distributed enterprise  service provider  and government networks we introduced ngenius k  the industry s first packet flow based intelligent early warning service performance management dashboard that enables it organizations to predict and prevent service 
table of contents delivery problems 
ngenius k is a fully integrated add on module to the widely deployed ngenius performance management solution 
ngenius k delivers integrated service management capabilities through innovative kpis that provide powerful  at a glance visualization and correlation of network and application health and users experiences 
the introduction of ngenius k not only addresses it organization needs for always on visibility  it also extends the addressable target of our products to include network  datacenter and application managers to help them monitor the status of all related service delivery elements  we launched sniffer global  the industry s first enterprise class portable network analyzer solution that brings much needed security  control  user activity reporting and enhanced manageability capabilities 
sniffer global addresses a widely overlooked security risk by integrating the portable protocol analyzer into a policy based  secure operating environment that is governed and controlled from a central authentication server 
sniffer global controls what network data a portable analyzer user has access to  and how deeply they can access and analyze network traffic or data  helping to protect and mitigate risks from potential unauthorized use or activities  we announced two new key releases within the sniffer intelligence line of advanced  service aware expert troubleshooting solutions 
sniffer financial intelligence provides intelligent analysis enabling optimizations for capital markets and financial trading environments 
sniffer mobile intelligence provides intelligent analysis capabilities specifically for g mobile networks targeting mobile service providers  we released significant upgrades for both ngenius performance manager and ngenius infinistream products that significantly enhanced the functionality and value of our products and delivered on our promise to deliver a single unified hardware and software solution that leverages and integrates the underlying technology from netscout and network general 
our integration of sniffer portfolio into the ngenius portfolio enables our customers to efficiently leverage their existing investments and benefit from the combined technical capabilities of two market leading platforms 
as a result of the product unification  elements from both product lines have come together under the ngenius performance management umbrella 
netscout has also unified its family of continuous capture dpc devices  formerly known as ngenius afmon and sniffer infinistream  as ngenius infinistream 
the new ngenius infinistream dpc devices retain important elements from both product lines delivering operational consistency with a flexible range of interface options and storage capacities to meet our customers most demanding high performance requirements  in december  we announced the mnoc mobility extension for our ngenius k product 
mnoc mobility extends the physical boundaries of the traditional noc  by enabling delivery of real time performance and service delivery management metrics to web based mobile devices enabling it staff and business managers to have anyplace  anytime visibility into the health of their network  applications and service delivery environment 
this enhancement enables mobile it staff access to a wide range of comprehensive performance intelligence  predictive early warning alerts and definitive problem identification in rich graphic detail providing a collaborative environment with consistent workflows from which to manage the service delivery environment 
backed by orders coming from the government and wireless telecommunications markets  we are entering fiscal year with combined product backlog  consisting of unshipped orders  and deferred product revenue of million 
we believe that this product backlog is firm and both our unshipped orders and deferred product revenue to be material to an understanding of our financial results 
however  due to the fact that most of our customers have the contractual ability to cancel unshipped orders prior to shipment we cannot provide assurance that our product backlog at any point in time will ultimately become revenue 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies related to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  assumptions related to purchase accounting  valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets  capitalization of software development costs  share based compensation  and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
the application of these policies involves significant judgments and estimates by us 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities we account for our investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or sfas under the provisions of sfas  we have classified our investments as available for sale which are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices and associated unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments  us treasury bills  auction rate securities and municipal bonds 
cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
long term marketable securities  which consist of auction rate securities  typically were stated at par value prior to february due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  par value no longer approximates the estimated fair value of auction rate securities 
a discounted cash flow model was used to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities as of march  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the investments 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of march  we have recorded a cumulative decline in the fair value of auction rate securities of million  which was deemed temporary 
assumptions used require significant judgments by management 
changes in the assumptions could result in materially different estimates of fair values  resulting in additional credits and charges presented in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
because we have determined that the software components of our products are essential to the functionality and value of these products  we recognize our revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position software revenue recognition 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide software and hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software warranty expiration  typically for month periods 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the work is performed 
multi element arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the purchase is analyzed and a portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements 
under the residual method  the remaining portion of the total purchase price is allocated to the 
table of contents delivered elements  generally hardware and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
we review the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a semi annual basis and update  when appropriate  our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
uncollected deferred revenue because of our revenue recognition policies  there are circumstances for which we are unable to recognize revenue relating to sales transactions that have been billed  but the related account receivable has not been collected 
while the receivable represents an enforceable obligation  for balance sheet presentation purposes we have not recognized the deferred revenue or the related account receivable and no amounts appear in our consolidated balance sheets for such transactions 
the aggregate amount of unrecognized accounts receivable and deferred revenue was million and million at march  and  respectively 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or their net realizable value 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out  or fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory carrying values are reduced to our estimate of net realizable value 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our net realizable value adjustment is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
we adjust the cost basis of inventory that has been written down to reflect its net realizable value 
as of march  and  net realizable value adjustments included within inventory on the balance sheet totaled thousand and thousand  respectively 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the net realizable value adjustment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and the valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships and developed product technology  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for planned integration liabilities as well as litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by netscout professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  research and development  sales and executive management 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could result in material impacts to earnings 
the carrying value of goodwill was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of our enterprise exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in income equal to that excess 
during the year ended march   a decrease of million was made to 
table of contents adjust tax attributes and deferred tax assets related to the network general acquisition including the release of the valuation allowance established on state tax attributes as part of the network general acquisition 
we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as one indicator that may potentially trigger an impairment of goodwill analysis 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and an asset is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
as of march   based upon our review  we determined that there has been no goodwill impairment 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets is recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
our acquired intangible assets include developed product technology  customer relationships and an indefinite lived tradename resulting from the acquisition of network general on november  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis  except for the acquired tradename which has an indefinite life and thus  is not amortized 
the carrying value of the indefinite lived tradename is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis 
at march  we determined that there had been no impairment of acquired intangible assets  or indefinite lived assets 
significant judgment and estimates are made when estimating fair value and useful lives for acquired intangible assets 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  the value of these assets and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred  except for certain software development costs 
costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  or sfas and capitalized thereafter  until the related software products are available for first customer shipment 
judgment is required in determining the point at which technological feasibility has been met 
amortization of capitalized software development costs are charged to cost of revenue on a straight line basis over two years 
we also capitalize acquired software in accordance with sfas share based compensation effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after april  and those shares granted in prior periods but not yet vested as of april   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas r s adoption  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  compensation expense was recognized only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price  granted restricted stock units  or granted options to non employees 

table of contents based on historical experience  we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our directors during fiscal years   and  and an annualized forfeiture rate of   and for awards granted to our senior executives and remaining employees during fiscal years   and we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change resulted in pre tax income of thousand and was recognized in the statement of operations for the year ended march  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes significant judgments and estimates are made when calculating our annual provision for income taxes 
in addition  we may record certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our tax positions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our tax rate could fluctuate significantly and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of these assets and liabilities as well as on acquired or incurred net operating loss carryforward amounts 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider past performance  future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as of march   deferred income tax assets were million  consisting primarily of million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  million of federal and state tax credits and million other temporary book and tax accounting differences 
significant accounting judgments and estimates are made when determining whether it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will be realized and  accordingly  do not require a valuation allowance 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  a valuation allowance may be required and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize some or all of the deferred income taxes in the future  an adjustment to the deferred income tax assets will be credited to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
a valuation allowance has been established for certain federal foreign tax credits related to the network general acquisition  which we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas  accounting for income taxes 
if it is later determined that we are able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance 
an adjustment to these deferred tax assets will be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

table of contents we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
as used in fin  the term more likely than not means that the likelihood of an occurrence is greater than 
we adopted fin as of april  as required

the  or million  increase in product revenue was primarily due to the network general acquisition 
product revenue as a percent of total revenue decreased five points when compared to fiscal year the acquisition of network general has shifted the revenue mix as network general had a larger service component to its business 
service 
the  or million  increase in service revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our customer base due to the acquisition of network general and an increase in the number of customer support agreements attributable to new product sales generated during the last months  combined with continued renewals of customer support agreements from our expanding installed product base 
total product and service revenue from direct and indirect channels are as follows fiscal year ended march  change dollars in thousands of revenue of revenue indirect direct total revenue the  or million  increase in indirect channel revenue is primarily the result of additional revenue generated as a result of the network general acquisition as well as increased sales to the federal sector  which we sell to entirely through channel partners  and increased international sales which are almost exclusively sold through channel partners 
sales to customers outside the united states are primarily export sales through indirect channel partners  who are generally responsible for distributing our products and providing technical support and service to customers within their territories 
sales arrangements are primarily transacted in united states dollars 
our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside the united states that are shipped to our united states based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers fulfill customer orders based upon joint selling efforts in conjunction with our direct sales force and may subsequently ship our products to international locations  however  we report these shipments as united states revenue since we ship the products to a domestic location 
the  or million  increase in direct channel revenue is primarily the result of additional revenue generated as a result of the network general acquisition and a significant increase in fiscal in revenue from the united states where direct selling is more prevalent

this increase is due to a broad increase in international business but most notable in other americas where we had a increase in revenue 
we expect revenue from sales to customers outside the united states to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
revenue from sales to customers in the united states increased by  or million  primarily as the result of the network general acquisition

table of contents product 
the  or million  increase in cost of product revenue was primarily due to the increase in product revenue during the year ended march  a majority of the increase in revenue was associated with the acquisition of network general 
the product gross margin percentage increased by four points from to for the years ended march  and  respectively  due to product mix and realized cost synergies mainly from reduced material costs resulting from the network general acquisition 
average headcount in cost of product was and for the years ended march  and  respectively service 
the  or million  increase in cost of service revenue was primarily due to the million increase in personnel costs associated with our customer support and training groups as a result of the network general acquisition and million of increased allocated overhead costs such as higher internal it spending 
the  or million  increase in service gross profit corresponds with the  or million  increase in service revenue  offset by the  or million  increase in cost of service revenue 
the service gross margin percentage increased by four points from to for the year ended march  and  respectively  due to a decline in purchase accounting valuation adjustments year over year as well as cost synergies resulting from the network general acquisition 
the acquisition of the network general business has also shifted the revenue mix with service revenue accounting for a greater percentage of total revenue 
average headcount in cost of service was and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased  or million 
this increase was consistent with our revenue growth of  or million 
the net effect of the combined increases in revenue and cost of revenue was a four point increase in gross profit percentage from to for the years ended march  and  respectively 
this increase in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to favorable product mix  a shift in revenue mix towards our higher margin service business and realized cost synergies in fiscal year as a result of the network general integration

amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of customer relationships related to the acquisition of network general 
the million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets was due to amortization of the customer relationships and net beneficial leases acquired in the acquisition of network general in november  offset by a thousand decrease in quantiva  inc  or quantiva  non compete agreement amortization expense which became fully amortized during the first quarter of fiscal year interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted investments and interest expense

amounts outstanding under the facility bear interest at a floating interest rate dependent upon  at our election  libor or keybank s prime rate  in each case plus a margin  and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
under the agreement  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants which require that we maintain minimum amounts of liquidity  the most restrictive of which is a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to and a maximum leverage ratio of less than to 
as of march   we were in compliance with such covenants 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities increased by million from march  to march  while cash and cash equivalents increased by million  short and long term marketable securities increased in total by million 
our long term marketable securities include investments in auction rate securities valued at million at march   including accrued interest 
auction rate securities are publicly issued securities with long term maturities for which interest rates reset through a dutch auction in short term intervals  in the case of our securities every days 
this mechanism was structured to allow existing investors to roll over their holdings and continue to own their respective securities or liquidate their holdings by selling at par value through the auction process 
the company invested in these securities as part of its cash management program 
historically  this auction process provided liquidity and supported a short term classification of these securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
beginning in february and continuing through the date of this report  uncertainties in the credit markets resulted in failed auctions and a lack of short term liquidity for these securities  which has caused us to classify our auction rate securities within long term marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of march  our auction rate securities consisted of six positions issued by municipal agencies with a total par value of million and a current estimated market value totaling million 
during the quarter ended december   a partial call transaction was closed related to one of our auction rate securities positions 
as a result of the call we received proceeds of thousand  which represented a recovery of the full par value of a portion of this particular security 
the auction rate securities held by netscout at march  have maturity dates ranging from december through december these investments range from aaa to a rated and are collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal government through the federal family education loan program  or ffelp  and by monoline insurance companies 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery in the auction process or other liquidity event occurs 
the fair value of these securities has been estimated by management based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in a current transaction in accordance with sfas fair value measurements and fsp determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active as further disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment  and we may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market and economic conditions  including changes in market rates  the estimated timing until a liquidity event  or the discount factor associated with illiquidity and the credit ratings of our securities 
there is no assurance as to when liquidity will return to this investment class  and therefore  we continue to monitor and evaluate these securities 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the lack of liquidity in these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan

capital expenditures for internal use software of thousand and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  represent costs of procurement and development of a new erp system that was implemented in august capital expenditures for fixed assets of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  represent an investment in our infrastructure as we prepare for future growth 
we anticipate that our investment in our infrastructure will continue in future quarters 
net cash used in provided by financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary outflow was due to the repayment of million of our long term debt with keybank  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the amount of million and a tax benefit from stock options exercised of thousand 
net cash provided by financing activities was thousand during the fiscal year ended march  the primary source was mainly due to proceeds received from the incurrence of long term debt with keybank in connection with the re financing of our senior secured floating rate notes  due in  totaling million net of deferred financing costs  offset by the repayments of long term debt totaling million which represents repayment of senior secured floating rate notes and the first principal payment on our long term debt with keybank 
cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended march  also included the exercise of stock options in the amount of million 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million during the fiscal year ended march  the primary source was the exercise of stock options in the amount of million  offset by the purchase of treasury stock of million  in connection with our open market stock repurchase program 
on september   netscout announced an open market stock repurchase program that enables netscout to purchase up to one million shares of its outstanding common stock  subject to market conditions and other factors 
on july   the company announced that it had expanded the existing open market repurchase program to enable the company to purchase an additional three million shares of the company s outstanding common stock  bringing the total number of shares authorized for repurchase to million shares 
through the fiscal year ended march   netscout has repurchased  shares of its common stock into treasury stock through its open market stock repurchase program 
cash to be used under this program in the future is undeterminable at this point in time 
liquidity we believe that our cash balances  short term marketable securities classified as available for sale and future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt for at least the next months 
if demand for our product were to decrease substantially  our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs could be materially impacted 
additionally  a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies such as our recent acquisition of network general 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of illiquidity of auction rate securities  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
credit risk 
our cash equivalents and short term marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments  us treasury bills and municipal obligations 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our long term marketable securities  which consist primarily of auction rate securities  are stated at fair value based on risk adjusted discounted cash flow calculations 
prior to february  these securities typically were stated at par value 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  par value no longer approximates the estimated 
table of contents fair value of auction rate securities 
as a result of their illiquidity  we have recorded a temporary impairment at march  against the carrying value of our auction rate securities 
additional information regarding auction rate securities is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements held by netscout at march  at march  and periodically throughout the year  we have maintained cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits 
we limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution by evaluating the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we invest 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates related to our term loan with keybank 
as of march   we owed million on this loan with a weighted average interest rate of 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outstanding portion of our debt obligation as of march  should the current weighted average interest rate increase or decrease by  the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense would be approximately thousand 
foreign currency exchange risk 
netscout s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations historically has been limited 
prior to the acquisition of network general  all of our revenue transactions were executed in us dollars 
currently  the substantial majority of our revenue transactions are executed in us dollars 
netscout pays for certain foreign operating expenses such as payroll  rent and office expense in local currency  and  therefore  currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
currently  netscout does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency denominated account balances and transactions is recorded in the period incurred
