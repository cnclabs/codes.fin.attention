item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances for inventory and receivables  estimated fair value of stock based compensation  warranty reserves  impairment of long lived and intangible assets  realizability of deferred tax assets and estimating potential liabilities relating to ongoing litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the sec suggests that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the critical accounting policies presented below as those accounting policies that affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s audit committee has reviewed and approved the critical accounting policies identified 
alanco technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company is reporting consolidated revenues for fiscal years ended june  and from its rfid technology segment and wireless asset management segment 
the data storage segment  reported as an operating segment in prior years  is reported as discontinued operations for fiscal years and the following table is a summary of the results of operations and other financial information by major segment wireless asset rfid management technology corporate total fiscal year sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general administrative stock based compensation expense operating income loss gross margin accounts receivable  net inventory  net total assets capital expenditures research development depreciation amortization fiscal year sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general administrative stock based compensation expense operating loss gross margin accounts receivable  net inventory  net total assets capital expenditures research development depreciation amortization the company believes that data storage accounts receivable will not be included in the sale of assets held for sale and accordingly has included that segments accounts receivable balance in corporate accounts receivables at both june  and alanco technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries sales consolidated net sales for fiscal year were  a increase when compared to  reported for fiscal year the increase in sales resulted from increases for both the rfid technology segment and the wireless asset management segments 
the company s wireless asset management segment reported a sales increase of  or  to  compared to prior year sales of  the sales increase resulted from increased product demand in the refrigerated truck trailer market 
although revenues on a quarter to quarter comparison may fluctuate  management believes that increases in hardware sales and monitoring revenues will continue to increase in fiscal year ended through new product introductions and increased market penetration 
sales for the rfid technology segment increased by  or  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in the rfid technology segment sales reflects momentum in customer acceptance of the tsi prsim tracking and monitoring technology and reflects the completion of the long sales cycles required for customers to understand the advantages of the tsi prism technology and then secure budget approval for an acquisition this sales improvement has been achieved while maintaining the pricing structure it has utilized over the past few years 
the sales process for the tsi prism products is protracted because it generally involves four separate phases product presentation to a state director of corrections  obtaining the state director of correction s agreement to position the product among the top priorities of his budget  competing with other state projects for funding and publishing the rfp request for proposal and awarding the contract 
rfid segment customers are currently at various phases in the procurement process  and we believe that although tsi prism revenues may fluctuate on a quarter to quarter comparison basis  management believes that sales will continue to increase in fiscal year as the funding phase is completed and contracts are awarded 
as further evidence of improved market penetration by the tsi prism technology  the company announced during the year that tsi prism had been selected as subcontractor for tracking and monitoring technology required for nineteen federal immigration detention facilities under a three year  million contract awarded to northrop grumman corporation northrop 
the department of homeland security awarded northrop a task order to provide infrastructure and an integrated system that will locate and track detainees  reserve bed space among various facilities and manage detainee transportation requirements

gross profit the company reported gross profit for fiscal year of  of sales  an increase of  or  when compared to  of sales for the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin resulted from improved gross profit in both the rfid technology segment and the wireless asset management segment 
fiscal year gross profits for the wireless asset management segment increased to  of sales  an increase of  or compared to  of sales in gross profit reported for fiscal year ended june  the increase in gross profit resulted from additional hardware sales and data services revenue compared to the prior year 
the margins in fiscal continued to be negatively effected by additional costs estimated at approximately  required to convert current customers from control channel to gsm products  and special inventory obsolescence reserve adjustments of approximately  recorded due to the changeover to the new rt product line 
the rfid technology segment reported gross profit of  of sales  a increase compared to the  of sales reported for the prior fiscal year 
the increase resulted primarily from increased sales as discussed above 
in addition  gross margin for the rfid technology segment in fiscal year was negatively affected by a strategic decision to install a system at a low margin that provided a significant opportunity to test certain design concepts with an objective of developing a lower cost rfid system designed for a new market and not due to other changes in pricing strategy 
we believe that reported gross margin for fiscal years is more reflective of expected gross margin under higher sales levels

fiscal year interest expense  net of interest income  was  compared to net interest expense of  for the previous year 
the increase was due primarily to a one time accelerated amortization of deferred loan costs of approximately  related to the prepayment on the comvest term loan as partially offset by an interest rate reduction related to decreases in the prime rate 
the company reported other expense of  for the year ended june   compared to other income of  reported for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year 
other income for fiscal related to the final liquidation of fry guy assets 
the current fiscal year other expense was due primarily to a  charge during the current fiscal year to reduce the estimated value of the company s investment in tsin 
the operations of atsi were acquired in may of by the issuance of million post october  reverse split shares of the company s class a common stock and the assumptions of certain specific liabilities 
in anticipation of the transaction  the company had acquired approximately of the then outstanding shares of tsin 
tsin had stated it was its intent to liquidate enough shares of the alanco stock to pay off all tsin liabilities and to distribute the remaining alanco shares to the tsin stockholders 
to reflect the investment in tsin subsequent to the acquisition  the company estimated that approximately million shares would be remaining after payment of all tsin liabilities and that an ownership would receive approximately  shares upon distribution 
therefore  the company recorded  treasury shares valued at market price on the transaction date 
on january   a shareholder of tsin filed suit naming as defendants the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  atsi 
the complaint set forth various allegations and sought damages arising out of the company s acquisition of substantially all of the assets of tsin 
eventually  the lawsuit was transferred to tsin who became the plaintiff and continued the legal process until september when the parties to the lawsuit entered into a settlement agreement more fully explained in note tsin litigation settlement of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
from through september  tsin incurred significant legal expenses associated with the lawsuit  forcing tsin to sell a significant portion of the alanco share held  thereby reducing the number of alanco shares available to tsin shareholders upon distribution 
to reflect that reduction in investment value of the company s ownership in tsin  the company  during fiscal year ended june   reduced the estimated number of treasury shares to be received upon distribution from  shares to  shares and recorded a charge to other expenses of  loss from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations represents the loss from the data storage segment which has been classified as an asset held for sale at june  and for the fiscal year ended june  the loss from discontinued operations was  an improvement of  when compared to a loss of  for fiscal year ebitda the company believes that loss earnings before net interest income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets ebitda  is an important measure used by management to measure performance

the wireless asset management segment reported an accounts receivable balance at june  of  or of the current fiscal year end consolidated balance  compared to of the consolidated balance at the prior fiscal year end 
the  june  balance for the wireless asset management segment represented forty days sales compared to an accounts receivable balance at june  of  representing fifty five days sales 
the decrease in days sales resulted from improved sales over the prior fiscal year as well as the segment s efforts to improve collections

the data storage segment accounts receivable balance at june  of  represented fourteen days sales in receivables compared to  or eight days  at fiscal year end days sales in receivables for the data storage segment may be significantly affected by the percentage of credit card sales in a particular period versus a comparable period and therefore a change in days sales in receivables is not considered a trend towards faster or slower receivable collection 
days sales for the rfid technology segment  forty nine days at june  is a significant improvement as compared to two hundred and three days at june  the change is primarily due to the increased sales volume in fiscal year as compared to  approximately m versus m respectively

considering the company s working capital position at year end and the projected cash requirements to fund operations  management estimates that the year end cash balance of  would have been adequate to meet cash requirements for approximately a three month period 
subsequent to year end  the company completed additional financings as explained in note subsequent events in the consolidated financial statements 
although management cannot assure that future operations will achieve projections  or that additional debt and or equity will not be required  we believe our cash balances at year end  operating projections  additional capital raised subsequent to june  and working capital that we plan on raising during the year  may provide adequate capital resources to maintain operations for the next year 
if additional working capital is required during fiscal and not obtained through additional long term debt  equity capital or operations  it could adversely affect future operations 
management has historically been successful in obtaining financing and has demonstrated the ability to implement a number of cost cutting initiatives to reduce working capital needs 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k have been prepared assuming the company will continue to operate and do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern
