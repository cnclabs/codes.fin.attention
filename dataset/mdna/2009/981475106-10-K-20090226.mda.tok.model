item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion may contain forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward looking statements 
some factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward looking statements are described in item a risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the marketing and sale of marine  aviation and land fuel products and related services on a worldwide basis 
we compete by providing our customers value added benefits  including single supplier convenience  competitive pricing  the availability of trade credit  price risk management  logistical support  fuel quality control and fuel procurement outsourcing 
we have three reportable operating business segments marine  aviation and land 
in our marine segment  we offer fuel and related services to a broad base of maritime customers  including international container and tanker fleets  commercial cruise lines and time charter operators  as well as to the united states and foreign governments 
in our aviation segment  we offer fuel and related services to major commercial airlines  second and third tier airlines  cargo carriers  regional and low cost carriers  corporate fleets  fractional operators  private aircraft  military fleets and to the united states and foreign governments  as well as a private label charge card used to purchase aviation fuel and related services to customers in the general aviation industry 
in our land segment  we offer fuel and related services to petroleum distributors operating in the land transportation market and retail petroleum operators and other end users 
through our acquisition of the texor business in june  we also offer branded and unbranded gasoline and diesel fuel to retail petroleum operators and industrial  commercial and government customers and operate a small number of retail gasoline stations 
our revenue and cost of revenue are significantly impacted by world oil prices  as evidenced in part by our revenue and cost of revenue increases year over year  while our gross profit is not necessarily impacted by the change in world oil prices 
however  our gross profit can be impacted by significant movements in fuel prices during any given financial period due to our inventory average costing methodology 
changes in fuel prices can positively or negatively impact gross profit during any given financial period depending on the direction  volatility and timing of such price movements 
in our marine segment  we primarily purchase and resell fuel  and act as brokers for others 
profit from our marine segment is determined primarily by the volume and gross profit achieved on fuel resales and by the volume and commission rate of the brokering business 
in our aviation and land segments  we primarily purchase and resell fuel  and we do not act as brokers 
profit from our aviation and land segments is primarily determined by the volume and the gross profit achieved on fuel resales  and in the case of the aviation segment  a percentage of processed credit card charges related to our avcard business 
our profitability in our segments also depends on our operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debt 
we may experience decreases in future sales volumes and margins as a result of the ongoing deterioration in the world economy  transportation industry  natural disasters and continued conflicts and instability in the middle east  asia and latin america  as well as potential future terrorist activities and possible military retaliation 
in addition  because fuel costs represent a significant part of our customers operating expenses  volatile and or high fuel prices can adversely affect our customers businesses  and consequently the demand for our services and our results of operations 
our hedging activities may not be effective to mitigate volatile fuel prices and may expose us to counterparty risk 
see item a risk factors of this form k 
reportable segments we evaluate and manage our three reportable business segments using the performance measurement of income from operations 
corporate overhead costs are allocated to the segments based on usage  where possible  or on other factors according to the nature of the activity 
financial information with respect to our business segments is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenue and related costs of sales  bad debt  share based payment awards  investments  derivatives  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of fuel is recognized when the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title passes to the customer  which is when the delivery of fuel is made to our customer directly from the supplier or a third party subcontractor 
our fuel sales are generated as a fuel reseller as well as from on hand inventory supply 
when acting as a fuel reseller  we contemporaneously purchase fuel from the supplier  mark it up  and resell the fuel to the customer  generally taking delivery for purchased fuel at the same place and time as the delivery is made 
we record the gross sale of the fuel as we generally take inventory risk  have latitude in establishing the sales price  have discretion in the supplier selection  maintain credit risk and are the primary obligor in the sales arrangement 
revenue from fuel related services is recognized when services are performed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record the sale of fuel related services on a gross basis as we generally have latitude in establishing the sales price  have discretion in supplier selection  maintain credit risk and are the primary obligor in the sales arrangement 
commission from fuel broker services is recognized when services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when acting as a fuel broker  we are paid a commission by the supplier 
revenue from charge card transactions is recognized at the time the purchase is made by the customer using the charge card 
revenue from charge card transactions is generated from processing fees 
share based payment awards we account for share based payment awards on a fair value basis 
under fair value accounting  the grant date fair value of the share based payment award is amortized as compensation expense  on a straight line basis  over the vesting period for both graded and cliff vesting awards 
annual compensation expense for share based payment awards is reduced by an expected forfeiture amount on the outstanding share based payment awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of option awards 
the estimation of the fair value of option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the expected term of option awards represents the estimated period of time from grant until exercise or conversion and is based on vesting schedules and expected post vesting  exercise and employment termination behavior 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
any adjustment to the historical volatility as an indicator of future volatility would be based on the impact to historical volatility of significant non recurring events that would not be expected in the future 
risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
dividend yields are based on the historical dividends of world fuel over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life  as adjusted for stock splits 
the estimated fair value of common stock  restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the grant date market value of our common stock  as defined in the respective plans under which the awards were issued 
accounts receivable and allowance for bad debt credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed for each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee 
the credit committees are responsible for approving credit limits  setting and maintaining credit standards  and managing the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon a customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to most of our customers 
accounts receivable are deemed past due based on contractual terms agreed with our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience with our customers  current market and industry conditions affecting our customers  and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
historical payment trends may not be a useful indicator of current or future credit worthiness of our customers  particularly in these unprecedented difficult economic and financial markets 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for estimated credit losses 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see item a risk factors of this form k 
inventories inventories are valued using the average cost methodology and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
components of inventory include fuel purchase costs  the related transportation costs and storage fees 
derivatives we enter into derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine  aviation and land fuel  and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
we also enter into derivatives in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have applied the normal purchase and normal sales exception npns  as provided by statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  to certain of our physical forward sales and purchase contracts 
while these contracts are considered derivative instruments under fas no 
 they are not recorded at fair value  but on an accrual basis of accounting  which means the values related to such contracts are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements until physical settlement of the contract occurs 
if it is determined that a transaction designated as npns no longer meets the scope exception  the fair value of the related contract is recorded as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet and the difference between the fair value and the contract amount is immediately recognized through earnings 
our derivatives that are subject to fas no 
are recognized at estimated fair market value in accordance with fas no 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge under fas no 
or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative are recognized as a component of revenue or cost of revenue based on the underlying transaction type in the consolidated statement of income 
derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting may be designated as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
for our fair value hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge instrument and the hedged item are recognized in the same line item as a component of either revenue or cost of revenue based on the underlying transaction type in the consolidated statement of income 
for our cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the changes in the fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently reclassified into the same line item as the forecasted transaction when both are settled  while the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of other non operating expense income in the consolidated statement of income 
cash flows for our hedging instruments used in our hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items 
if for any reason hedge accounting is discontinued  then any cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance shall be classified consistent with the nature of the instrument 
to qualify for hedge accounting  as either a fair value or cash flow hedge  the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective over an extended period of time in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk at the inception of the hedge 
we use a regression analysis based on historical spot prices in assessing the qualification for our fair value hedges 
however  our measurement of hedge ineffectiveness for our fair value inventory hedges utilizes spot prices for the hedged item inventory and forward or future prices for the hedge instrument 
therefore  the excluded component forward or futures prices in assessing hedge qualification  along with ineffectiveness  is included as a component of cost of revenue in earnings 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective and any previously recorded fair market value changes are not adjusted until the fuel is sold 
for additional information on derivatives  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this form k 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents our cost in excess of the estimated fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  of acquired companies and our joint venture interest in page avjet fuel co 
llc  a delaware limited liability company 
goodwill is not subject to periodic amortization  instead  it is reviewed annually at year end or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  which is the same as our reporting segments  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting segments is estimated using discounted cash flow and market capitalization methodologies 
in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded identifiable intangible assets existing at the date of the acquisitions for customer  charge card holder and merchant relationships  supplier relationships  non compete agreements and trademark trade name rights 
identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over their estimated lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on market factors and operational considerations 
identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
results of operations the results of operations for do not include the results of the texor business in our land segment since the acquisition was not completed until june   and only include the results of avcard in our aviation segment for the month of december since the acquisition was not completed until december  the results of operations for include the results of the texor business since june  and the full year results of avcard 
compared to revenue 
our revenue for was billion  an increase of billion  or  as compared to the significant increase in revenue from in total is primarily due to the rise in prices during most of the first three quarters of despite a sharp decline in oil prices during the fourth quarter 
our revenue during these years was attributable to the following segments in thousands change marine segment aviation segment land segment total our marine segment contributed billion in revenue for  an increase of billion  or  as compared to of the total increase in marine segment revenue  billion was due to an increase in the average price per metric ton sold as a result of higher world oil prices in the remaining increase of approximately million was due to increased sales volume to both new and existing customers

partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of million in provision for bad debt and million in executive severance costs incurred during the increase in compensation and employee benefits was primarily due to new hires to support our continued growing global business and the full year effect on compensation and employee benefits relating to new hires  partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation 
included in general and administrative expenses for was an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of for internally developed computer software costs related to an aviation project 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses of million was primarily attributable to the following expenses systems development  which included costs related to our enterprise integration project  professional and consulting fees  business travel  depreciation and amortization  office rent and telecommunication expenses 
the decrease in provision for bad debt was primarily due to an overall improved quality of our receivable portfolio during as compared to  primarily in the aviation and land segments

other expense and income  net 
in  we had other income  net  of million  a decrease of approximately million  as compared to other income  net  of million for the decrease in other income  net  was primarily due to a million investment impairment charge resulting from the write down of our commercial paper investment  foreign currency exchange losses reported for as compared to foreign currency exchange gains reported for  and a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and lower average invested balances 
partially offsetting these decreases was lower interest expense as a result of the capitalization of interest expenses of approximately million related to our enterprise integration project 
taxes 
for  our effective tax rate was and our income tax provision was million  as compared to an effective tax rate of and an income tax provision of million for the higher effective tax rate for resulted primarily from additional income tax expense recorded in connection with the new accounting guidance of financial accounting standard board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin in  as well as fluctuations in the actual results achieved by our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with different tax rates 
net income and diluted earnings per share 
net income for was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to diluted earnings per share for was per share  an increase of per share  or  as compared to liquidity and capital resources in  worldwide capital and credit markets experienced unprecedented volatility  and we continue to closely monitor the potential impact of these market conditions on our liquidity 
despite this unprecedented volatility  to date  these market conditions have not had a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
in fact  our liquidity and positive cash flow have increased primarily due to decreased world oil prices  the execution of a master accounts receivable purchase agreement and generation of positive cash flow through our focus on managing working capital  which resulted in a decrease in our net trade cycle 
cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million of cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash as of december  our primary use of cash and cash equivalents is to fund accounts receivable and purchase inventory 
we are usually extended unsecured trade credit from our suppliers for our fuel purchases  however  certain suppliers require us to provide a letter of credit 
our ability to fund fuel purchases  obtain trade credit from our suppliers and provide letters of credit is critical to our business 
increases in oil prices can negatively affect liquidity by increasing the amount of cash needed to fund fuel purchases as well as reducing the amount of fuel which we can purchase on an unsecured basis from our suppliers 
short term investments 
as of december  and  our short term investments consisted of million of commercial paper with a par value of million  which was investment grade when purchased 
on the maturity date of the investment in august  the issuer of the commercial paper defaulted on its repayment obligation 
as a result  the commercial paper has been reclassified from cash equivalents to short term investments 
the commercial paper is classified as a short term investment as of december  based on information available to us that suggests that it is likely there will be a cash settlement of the commercial paper within one year 
changes in facts and circumstances in future periods could lead to changes in the expected settlement date of the commercial paper balances 
accordingly  there may be changes in our classification of such balances from short term to long term 
in april  the commercial paper issuer was placed into receivership 
the commercial paper is no longer highly liquid and an observable market does not exist  therefore a readily determinable fair market value of the investment is not available 
on february   the high court of justice  chancery division  companies court in the united kingdom ruled that  based on the maturity date of the commercial paper held by us  we should receive payment ahead of other holders of the commercial paper 
the judgment is subject to appeal and leave to appeal has been granted 
we believe  based on discussions with our outside counsel  that we should prevail against an appeal should one be filed 
as of december   the receiver for the issuer provided us with information regarding the issuer s estimated investments and debt obligations 
the issuer s net assets represent the estimated market value of the issuer s investments using i the present value of future principal and interest payments receivable discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  and or ii individual valuation estimates of the underlying collateral using multiple indicators of value less the issuer s estimated debt obligations 
in order to estimate the fair market value of our investment in the commercial paper  we gave primary consideration to the court judgment noted above as well as consideration of the probabilities of repayment from the issuer s net assets under various liquidation scenarios based on the issuer s estimated investments and debt obligations 
the results of the commercial paper valuation yielded a range of estimated fair market values of approximately million to million 
based on the above  we believe the adjusted cost basis of our commercial paper is million at december  the estimated fair market value of our commercial paper could change significantly based on future market conditions  and the ultimate settlement of our commercial paper could be for amounts materially different from our current estimate of fair market value 
as a result  additional impairment charges may be required in the future 
credit facility 
our credit facility permits borrowings of up to million with a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit and bankers acceptances 
under the credit facility  we have the right to request increases in available borrowings up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at december  and million at december  our issued letters of credit under the credit facility totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
no bankers acceptances had been issued under our credit facility at december  and we had million of availability under our credit facility at december  the credit facility expires on december  based on information available to us  all of the financial institutions participating under our syndicated credit facility are able to fulfill their commitments as of our filing date 
however  there can be no assurance that the financial institutions will continue to fulfill their funding obligations under the credit facility in the future 
outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments fluctuate primarily based on operating cash flow  most significantly  the timing of receipts from our customers and payments to our suppliers 
higher interest rates can have a negative effect on our liquidity due to higher costs of borrowing under our credit facility 
our credit facility contains certain operating and financial covenants with which we are required to comply 
our failure to comply with the operating and financial covenants contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default 
an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility  trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party and impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facility 
accounts receivable facility 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a master accounts receivable purchase agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions establishing a facility the receivable facility to sell up to an aggregate of million of our accounts receivable on a revolving basis 
the receivable facility may be increased to up to million  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  and matures in september unless an event of termination occurs or the term is extended for subsequent one year terms with the prior written consent of the syndicate of financial institutions 
the receivable facility contains customary termination events  including  among other things  the failure to make timely payments under the receivable facility  the breach of covenants  and the occurrence and continuance of events of default under our credit facility 
as of december   no accounts receivable had been sold under our receivable facility 
we are also closely monitoring the potential impact of changes in the financial conditions of our customers  which to date have not had a material adverse impact on our operating results 
other credit lines 
we have unsecured credit lines aggregating million for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees 
letters of credit issued under these credit lines are subject to fees at market rates payable semiannually and at maturity in arrears 
these credit lines are renewable on an annual basis 
as of december  and december   our outstanding bank guarantees under these credit lines totaled million and million  respectively 
additionally  we have a separate million credit facility for the issuance of bankers acceptances the ba facility with one of the banks participating in our credit facility 
the ba facility is a continuing facility that will remain in full force and effect until revoked by us or the bank 
bankers acceptances issued under the ba facility are subject to commissions and fees finance charges at the bank s prevailing rate on the date of acceptance 
as of december   we recorded debt of million  net of unamortized finance charges of million  under the ba facility 
we believe that available funds from existing cash and cash equivalents  our credit facility and the receivable facility  together with cash flows generated by operations  remain sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  to further enhance our liquidity profile we may choose to raise additional funds which may or may not be needed for additional working capital  capital expenditures or other strategic investments 
our opinions concerning liquidity are based on currently available information 
to the extent this information proves to be inaccurate  or if circumstances change  future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity would be adversely affected 
factors that may affect the availability of trade credit  or other forms of financing  include our performance as measured by various factors  including cash provided from operating activities  the state of worldwide credit markets  and our levels of outstanding debt 
financing may not be available when needed or desired on terms favorable to us 
in october  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program 
the program does not require a minimum number of shares to be purchased and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
as of december   no shares of our common stock had been repurchased under this program 
the timing and amount of shares to be repurchased under the program will depend on market conditions  share price  securities law and other legal requirements and other factors
