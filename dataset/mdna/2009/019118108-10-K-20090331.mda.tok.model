item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands of dollars  other than share data overview allied is a multinational defense business focused on the manufacture and sale of ammunition and ammunition related products for use by the us and foreign governments 
allied s strategic business is conducted by its two wholly owned subsidiaries mecar sa mecar and mecar usa  inc mecar usa 
mecar is located in nivelles  belgium and mecar usa is located in marshall  texas 
corporate is located in vienna  virginia 
expenses related to corporate and foreign holding companies are reported separately in the segment reporting schedules 
prior to the fourth quarter of  allied had operated within two primary business segments  the ammunition weapons effects segment awe and the electronic security es segment 
in order to focus on its core competency in ammunition and reduce its debt  the company began divesting certain of its business units in since  allied sold one business that had been in the awe segment  titan dynamic systems  inc titan  one business that had been in the company s other segment  seaspace corporation seaspace and divested the vsk group vsk and global microwave systems inc gms  which constitute all but one of its es business units 
in the fourth quarter of  the company committed to a formal plan to divest the last remaining business in the es segment  news sports microwave rental  inc nsm 
as a result  allied has realigned its operating segments into mecar and mecar usa  as follows mecar 
mecar designs  develops  manufactures and sells ammunition and ammunition related products for military use 
substantially all of mecar s revenues are derived from the sale of ammunition which is used with weapons that are generally considered defensive weapons 
from time to time  mecar provides system integration services pursuant to which it purchases and resells weapon systems  ammunition manufactured by others or consulting services to governments looking to develop their own manufacturing capabilities in types of ammunition not manufactured by mecar 
mecar s manufactured products consist of a wide variety of ammunition and grenades in the medium caliber  artillery  anti tank and anti material categories 
mecar usa 
mecar usa purchases and resells ammunition and ammunition related products manufactured by others for the benefit of the u 
s government and foreign governments 
mecar usa substantially expanded this procurement business in mecar usa also pursues manufacturing contracts from the us government and others for ammunition and pyrotechnics devices 
mecar usa became operational in late following the construction of a new facility in marshall  texas 
allied  the parent company  provides oversight and corporate services to its subsidiaries and has no operating activities 
segment data set forth herein for prior periods has been revised to conform to the current mecar and mecar usa operating segments 
the company continues to evaluate its strategic options 
the company has committed to a plan to sell nsm 
in addition  the board of directors of the company continues to evaluate a possible disposition of all operating units of the company and the return of the net remaining proceeds to the shareholders 
the board will continue to evaluate alternatives to maximizing shareholder value through either the divestiture process or a more focused  cohesive business strategy centered on the mecar and mecar usa 
liquidity and capital resources during the last few years  the company faced liquidity challenges resulting mainly from the reduction of revenues and significant operating losses at mecar 
in addition  the company s liquidity was adversely affected by financing and restructuring costs 
during that time  the company implemented a plan to reduce the fixed operating cost base at mecar and nsm 
the corporate headquarters also engaged in cost cutting measures and committed to a plan to divest non core subsidiaries and repay its convertible notes and mecar s revolving cash line 
since  the company has divested several of its non core subsidiaries and improved its operating results 
the divestitures have permitted the company to repay its debt and eliminate smaller non profitable subsidiaries 
the company fully repaid its convertible notes  with the last payment made in january in april  mecar reached an agreement with its existing bank group regarding its credit facility 
the agreement provided for an expansion of the total credit facility from approximately   to  
the credit facility was restructured and the portion designated for tax prepayments was terminated 
the agreement provided for a cash line of   and performance bond and advance payment guarantee line of  
the agreement required a partial repayment of mecar s cash line of   in july and the remainder to be repaid by november  the performance bond and advance payment guarantee line expired on december  based on the timing of mecar s shipments in july  the company was unable to repay half of the cash line by july   but subsequently made the required repayments to the banking facility in the third quarter of and the remaining   by november  with cash generated from operations 
mecar is in continuing discussions with its bank group regarding an additional extension of the performance bond and advance payment guarantee line in the extension would provide an initial line of   and then by august   the line would be reduced to  
the extension would expire on march  and one of the members of the bank group that represents approximately of the credit would potentially cease to issue new bonds or guarantees after october  in line with mecar s projected facility requirements  the facility will gradually be lowered after october  to compensate for the exit of one member to approximately  
the refinancing of the credit facility  particularly the performance bond and advance payment guarantee facility  is critical to the company s ability to sign new contracts and continue on a long term basis 
all mecar s current funded backlog is covered by required performance bonds and credit guarantees 
mecar was able to open performance bonds and credit guarantees for new contracts through february under a temporary extension of the facility 
since the current funded backlog is covered by the performance bonds and credit guarantees  executions of the current funded backlog is not dependent on a refinancing of the credit facility 
if this extension is not secured  the company will continue to look for new financial institutions that are interested in this type of line 
this search may inhibit the company s ability to open new performance bonds and advance payment guarantees and thereby begin new contracts until a new line is secured 
in december  the company announced that mecar usa was awarded  as a subcontractor to a prime contractor in a us government contract  a contract for more than  that would be executed during in february  this contract was expanded to approximately  this new contract  in addition to an already higher contracted backlog at mecar  provided backlog of  at december   an increase of from the balance at december  this increased backlog will require the company to expand its working capital in the first eight months of in addition to the normal working capital build that is required to deliver on the existing backlog  mecar is prohibited from shipping to its largest customer  due to said customer s terms  in the summer months of late may through mid september 
at december   the company had  in cash on hand 
for the year ended december   the continuing operations of the company used  of cash from operating activities 
this usage stems mainly from the  net loss  increases in working capital  particularly accounts receivable  and the reduction of customer deposits  accounts payable and accrued liabilities at mecar as the sales contracts that were manufactured in were shipped in the fourth quarter of outlook for the company s cash projections for require additional working capital funding through the summer months with the company generating cash in the third and fourth quarters of current projections have a shortfall of available cash in august  however the company has a list of actions to remediate that shortfall 
upon execution of these actions  management is confident that the company will be able to work through this shortfall 
the company is also evaluating additional working capital financing 
in march  mecar usa signed a commitment with a us bank for a  working capital revolving credit and contract guidance facility 
this new facility will provide  of revolving credit based upon an agreed upon borrowing base calculation and  of financing based on working capital requirements of specific sales contracts that the lender agrees to finance 
mecar usa s credit facility will expire on june  and will pay interest at the rate of the day london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin 
today  that interest rate is with the applicable margin equal to per annum 
this working capital financing should enable mecar usa to perform on its  of backlog that was outstanding at december  the company is working to close this facility in april mecar is in the process of negotiating an final agreement with its bank group to continue to finance the performance bond and advance payment guarantee portion of the credit facility until march the cash portion of the line will not be renewed 
the company is managing the cash requirements at all of its business units with its existing cash balances 
mecar is currently taking certain actions to reduce the seasonality and its shipping constraints and may look for additional financing or an additional restructuring of the its credit facility in order to provide additional working capital

cost of sales as a percentage of revenue by segment of of segment segment amount revenue amount revenue mecar mecar usa total the improvement in the gross margin for the year ended december  was due to higher revenue levels 
in  mecar s costs of sales exceeded revenues as a result of a low level of revenues on mecar s high fixed cost structure 
current year production levels more than compensated for the fixed cost structure at mecar 
the current year results were negatively impacted by several factors as mecar substantially ramped up its business from the very low level 
for example  cost of goods sold was negatively affected by overtime pay and shift premiums required due to late deliveries of supplies 
the overtime was required to meet customer delivery schedules and to avoid contractual penalties for late deliveries 
in addition  in december  mecar encountered technical difficulties in connection with a new product which failed to meet customer specifications  which has been resolved subsequently in this failure resulted in an adjustment of contract profitability and revenue recognition  thereby negatively impacting gross profit by  gross profit for mecar was  of segment revenue in as compared to a gross loss of  of segment revenue in for the year ended december   gross profit for mecar usa was  of segment revenue compared to a gross loss of of segment revenue in the prior year 
gross margins for mecar usa s procurement contracts are inherently less than for mecar s manufacturing business 
moreover  in  mecar usa operated on lower than usual gross margins in order to obtain its initial procurement contracts 
this past performance has enabled mecar usa to compete in more contract bids and grow its revenue base 
mecar usa anticipates its gross margin will improve further in selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative sa expenses as a percentage of revenue were and for and  respectively 
the table below shows sa expenses by segment for the two year period 
selling and administrative expenses by segment of of amount total amount total mecar mecar usa corporate total the increase of  at mecar was mainly due to a higher level of spending in professional services for the restructuring activities and increased payroll costs resulting from the increased level of operating activity in the current period

impairment of long lived assets 
in september  corporate recorded in impairment charges for long lived assets related to the corporate s erp computer system

on december   the company s stock closed at per common share as compared to per common share on december  see note l for a description of these instruments 
other net 
other net for the year ended december  increased to a loss of  from a loss of in the prior year 
this unfavorable result was associated with mecar s foreign currency transactions 
approximately  of this loss is attributed to unrealized losses from the changes in fair value of its participating forward european currency contracts 
mecar had participating forward european currency contracts in place mainly for a significant us dollar denominated sales contract that spans over the next three years 
at the signing of the sales contract mecar entered into the forward currency contract to protect mecar s anticipated profitability on this contract 
subsequent to entering into the forward currency contract  the us dollar has gotten stronger  thereby yielding unrealized losses on an interim basis relative to the life of the forward contract 
as the company does not designate these contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges  changes in fair value must be as reported in the statement of operations

income loss from discontinued operations consisted of gain on sale of subsidiaries and loss from discontinued operations 
the company had income  net of tax of  of for the year ended december  compared to income of  in the same prior comparable year 
this decline was due to a one time significant net gain of  recognized from the sale of the vsk group in as compared to a lower net gain of  recognized from the sale of gms and titan in for the year ended december   the operating loss from discontinued operations was  which resulted from a loss at nsm of  and a loss at titan of offset by income at gms of  the net loss at nsm included a goodwill impairment of  the operating loss from discontinued operations for was  and included  loss from nsm   loss from titan   loss from seaspace and loss from cms offset by income of  and  from gms and the vsk group  respectively 
net loss

the prior year earnings from discontinued operations benefited from a  gain recorded on the sale of vsk in september the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the current year was  shares as compared to  shares in the prior year 
the increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in mainly resulted from the issuance of  shares in late june in conjunction with the company s restructuring and refinancing of its convertible notes 
in calculating the weighted average shares outstanding in  these shares were outstanding just over half of the year  thereby reducing the weighted average as compared to backlog 
as of december   the company s firm committed backlog was  compared to  at december  this backlog is calculated by taking all committed contracts and orders and deducting shipments or revenue recognized pursuant to the percentage of completion method of accounting  as applicable 
the table below shows the backlog by each entity for the two year period

these are contracts or portions of contracts that do not have all of the appropriate approvals to be performed on 
in most cases  these contracts require a formal budget approval before they can be added to the funded  firm backlog 
the increase in current year s backlog was attributable to mecar s receipt of funding on the second tranche of the july contract in the current period that previously has been reported as unfunded 
the improvement in mecar usa s backlog has driven principally by new procurement contracts received in  including a new  award in december balance sheet

the restricted cash balance consists mainly of mecar s customer deposits of which a portion has been restricted to secure bank issued advance payment guarantees 
the reduction in the restricted cash balance from december  was associated with local government support in belgium that began in april which guaranteed a larger portion of mecar s performance bonds and advance payment guarantees for mecar s bank group  thereby reducing the restricted cash requirements 
these additional guarantees by the local government are anticipated to be in place until mid the unrestricted cash balances have decreased  to  at december  as compared  at december  this reduction is due to the repayment of  in outstanding principal due on the convertible notes and cash used in operations of  in offset by proceeds received from the sale of gms in accounts receivable at december  increased by  from december  primarily due to the higher billings at mecar offset by increased collections in mecar usa 
costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased by  from the year ended december  primarily due to completion and shipment of a large mecar contract in  thereby reducing the amount of unbilled contracts at the end of the year

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates or judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies which affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts foreign currency translations derivative instruments valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
revenue recognition 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method is used by mecar for substantially all of its fixed price sales contracts 
approximately and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  using the percentage of direct labor incurred to total estimated direct labor 
management reviews these estimates as work progresses and the effect of any change in cost estimates is reflected in the calculation of the expected margin and the percent complete 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
accounting for the profit on a contract requires the total contract value  the estimated total direct labor cost to complete which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred labor costs to date on the contract and the estimated labor costs to complete the contract s scope of work  and or the actual total cost to date on the contract and the total estimated cost to complete the contract s scope of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances and testing requirements 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by the subsidiaries  coupled with the experience of their management teams  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual results will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
on contracts that do not qualify for the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized using the completed contract method under which revenue is recognized when the contract is completed or substantially completed 
using the completed contract method  we recognize revenue on a shipment basis  usually fob shipping point 
revenues from pass through contracts are evaluated based on the guidelines of eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
accordingly  the company bases its decision on whether to report revenue from such pass through contracts on a gross basis or net basis based on the relative strength of each of the following factors whether the company is the primary obligor in the arrangement  has general inventory risk  has latitude in establishing price  changes the product or performed part of the service  has discretion in supplier selection and is involved in the determination of product or service specifications 
there are no provisions related to performance  cancellation  termination or refunds 
inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on the weighted average cost method 
the company s inventory reserves include raw materials  work in process and finished goods of  as of december  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and the age of the item  and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
some of our customers share the same weapons platforms 
for these customers  mecar  at times  produces inventory in anticipation of receiving signed contracts for their manufacture 
this inventory  while designated for a particular contract  can be used to fulfill other contracts as long as the customer uses the same weapons platform 
at times the company may have inventory in excess of the amount designated in a signed contract 
the company feels that this inventory is still realizable as it is able to sell it to other customers that share the same platforms 
allowances for doubtful accounts are evaluated based upon detailed analysis and assessment of receivables that may not be collected in the normal course of operations 
foreign currency translation 
the assets and liabilities of arc europe  its subsidiary mecar  and arc limited  are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates 
the resulting translation gains and losses are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
in years with greater currency fluctuation  the impact on the apparent change for the same line item eg property  plant equipment would appear more significant than if all assets or liabilities were held in the same functional currency eg us dollars 
as of december   of all company assets are located in belgium  making the company sensitive to year to year fluctuations in currency  particularly the euro 
income and expense items are converted into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are credited or charged directly to operations 
for  revenue from belgium represented of the total revenue for the company 
the company recognizes the significance of foreign subsidiary operations on reported financial results thus making this a critical accounting policy 
derivative instruments 
the company designates its derivatives based upon the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company no longer utilizes derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges 
therefore  changes in fair value of the company s derivatives are recognized currently in net income 
the company believes that derivative accounting is critical to its estimates and financial reporting 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
the company is subject to taxation by federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the company believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities and reviews those balances on a quarterly basis 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
currently  the company has full valuation allowances recorded for all deferred tax assets based mainly on the substantial losses incurred over the past four years 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of these valuation allowances on a quarterly basis as mecar performs on its substantial backlog
