item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources and commitments historically  we have funded our operations  acquisitions  exploration and development expenditures from cash generated by operating activities  bank borrowings and issuance of common stock 
our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to secure our revolving line of credit 
in the past two fiscal years  we have obtained additional financing for prospects by selling fractional working interests to industry partners at prices in excess of our cost 
our long term strategy is on increasing profit margins while concentrating on obtaining reserves with low cost operations by acquiring and developing primarily gas properties and secondarily oil properties with potential for long lived production 
in fiscal  we primarily used cash provided by operations  to fund oil and gas property acquisitions and development 
we had working capital of  as of march  compared to working capital of  as of march   a decrease of  this was mainly a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents 
the accounts receivable decrease was mainly a result of a decrease in oil and gas sales during the fourth quarter from a decrease in oil and gas prices 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we acted as operator and drilled an exploratory well in loving county  texas which has been completed 
we have acquired right of way  built a pipeline and commenced testing and sales of natural gas from this well 
our share of the costs incurred for this project through april for our working interest is approximately  on june  we purchased mineral and royalty interests contained in an aggregate of acres with royalties varying from 
to 
in producing natural gas wells  proven undeveloped well locations and an additional potential drill sites in the newark east barnett shale field of tarrant county  texas for approximately  this acreage now has producing natural gas wells with an additional well currently being drilled 
we subsequently purchased additional royalties in this acreage on march  for approximately  effective july   we purchased a well in loving county  texas which is capable of producing from the lower cherry canyon section 
we are acting as operator and have re entered the well  tested one horizon as non productive and tested the bell canyon  for which we are currently purchasing right of way for transmission and sales of natural gas 
our share of the costs for our working interest through april is approximately  in september  we committed to participate in the drilling of a development well in limestone county  texas 
this well has been completed and is currently producing 
costs incurred for this project through april are approximately  in september  we acted as operator and re entered a well in ward county  texas to an approximate depth of  feet to test the upper and lower pennsylvanian intervals 
this well was recompleted  perforated  acid fraced and is currently being tested after completion of a pipeline for sales of natural gas 
costs incurred for this project through april for our working interest are approximately  we also own a overriding royalty interest in this well 
on october   we purchased interests in approximately mineral acres amounting to an approximate net royalty in three gas wells located in johnson county  texas for approximately  this property contains three development wells in the newark east barnett shale field which were put on production in mid november approximately of the acres are outside of the drilling and spacing unit for these three wells and are also available for further development 
a family limited partnership of a director and employee of the company received a finder s fee of of the mineral interest purchased in lieu of a cash payment as disclosed in a report to the sec on form k dated october  we continue to focus our efforts on the acquisition of royalties in areas with significant development potential 
we are participating in other projects and are reviewing projects in which we may participate 
the cost of such projects would be funded  to the extent possible  from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations 
the remainder may be funded through borrowings on the credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na crude oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years 
during the second quarter of fiscal  oil and gas prices began trending downward  while drilling  completion and operating costs remained high 
the effect of declining product prices on our business is significant 
lower product prices reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves 
lower product prices also offer us less incentive to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business 
the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  the west texas intermediate wti posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per bbl in december to a high of per bbl in july the henry hub spot market price henry hub for natural gas has ranged from a low of per mmbtu in march to a high of in july per mmbtu 
on march  the wti posted price for crude oil was per bbl and the henry hub spot price for natural gas was per mmbtu 
management is of the opinion that cash flow from operations and funds available from financing will be sufficient to provide adequate liquidity for the next fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net income increased from  for the year ended march  to  for the year ended march   an increase of 
oil and gas sales 
revenue from oil and gas sales increased from  in to  in this increase was attributable to an increase in oil price and gas production partially offset by a decrease in gas prices and oil production 
the average oil price increased from per bbl in to per bbl in and the average gas price decreased from in to per mcf in production and exploration 
production costs decreased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of a decrease in repairs and maintenance to operated wells in the el cinco field offset by increased production and ad valorem taxes due to the increase in oil and gas sales and gas production 
oil production decreased from  bbls in to  bbls in and gas production increased from  mcf in to  mcf in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense increased from  in to  in due to an increase in production and an increase in full cost pool partially offset by an increase in gas reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of an increase in salaries 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in due to a decrease in average borrowings and interest rates during the current fiscal year 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased from  in to  in  an increase of  this increase was attributable to our increased income 
fiscal compared to fiscal net income increased from  for the year ended march  to  for the year ended march   an increase of 
oil and gas sales 
revenue from oil and gas sales increased from  in to  in this increase was attributable to an increase in oil and gas prices and oil and gas production 
the average oil price increased from per bbl in to per bbl in and the average gas price increased from in to per mcf in production and exploration 
production costs increased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of an increase in repairs and maintenance to operated wells in the el cinco field and increased production taxes due to the increase in oil and gas sales and production 
oil production increased from  bbls in to  bbls in and gas production increased from  mcf in to  mcf in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
dd a expense increased from  in to  in due to an increase in production and an increase in full cost pool partially offset by an increase in reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of a decrease in stock option compensation expense partially offset by an increase in engineering and geological services for evaluation of projects 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from  in to  in due to an increase in average borrowings during the current fiscal year 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased from a tax benefit of  in to a tax expense of  in  an increase of  this increase was attributable to our increased income and a small revision of prior year estimates 
alternative capital resources although we have primarily used cash from operating activities and funding from the line of credit as our primary capital resources  we have in the past  and could in the future  use alternative capital resources 
these could include joint ventures  carried working interests and the sale of assets and or issuances of common stock through a private placement or public offering of our common stock 
contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table summarizes our future payments we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of march  payments due in total less than year years years contractual obligations secured bank line of credit does not include estimated interest of  less than year and  years 
these amounts represent the balances outstanding under the bank line of credit 
these repayments assume that interest will be paid on a monthly basis and that no additional funds will be drawn 
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing financial statements  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes  fair value and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aro when incurred 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher dd a rate on our crude oil and natural gas properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us more susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
our crude oil and natural gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
ceiling test 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher crude oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report was based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost projects 
use of estimates 
in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although management believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
significant estimates affecting these financial statements include the estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  the related present value of estimated future net cash flows and the future development  dismantlement and abandonment costs 
excluded costs 
oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
these costs are excluded until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
revenue recognition 
we recognize crude oil and natural gas revenue from our interest in producing wells as crude oil and natural gas is sold from those wells  net of royalties 
we utilize the sales method to account for gas production volume imbalances 
under this method  income is recorded based on our net revenue interest in production taken for delivery 
we had no material gas imbalances 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated by the units of production method 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in the full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense

we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of fsp sfas no 
on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board s pcaob amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the effective date of sfas no 
was november  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the sec released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to a report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and c report oil and natural gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reports on forms k for fiscal years ending on or after december  the company is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this rule will have on our financial statements  which will vary depending on commodity prices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk factors the primary source of market risk for us includes fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
all of our financial instruments are for purposes other than trading 
at march   we had not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other similar agreements relating to crude oil and natural gas 
interest rate risk 
on march  we had an outstanding loan balance of  under our million revolving credit agreement  which bears interest at an annual rate equal to the british bankers association london interbank offered rate bba libor daily floating rate  plus percentage points 
if the interest rate on our bank debt increases or decreases by one percentage point our annual pretax income would change by  based on borrowings at march  credit risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of nonperformance by other parties of their contractual obligations 
our primary credit risk is related to oil and gas production sold to various purchasers and the receivables are generally not collateralized 
at march   our largest credit risk associated with any single purchaser was  we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance from any of our working interest partners 
at march   our largest credit risk associated with any working interest partner was  we have not experienced any significant credit losses 
energy price risk 
our most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas and crude oil 
our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices with any certainty 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
factors that can cause price fluctuations include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall political and economic conditions in oil producing countries 
declines in oil and natural gas prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
changes in oil and gas prices impact both estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to obtain additional capital for our exploration and development activities 
in addition  a noncash write down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if prices declined significantly  even if it is only for a short period of time 
see critical accounting policies and estimates ceiling test under item of this report on form k 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relationship to each other 
our financial results are more sensitive to movements in natural gas prices than oil prices because most of our production and reserves are natural gas 
if the average oil price had increased or decreased by one dollar per barrel for fiscal  our pretax income would have changed by  if the average gas price had increased or decreased by one dollar per mcf for fiscal  our pretax income would have changed by
