item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general new york mortgage trust  inc  together with its consolidated subsidiaries nymt  the company  we  our  and us  is a self advised real estate investment trust  or reit  that invests primarily in real estate related assets  including residential adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  which includes collateralized mortgage obligation floating rate securities rmbs  and prime credit quality residential adjustable rate mortgage arm loans prime arm loans  and to a lesser extent  in certain alternative real estate related and financial assets that present greater credit risk and less interest rate risk than our investments in rmbs and prime arm loans 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders resulting from the spread between the interest and other income we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on the borrowings that we use to finance these assets  which we refer to as our net interest income 
our investment strategy historically has focused on investments in rmbs issued or guaranteed by a us government agency such as the government national mortgage association  or ginnie mae  or by a us government sponsored entity such as the federal national mortgage association  or fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation  or freddie mac  prime arm loans  and non agency rmbs 
we refer throughout this annual report on form k to rmbs issued by a us government agency or us government sponsored entity as agency rmbs 
starting with the completion of our initial public offering in june  we began building a leveraged investment portfolio comprised largely of rmbs purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  and prime arm loans originated by us or purchased from third parties that we securitized and which are held in our securitization trusts 
since exiting the mortgage lending business on march   we have exclusively focused our resources and efforts on investing  on a leveraged basis  in rmbs and  since august  we have employed a portfolio strategy that focuses on investments in agency rmbs 
we refer to our historic investment strategy throughout this annual report on form k as our principal investment strategy 
in january  we formed a strategic relationship with jmp group inc  a full service investment banking and asset management firm  and certain of its affiliates collectively  the jmp group  for the purpose of improving our capitalization and diversifying our investment strategy away from a strategy exclusively focused on investments in agency rmbs  in part to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns  and to potentially utilize all or part of a million net operating loss carry forward that resulted from our exit from the mortgage lending business in in connection with this strategic relationship  the jmp group made a million investment in our series a cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock the series a preferred stock in january and purchased approximately million of our common stock in a private placement in february  in addition  in connection with the jmp group s strategic investment in us  james j 
fowler  a managing director of hcs defined below  became our non executive chairman of the board of directors 
as of december   jmp group inc and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the includes shares of series a preferred stock which may be converted into common stock 
in an effort to diversify our investment strategy  we entered into an advisory agreement with harvest capital strategies llc hcs  formerly known as jmp asset management llc  concurrent with the issuance of our series a preferred stock to the jmp group  pursuant to which hcs will implement and manage our investments in alternative real estate related and financial assets 
pursuant to the advisory agreement  hcs is responsible for managing investments made by two of our wholly owned subsidiaries  hypotheca capital  llc hc  also formerly known as the new york mortgage company  llc  and new york mortgage funding  llc  as well as any additional subsidiaries acquired or formed in the future to hold investments made on our behalf by hcs 
we refer to these subsidiaries in our periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission sec as the managed subsidiaries 
due to market conditions and other factors in  including the significant disruptions in the credit markets  we elected to forgo making investments in alternative real estate related and financial assets and instead  exclusively focused our resources and efforts on preserving capital and investing in agency rmbs 
however  we expect to begin the diversification of our investment strategy in by opportunistically investing in certain alternative real estate related and financial assets  or equity interests therein  including  without limitation  certain non agency rmbs and other non rated mortgage assets  commercial mortgage backed securities  commercial real estate loans  collateralized loan obligations and other investments 
we refer throughout this annual report on form k to our investment in alternative real estate related and financial assets  other than agency rmbs  prime arm loans and non agency rmbs that are already held in our investment portfolio  as our alternative investment strategy and such assets as our alternative assets 
generally  we expect that our investment in alternative assets will be made on a non levered basis  will be conducted through the managed subsidiaries and will be managed by hcs 
currently  we have established for our alternative assets a targeted range of to of our total assets  subject to market conditions  credit requirements and the availability of appropriate market opportunities 
we expect to benefit from the jmp group s and hcs investment expertise  infrastructure  deal flow  extensive relationships in the financial community and financial and capital structuring skills 
moreover  as a result of the jmp group s and hcs investment expertise and knowledge of investment opportunities in multiple asset classes  we believe we have preferred access to a unique source of investment opportunities that may be in discounted or distressed positions  many of which may not be available to other companies that we compete with 
we intend to be selective in our investments in alternative assets  seeking out co investment opportunities with the jmp group where available  conducting substantial due diligence on the alternative assets we seek to acquire and any loans underlying those assets  and limiting our exposure to losses by investing in alternative assets on a non levered basis 
by diversifying our investment strategy  we intend to construct an investment portfolio that  when combined with our current assets  will achieve attractive risk adjusted returns and that is structured to allow us to maintain our qualification as a reit and the requirements for exclusion from regulation under the investment company act of  as amended  or investment company act 
because we intend to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and to operate our business so as to be exempt from regulation under the investment company act  we will be required to invest a substantial majority of our assets in qualifying real estate assets  such as agency rmbs  mortgage loans and other liens on and interests in real estate 
therefore  the percentage of our assets we may invest in corporate investments and other types of instruments is limited  unless those investments comply with various federal income tax requirements for reit qualification and the requirements for exclusion from investment company act regulation 

table of contents factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our results of operations and financial condition are affected by various factors  including  among other things changes in interest rates  rates of prepayment and default on our assets or the mortgages or loans that underlie such assets  general economic and financial and credit market conditions  our leverage  our access to funding and our borrowing costs  our hedging activities  changes in the credit ratings of the loans  securities  and other assets we own  the market value of our investments  liabilities related to our discontinued operations  including repurchase obligations on the sales of mortgage loans  and requirements to maintain reit status and to qualify for an exemption from registration under the investment company act 
we earn income and generate cash through our investments 
our income is generated primarily from the net spread  which we refer to as net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our investment portfolio and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities 
our net interest income will vary based upon  among other things  the difference between the interest rates earned on our interest earning assets and the borrowing costs of the liabilities used to finance those investments  prepayment speeds and default rates on the assets or the loans underlying such assets 
because changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks effectively while maintaining our status as a reit 
we anticipate that  for any period during which changes in the interest rates earned on our assets do not coincide with interest rate changes on our borrowings  such assets will reprice more slowly than the corresponding liabilities 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may significantly influence our net interest income 
because the maturities of our assets generally have longer terms than those of our liabilities  interest rate increases will tend to decrease our net interest income and the market value of our assets and therefore our book value 
such rate increases could possibly result in operating losses or adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the yield on our assets may be affected by a difference between the actual prepayment rates and our projections 
prepayment rates  as reflected by the rate of principal paydown  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the economy and financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
to the extent we have acquired assets at a premium or discount to par  or face value  changes in prepayment rates may impact our anticipated yield 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments on our assets will likely increase 
if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of such prepayments at comparable yields  our net interest income will be negatively impacted 
the current climate of government intervention in the mortgage markets significantly increases the risk associated with prepayments 
while we historically have used  and intend to use in the future  hedging to mitigate some of our interest rate risk  we do not hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our portfolio from all potential negative consequences associated with changes in short term interest rates in a manner that will allow us to seek attractive net spreads on our assets 

table of contents in addition  our returns will be affected by the credit performance of our non agency rmbs and other investments 
if credit losses on our investments  loans  or the loans underlying our investments increase  it may have an adverse effect on our performance 
as it relates to loans sold previously under certain loan sale agreements by our discontinued mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
while in the past we complied with the repurchase demands by repurchasing the loan with cash and reselling it at a loss  thus reducing our cash position  more recently we have addressed these requests by negotiating a net cash settlement based on the actual or assumed loss on the loan in lieu of repurchasing the loans 
as of december   the amount of repurchase requests outstanding was approximately million  against which we had a reserve of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in settling the remaining repurchase demands on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to continue to resolve our current repurchase demands through negotiated net cash settlements  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may be subject to new repurchase requests from investors with whom we have not settled or with respect to repurchase obligations not covered under the settlement

risk factors above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
current market conditions and known material trends general 
the well publicized disruptions in the credit markets that began in escalated throughout and spread to the financial markets and the greater economy 
during the year  global financial markets came under increased stress as problems in the us real estate and residential mortgage market spread to the broader economy and the global financial sector 
in addition  fears of a global recession increased and were exacerbated by further declines in the housing and credit markets in the us and europe  which heightened concerns over the creditworthiness of some financial institutions 
as a result  most sectors of the financial markets experienced significant declines during the year  including international equity and credit markets  driven  in part  by deleveraging and difficulty pricing risk in the market that has been affecting investors all over the world 
in response  various initiatives by the us government have been implemented to address credit and liquidity issues 
among other things  in september  fannie mae and freddie mac were placed under conservatorship by the fhfa and the us treasury department the treasury announced it would purchase senior preferred stock in fannie mae or freddie mac  if needed  to a maximum of billion per company in order that each maintains a positive net worth 
in october  the us treasury created the capital purchase program as part of the billion troubled asset relief program  allocating billion to invest in us financial institutions to help stabilize and strengthen the us financial system 
in november  the federal reserve bank of new york the federal reserve announced that it would buy up to billion of agency rmbs from fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  and in january  the federal reserve began to purchase agency rmbs in accordance with this initiative 
in march  the federal reserve announced that it was increasing its purchase commitment for agency rmbs by up to an additional billion 
we believe that the stronger backing for the guarantors of agency rmbs  resulting from the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac and the us treasury s commitment to purchase senior preferred stock in these companies has  and are expected to continue to  positively impact the value of our agency rmbs 
although the us government has committed capital to fannie mae and freddie mac  there can be no assurance that the credit facilities and other capital infusions will be adequate for their needs 
if the financial support is inadequate  these companies could continue to suffer losses and could fail to honor their guarantees and other obligations 
on february   the president of the united states announced the homeowner affordability and stability plan  or hasp  which is intended to stabilize the housing market by providing relief to distressed homeowners in an effort to reduce or forestall home foreclosures 
among other things  the hasp is designed to i enable responsible homeowners to refinance in certain instances where their home value has fallen below the amount outstanding on the homeowner s mortgage  ii address certain at risk homeowners by providing cash incentives to lenders to refinance the homeowner s mortgage to a lower interest rate and subsidizing in part a reduction in the outstanding mortgage principal  iii provide for an amendment of the bankruptcy laws to permit the modification of mortgage loans in bankruptcy proceedings and iv support lower mortgage interest rates by increasing the us treasury s preferred stock investment in each of fannie mae and freddie mac to billion  increasing the size of the companies retained mortgage portfolios to billion each and reaffirming its commitment to continue purchasing fannie mae and freddie mac issued rmbs 
this new us government program  as well as future legislative or regulatory actions  including amendments to the bankruptcy laws  that result in the modification of outstanding mortgage loans may adversely affect the value of  and the returns on  the agency rmbs in which we invest 
on march   the us treasury announced the creation of a public private investment program designed to attract private capital to purchase eligible legacy loans from participating banks and eligible legacy securities in the secondary market through fdic debt guarantees equity co investment by the us treasury and government supported term asset backed loan facilities  as applicable 
the outcome of these events remain highly uncertain and we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents mortgage asset values 
investors appetite for us mortgage assets remained weak throughout due to liquidations of large investment portfolios of mortgage assets in connection with forced and voluntary de leveraging in the mortgage asset industry in march  along with decreased demand for these assets among investors mortgage asset prices declined significantly in march prices improved during the second quarter of as fannie mae and freddie mac increased buying of agency securities for their portfolio 
however  during the third quarter prices were negatively impacted by events involving the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac and the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc more recently  the federal reserve s announcement on january  that it had begun to buy agency rmbs  resulted in an increase in the value of agency rmbs 
we believe that the stronger backing for the guarantors of agency rmbs  resulting from the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac  along with the us treasury s commitment to purchase senior preferred stock in these companies and the federal reserve s agency rmbs purchase program has  and are expected to continue to  positively impact the value of our agency rmbs 
financing markets and liquidity in connection with the market disruption of march  many financial institutions withdrew or reduced financing and liquidity that they typically offered clients as part of their daily business operations 
significant events in the financial markets in the second half of caused further tightening of lending standards and reduced overall market liquidity 
in march  the market experienced extreme liquidity dislocations as a result of a major broker dealer failure and several large hedge fund liquidations 
as a result of these events the secured borrowing terms changed significantly  increased haircuts along with reduced credit availability caused most leveraged investors to significantly reduce their portfolio leverage 
the company s average haircut increased to approximately at march  from at december  as of december   the company s average haircut was 
financing costs and interest rates the overall credit market deterioration since august has also affected prevailing interest rates 
for example  interest rates have been unusually volatile since the third quarter of since september   the us federal reserve has lowered the target for the federal funds rate from to a range between and 
historically  the day london interbank offered rate  or libor  has closely tracked movements in the federal funds rate 
our funding costs under repurchase agreements have traditionally tracked day libor 
the spread between libor and the fed funds rate was unusually volatile during  but narrowed considerably toward the end of as of december   day libor was while the fed funds rate was 
because of continued uncertainty in the credit markets and us economic conditions  we expect that interest rates are likely to experience continued volatility 
prepayment rates 
as a result of various government initiatives  rates on conforming mortgages have declined  nearing historical lows 
hybrid and adjustable rate mortgage originations have declined substantially  as rates on these types of mortgages are comparable with rates available on year fixed rate mortgages 
while such significant decreases in mortgage rates would typically foster mortgage refinancing  such activity has not occurred 
we believe that the decline in home values  increases in the jobless rate and the resulting deterioration in borrowers creditworthiness have limited refinance activity to date 
the recent creation of the hasp is aimed to further assist homeowners in refinancing and to reduce potential foreclosures 
although we expect that the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  will trend upward during based on current market interest rates  future cprs will be affected by the success of hasp and the timing and purpose of any future legislation  if any  and the resulting impact on borrowers ability to refinance  mortgage interest rates in the market and home values 

table of contents significant events in strategic relationship established with jmp group inc on january   we issued million shares of our series a preferred stock to jmp group inc and certain of its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of million 
concurrent with our issuance of the series a preferred stock  we entered into an advisory agreement with hcs  which is an affiliate of jmp group inc  to manage investments made by the managed subsidiaries 
we expect that hcs will assist us with the implementation of our alternative investment strategy  and once implemented  will manage our alternative investment strategy  as described more fully in item of this annual report on form k 
in acting as our advisor  hcs will play a key role in the sourcing of our alternative investment opportunities 
as of the date of this report  hcs had yet to manage any of our assets 
for more information regarding the terms of the advisory agreement  see our relationship with hcs and the advisory agreement in item of this annual report on form k and the advisory agreement itself  which is filed an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
the series a preferred stock entitles the holders to receive a cumulative dividend of per year  subject to an increase to the extent any future quarterly common stock dividends exceed per share 
the series a preferred stock matures on december   has a redemption value of per share  and is convertible into shares of the company s common stock based on a conversion price of per share of common stock  which represents a conversion rate of two and one half shares of common stock for each share of series a preferred stock 
completion of million offering of common stock on february   the company completed the issuance and sale of million shares of its common stock to certain accredited investors as such term is defined in rule of regulation d of the securities act of  as amended  or securities act at a price of per share 
this private offering of the company s common stock generated gross proceeds to the company of million  and net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
pursuant to a registration rights agreement  the company filed a resale shelf registration statement registering the resale of the shares sold in this offering  which became effective in april pursuant to the registration rights agreement  we paid million in liquidated damages in to the investors in the offering for not filing a resale shelf registration statement by the date required in the registration rights agreement and not obtaining nasdaq listing for our common stock on or prior to the effective date of the resale shelf registration statement 
we do not expect to incur future penalty fees under the registration rights agreement 
in accordance with our investment plan  we promptly deployed the net proceeds from our january and february equity offerings by purchasing an aggregate of approximately million of agency hybrid rmbs during january and february these acquisitions were financed in part with repurchase agreements and hedged with interest rate swaps 
march credit market disruption during march  news of potential and actual security liquidations negatively impacted market values for  and available liquidity to finance  certain mortgage securities  including some of our agency rmbs and aaa rated non agency rmbs  resulting in a significant deleveraging event for a relatively broad range of leveraged public and private companies with investment and financing strategies similar to ours 
in response to these significantly changed conditions  we undertook a number of strategic actions to reduce leverage and increase liquidity in our portfolio of agency rmbs 
during march  the company sold  in aggregate  approximately million of agency rmbs from its investment portfolio that was comprised of million of agency hybrid arm rmbs and million of agency cmo floating rate securities cmo floaters  resulting in a loss of million 
as a result of these sales of rmbs  we also terminated associated interest rate swaps that were used to hedge our liability costs with a notional balance of million at a cost of million 
we believe these proactive steps taken by our management team to reduce leverage and increase liquidity enabled our company to successfully navigate the extremely difficult operating and credit conditions facing companies with investment and financing strategies similar to ours 

table of contents subsequent events march restructuring of principal investment portfolio 
as of december   our principal investment portfolio included approximately million of collateralized mortgage obligation floating rate securities issued by an agency  which we refer to as agency cmo floaters 
following a review of our principal investment portfolio  we determined in march that the agency cmo floaters held in our portfolio were no longer producing acceptable returns  and as a result  we decided to initiate a program to dispose of these securities on an opportunistic basis 
as of march   the company had sold approximately million in current par value of agency cmo floaters under this program resulting in a net gain of approximately million 
as a result of these sales and our intent to sell the remaining agency cmo floaters in our principal investment portfolio  we concluded the reduction in value at december  was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of million for the quarter and year ended december  in addition  we also determined that million in current par value of non agency rmbs  which includes million in current par value of retained residual interest  had suffered an other than temporary impairment and  accordingly  recorded an impairment charge of million for the quarter and year ended december  note regarding discontinued operations in connection with the sale of our wholesale mortgage lending platform assets on february  and the sale of our retail mortgage lending platform assets to indymac bank  fsb indymac on march   during the fourth quarter of  we classified our mortgage lending business as a discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as a result  we have reported revenues and expenses related to the mortgage lending business as a discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities related to a discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain assets  such as the deferred tax asset  and certain liabilities  such as subordinated debt and liabilities related to leased facilities not assigned to indymac are part of our ongoing operations and accordingly  we have not classified as a discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
until march   our discontinued mortgage lending operation contributed to our then current period financial results 
subsequent to march   our discontinued mortgage lending operation has impacted our financial results due to liabilities remaining after the sale of the operation s assets 
as of december   discontinued operations consist of million in assets and million in liabilities  down from million in assets and million in liabilities as of december  prior to march   we originated a wide range of residential mortgage loan products including prime  alternative a  and to a lesser extent sub prime loans  home equity lines of credit  second mortgages  and bridge loans

conversely  if prepayment expectations decrease  the premium would be amortized over a longer period resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
we monitor our prepayment experience on a monthly basis and adjust the amortization rate to reflect current market conditions

the series a preferred stock matures on december  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  because of this mandatory redemption feature  the company classifies these securities as a liability on its balance sheet 
derivative assets and liabilities 
we generally hedge the risk related to changes in the benchmark interest rate used in the variable rate index  usually libor 
in order to reduce these risks  we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive floating rate payments in exchange for fixed rate payments  effectively converting our short term repurchase agreement borrowing or cdos to a fixed rate 
we also enter into interest rate cap agreements whereby  in exchange for a premium  we are reimbursed for interest paid in excess of a contractually specified capped rate 
derivative financial instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the institutional counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we attempted to minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with good credit ratings 
in addition  we regularly monitor the potential risk of loss with any one party resulting from this type of credit risk 
accordingly  we do not expect any material losses as a result of default by other parties  but can provide no assurance that we will avoid counter party failures 
we enter into derivative transactions solely for risk management purposes 
the decision of whether or not a given transaction  or a portion thereof  is hedged is made on a case by case basis  based on the risks involved and other factors as determined by senior management  including the financial impact on income and asset valuations and the restrictions imposed on reit hedging activities by the internal revenue code  among others 
in determining whether to hedge a risk  we may consider whether other assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions already offset or reduce the risk 
all transactions undertaken as a hedge are entered into with a view towards minimizing the potential for economic losses that could be incurred by us 
generally  all derivatives entered into are intended to qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with gaap  unless specifically precluded under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to this end  terms of the hedges are matched closely to the terms of hedged items

table of contents results of operations the following is a brief description of key terms from our consolidated financial statements revenues 
our primary source of income is net interest income on our portfolio of assets 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our assets  which for was rmbs and loans in securitization trusts  and interest expense  which is the interest we pay on borrowings  subordinated debt and convertible preferred debentures 
prior to our exit from the mortgage lending business in march  net interest income was also earned on the loan originations by hc for the period of time commencing upon the closing of a loan and ending upon the sale of such loan to a third party 
other expenses 
other expense includes loan losses for costs incurred with respect to  the disposition of non performing or early payment default loans we have originated or purchased from third parties or from losses incurred on non performing loans held in securitization trusts 
in addition  other expense includes net losses from the sale of investments securities or the early termination of interest rate swaps and losses from impairments on investment securities 
expenses 
non interest expenses we incur in operating our business consist primarily of salary and employee benefits  professional fees  insurance  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses include expenses for office rents  equipment rentals  office supplies  postage and shipping  telephone  travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
in  other expenses included the penalty payments paid to investors pursuant to a registration rights agreement we entered into in connection with our february common equity offering 
income loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations includes all revenues and expenses related to our discontinued mortgage lending business excluding those costs that will be retained by us  which are primarily expenses related to rent expense for leased locations not assigned as part of the disposition of our mortgage lending business and certain allocated payroll expenses for employees remaining with us 
our discontinued operations were profitable in due primarily to the rent reimbursement from indymac stemming from indymac s use of our former corporate headquarters through the end of july see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information regarding our discontinued operations

the decrease was due mainly to the elimination of non recurring charges that were recorded in  including an million charge to reserve of the deferred tax asset related to the discontinued business  a million operating loss for the mortgage origination business that was sold in march additionally  the net interest margin for the twelve months ended december  increased by million as compared to the same period in due to significant portfolio restructuring 
the company incurred a million non cash impairment in the fourth quarter of as compared to an million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in net loss of was due to the following factors an million charge to reserve of the deferred tax asset  a decrease in net interest margin of million  an million non cash impairment related to the investment portfolio  an increase of million related to losses on sale of securities and hedges and an increase in loan losses of million related to loans held in securitization trust

the net interest spread is impacted by factors such as our cost of financing  the interest rate our investments are earning and our interest hedging strategies 
furthermore  the cost of loans held in our portfolio  the amount of premium or discount paid on purchased portfolio investments and the prepayment rates on portfolio investments will impact the net interest spread as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not maintained any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  fund our operations  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available for our operating businesses and meet these potential cash requirements 
our investments and assets generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through mortgage principal and interest payments  prepayments and net earnings held prior to payment of dividends 
in addition  depending on market conditions  the sale of investment securities or capital market transactions may provide additional liquidity 
we intend to meet our liquidity needs through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
in connection with the march market disruption and the anticipated increase in collateral requirements by our lenders as a result of the decrease in the market value of our investment securities  we elected to increase our liquidity by reducing our leverage through the sale of an aggregate of approximately million of agency rmbs in march  which resulted in an aggregate loss of approximately million  including losses related to the termination of interest rate swaps 
at december   we had cash balances of million  million in unencumbered securities and borrowings of million under outstanding repurchase agreements 
at december   we also had longer term capital resources  including cdos outstanding of million and subordinated debt of million 
in addition  the company received net proceeds of million and million from private offerings of its series a preferred stock and common stock  respectively  in january and february the series a preferred stock matures on december   at which time any outstanding shares must be redeemed by us at the per share liquidation preference 
based on our current investment portfolio  leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements  we believe our existing cash balances  funds available under our current repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations will meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
however  should further volatility and deterioration in the broader credit  residential mortgage and mbs markets occur in the future  we cannot assure you that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements during the next months 
to finance our rmbs investment portfolio  we generally seek to borrow between seven and nine times the amount of our equity 
at december  our leverage ratio for our rmbs investment portfolio  which we define as our outstanding indebtedness under repurchase agreements divided by the sum of total stockholders equity and the convertible preferred debentures  was this definition of the leverage ratio is consistent with the manner in which the credit providers under our repurchase agreements calculate our leverage 
we had outstanding repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with six different financial institutions as of december  these agreements are secured by our mortgage backed securities and bear interest rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements are based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
interest rate changes can have a negative impact on the valuation of these securities  reducing the amount we can borrow under these agreements 
moreover  our repurchase agreements allow the counterparties to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions and because these lines of financing are not committed  the counterparty can call the loan at any time 
if a counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased  the counterparty may initiate a margin call and require us to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowing  on minimal notice 
moreover  in the event an existing counterparty elected to not reset the outstanding balance at its maturity into a new repurchase agreement  we would be required to repay the outstanding balance with cash or proceeds received from a new counterparty or to surrender the mortgage backed securities that serve as collateral for the outstanding balance  or any combination thereof 
if we are unable to secure financing from a new counterparty and had to surrender the collateral  we would expect to incur a significant loss 

table of contents in connection with the dramatic declines in the housing market and significant asset write downs by financial institutions  many investors and financial institutions that lend in the mortgage securities repurchase markets including some of the lenders under our repurchase agreements significantly tightened their lending standards and  in some cases  have ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
in our case  during march  we experienced increases in the amount of haircut  which is the difference between the value of the collateral and the loan amount  required to obtain financing for both our agency rmbs and non agency rmbs 
as of december   our rmbs securities portfolio consisted of approximately million of agency rmbs and million of non agency rmbs  which was financed with approximately million of repurchase agreement borrowing with an average haircut of 
although average haircuts have remained stable since the second quarter  any increase in haircuts by our lenders would materially adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 
moreover  in the event the conditions that have recently caused global credit and other financial markets to experience substantial volatility and disruption persist or worsen  certain financial institutions may become insolvent or further tighten their lending standards  which could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost effective financing for our investments 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to extend the maturity of our repurchase agreements as a mechanism to reduce the interest rate risk of the securities portfolio 
at december   we had million in notional interest rate swaps outstanding 
should market rates for similar term interest rate swaps drop below the minimum rates we have agreed to on our interest rate swaps  we will be required to post additional margin to the swap counterparty  reducing available liquidity 
at december  the company pledged million in cash margin to cover decreased valuation of the interest rate swaps 
the weighted average maturity of the swaps was years at december  our inability to sell approximately million  net of lower of cost or market adjustment  of mortgage loans we own could adversely affect our profitability as any sale for less than the current valuation would result in a loss 
currently  these loans are not financed or pledged 
as it relates to loans sold previously under certain loan sale agreements by our discontinued mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
while in the past we complied with the repurchase demands by repurchasing the loan with cash and reselling it at a loss  thus reducing our cash position  more recently we have addressed these requests by negotiating a net cash settlement based on the actual or assumed loss on the loan in lieu of repurchasing the loans 
the company periodically receives repurchase requests  each of which management reviews to determine  based on management s experience  whether such request may reasonably be deemed to have merit 
as of december   we had a total of million of unresolved repurchase requests that management concluded may reasonably be deemed to have merit  against which we had a reserve of approximately million 
in addition  we may be subject to new repurchase requests from investors with whom we have not settled or with respect to repurchase obligations not covered under the settlement 
we paid quarterly cash dividends of  and per common share in may  july  and october  respectively 
on december   we declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of per common share to common stockholders of record january   which was paid on january  on january   we paid a per share cash dividend  or approximately million in the aggregate  on shares of our series a preferred stock to holders of record as of december  we also paid a per share cash dividend on shares of our series a preferred stock during each of the first  second and third quarters of each of these dividends was paid out of the company s working capital and recorded as interest expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations as the series a preferred stock is reported as debt per sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
we will continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter and will make adjustments as necessary  based on a variety of factors  including  among other things  the need to maintain our reit status  our financial condition  liquidity  earnings projections and business prospects 
our dividend policy does not constitute an obligation to pay dividends  which only occurs when our board of directors declares a dividend 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the various requirements to maintain our reit status and to minimize or avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of reit taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 

table of contents certain of our assets may generate substantial mismatches between reit taxable income and available cash 
these assets could include mortgage backed securities we hold that have been issued at a discount and require the accrual of taxable income in advance of the receipt of cash 
as a result  our reit taxable income may exceed our cash available for distribution and the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our net taxable income could cause us to sell assets in adverse market conditions  borrow on unfavorable terms  distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in assets or repayment of debt  in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements 
inflation for the periods presented herein  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
the impact of inflation is primarily reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
virtually all our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
our consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates typically increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
during periods of increasing interest rates  demand for mortgages and a borrower s ability to qualify for mortgage financing in a purchase transaction may be adversely affected 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  borrowers may prepay their mortgages  which in turn may adversely affect our yield and subsequently the value of our portfolio of mortgage assets 
contractual obligations and commitments the company had the following contractual obligations at december  amounts in thousands total less than year to years to years after years operating leases repurchase agreements collateralized debt obligations subordinated debentures convertible preferred debentures interest rate swaps management fees employment agreements amounts include interest paid during the period 
interest based on interest rates in effect on december  maturities of our cdos are dependent upon cash flows received from the underlying loans receivable 
our estimate of their repayment is based on scheduled principal payments and estimated principal prepayments based on our internal prepayment model on the underlying loans receivable 
this estimate will differ from actual amounts to the extent prepayments and or loan losses are experienced

amounts due with respect to the advisory fee are subject to adjustment based on the equity capital of the managed subsidiaries and any incentive compensation due pursuant to the advisory agreement between the managed subsidiaries and hcs 
see item business our relationship with hcs and the advisory agreement advisory agreement above for a summary of the material terms of the advisory agreement 

table of contents advisory agreement on january   we entered into an advisory agreement with hcs  pursuant to which hcs will advise  manage and make investments on behalf of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
pursuant to the advisory agreement  hcs is entitled to receive the following compensation base advisory fee equal to per annum of the equity capital as defined in item of this annual report of the managed subsidiaries is payable by us to hcs in cash  quarterly in arrears  and incentive compensation equal to of the gaap net income of the managed subsidiaries attributable to the investments that are managed by hcs that exceed a hurdle rate equal to the greater of a and b plus the ten year treasury rate for such fiscal year will be payable by us to hcs in cash  quarterly in arrears  provided  however  that a portion of the incentive compensation may be paid in shares of our common stock 
if we terminate the advisory agreement other than for cause or elect not to renew it  we will be required to pay hcs a cash termination fee equal to the sum of i the average annual base advisory fee and ii the average annual incentive compensation earned during the month period immediately preceding the date of termination 
significance of estimates and critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  many of which require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates are based  in part  on our judgment and assumptions regarding various economic conditions that we believe are reasonable based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of reporting 
the results of these estimates affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income  expenses and other comprehensive income during the periods presented 
changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on these financial statements 
accounting policies and estimates related to specific components of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and which require complex management judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
interest income on our residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities is a combination of the interest earned based on the outstanding principal balance of the underlying loan security  the contractual terms of the assets and the amortization of yield adjustments  principally premiums and discounts  using generally accepted interest methods 
the net gaap cost over the par balance of self originated loans held for investment and premium and discount associated with the purchase of mortgage backed securities and loans are amortized into interest income over the lives of the underlying assets using the effective yield method as adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments 
estimating prepayments and the remaining term of our interest yield investments require management judgment  which involves  among other things  consideration of possible future interest rate environments and an estimate of how borrowers will react to those environments  historical trends and performance 
the actual prepayment speed and actual lives could be more or less than the amount estimated by management at the time of origination or purchase of the assets or at each financial reporting period 

table of contents fair value 
the company adopted sfas no  fair value measurements  effective january   and accordingly all assets and liabilities measured at fair value will utilize valuation methodologies in accordance with the statement 
the company has established and documented processes for determining fair values 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices  where available 
if listed prices or quotes are not available  then fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use inputs that are market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the three levels of valuation hierarchy established by fas are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
the following describes the valuation methodologies used for the company s financial instruments measured at fair value  as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 
a 
investment securities available for sale fair value is generally based on quoted prices provided by dealers who make markets in similar financial instruments 
the dealers will incorporate common market pricing methods  including a spread measurement to the treasury curve or interest rate swap cure as well as underlying characteristics of the particular security including coupon  periodic and life caps  collateral type  rate reset period and seasoning or age of the security 
if the fair value of a security is not reasonably available from a dealer  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security that the company receives from the issuer and based on available market information 
management reviews all prices used in determining valuation to ensure they represent current market conditions 
this review includes surveying similar market transactions  comparisons to interest pricing models as well as offerings of like securities by dealers 
the company s investment securities are valued based upon readily observable market parameters and are classified as level fair values 
impairment of and basis adjustments on securitized financial assets as previously described herein  during and early  we regularly securitized our mortgage loans and retained the beneficial interests created by such securitization 
such assets are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis or  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets or the underlying collateral may be impaired  on a more frequent basis 
we evaluate whether these assets are considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary and  if the impairment is other than temporary  recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the asset s amortized cost basis and its fair value 
these evaluations require management to make estimates and judgments based on changes in market interest rates  credit ratings  credit and delinquency data and other information to determine whether unrealized losses are reflective of credit deterioration and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity or recovery 
this other than temporary impairment analysis requires significant management judgment and we deem this to be a critical accounting estimate 
as of december   our principal investment portfolio included approximately million of agency cmo floaters 
following a review of our principal investment portfolio  we determined in march that the agency cmo floaters held in our portfolio were no longer producing acceptable returns and initiated a program to dispose of these securities on an opportunistic basis 
as of march   the company had sold approximately million in current par value of agency cmo floaters under this program resulting in a net gain of approximately million 
as a result of these sales and our intent to sell the remaining agency cmo floaters in our principal investment portfolio  we concluded the reduction in value at december  was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of million for the quarter and year ended december  in addition  we also determined that million in current par value of non agency rmbs  which includes million in current par value of retained residual interest  had suffered an other than temporary impairment and  accordingly  recorded an impairment charge of million for the quarter and year ended december  b 
interest rate swaps and caps the fair value of interest rate swaps and caps are based on using market accepted financial models as well as dealer quotes 
the model utilizes readily observable market parameters  including treasury rates  interest rate swap spreads and swaption volatility curves 
the company s interest rate caps and swaps are classified as level fair values 

table of contents c 
mortgage loans held for sale net the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale net are estimated by the company based on the price that would be received if the loans were sold as whole loans taking into consideration the aggregated characteristics of the loans such as  but not limited to  collateral type  index  interest rate  margin  length of fixed interest rate period  life cap  periodic cap  underwriting standards  age and credit 
as there are not readily available quoted prices for identical or similar loans are classified as level fair values

the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion used in earlier definitions of fair value 
sfas no 
clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability  that is  the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
sfas no 
provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
in addition  sfas no 
provides a framework for measuring fair value  and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date the company has disclosed the required elements of sfas no 
herein at note on january   the company adopted sfas no  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value

sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements and requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
sfas no 
also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet

on january   the fasb issued eitf no 
 amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf to achieve more consistent determination of whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred for all beneficial interest within the scope of eitf eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december   on a prospective basis 
eitf eliminates the requirement that a holder s best estimate of cash flows be based upon those that a market participant would use and instead requires that an other than temporary impairment be recognized as a realized loss through earnings when it its probable there has been an adverse change in the holder s estimated cash flows from cash flows previously projected 
this change is consistent with the impairment models contained in sfas no 
eitf no 
emphasizes that the holder must consider all available information relevant to the collectibility of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows 
such information generally should include the remaining payment terms of the security  prepayments speeds  financial condition of the issuer  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
the holder should also consider industry analyst reports and forecasts  sector credit ratings  and other market data that are relevant to the collectibility of the security 
the company s adoption of eitf at december  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

all of our portfolio interest market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are managed with a long term perspective and are not for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is measured by the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows  especially the speed at which prepayments occur on our residential mortgage related assets 
changes in interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our borrowings 
our cmo floater assets have interest rates that adjust monthly  at a margin over libor  as do the repurchase agreement liabilities that we use to finance those cmo assets 
our adjustable rate hybrid arm assets reset on various dates that are not matched to the reset dates on our repurchase agreements 
in general  the repricing of our repurchase agreements occurs more quickly than the repricing of our assets 
first  our floating rate borrowings may react to changes in interest rates before our adjustable rate assets because the weighted average next re pricing dates on the related borrowings may have shorter time periods than that of the adjustable rate assets 
second  interest rates on adjustable rate assets may be limited to a periodic cap or an increase of typically or per adjustment period  while our borrowings do not have comparable limitations 
third  our adjustable rate assets typically lag changes in the applicable interest rate indices by days due to the notice period provided to adjustable rate borrowers when the interest rates on their loans are scheduled to change 
we seek to manage interest rate risk in the portfolio by utilizing interest rate swaps  caps and eurodollar futures  with the goal of optimizing the earnings potential while seeking to maintain long term stable portfolio values 
we continually monitor the duration of our mortgage assets and have a policy to hedge the financing such that the net duration of the assets  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments  are less than one year 

table of contents interest rates can also affect our net return on hybrid arm securities and loans net of the cost of financing hybrid arms 
we continually monitor and estimate the duration of our hybrid arms and have a policy to hedge the financing of the hybrid arms such that the net duration of the hybrid arms  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments are less than one year 
during a declining interest rate environment  the prepayment of hybrid arms may accelerate as borrowers may opt to refinance at a lower rate causing the amount of liabilities that have been extended by the use of interest rate swaps to increase relative to the amount of hybrid arms  possibly resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arms as replacement hybrid arms may have a lower yield than those being prepaid 
conversely  during an increasing interest rate environment  hybrid arms may prepay slower than expected  requiring us to finance a higher amount of hybrid arms than originally forecast and at a time when interest rates may be higher  resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arms 
our exposure to changes in the prepayment speed of hybrid arms is mitigated by regular monitoring of the outstanding balance of hybrid arms  and adjusting the amounts anticipated to be outstanding in future periods and  on a regular basis  making adjustments to the amount of our fixed rate borrowing obligations for future periods 
we utilize a model based risk analysis system to assist in projecting portfolio performances over a scenario of different interest rates 
the model incorporates shifts in interest rates  changes in prepayments and other factors impacting the valuations of our financial securities  including mortgage backed securities  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
based on the results of the model  as of december   changes in interest rates would have the following effect on net interest income dollar amounts in thousands changes in net interest income changes in interest rates changes in net interest income interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our mortgage assets and related hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our mortgage assets decreases and as interest rates decrease  the value of such investments will increase 
in general  we would expect however that  over time  decreases in value of our portfolio attributable to interest rate changes will be offset  to the degree we are hedged  by increases in value of our interest rate swaps  and vice versa 
however  the relationship between spreads on securities and spreads on swaps may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decline 
however  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a security or loan  changes in the book value of our portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to make a distribution to our stockholders 
liquidity risk liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available to operate our business 
it is our policy to have adequate liquidity at all times 
we plan to meet liquidity through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
our principal sources of liquidity are the repurchase agreements on our rmbs  the cdos we have issued to finance our loans held in securitization trust  the principal and interest payments from mortgage assets and cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities 
we believe our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
as it relates to our investment portfolio  derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk subject us to margin call risk 
if the value of our pledged assets decrease  due to a change in interest rates  credit characteristics  or other pricing factors  we may be required to post additional cash or asset collateral  or reduce the amount we are able to borrower versus the collateral 
under our interest rate swaps typically we pay a fixed rate to the counterparties while they pay us a floating rate 
if interest rates drop below the rate we are paying on an interest rate swap  we may be required to post cash margin 

table of contents prepayment risk when borrowers repay the principal on their mortgage loans before maturity or faster than their scheduled amortization  the effect is to shorten the period over which interest is earned  and therefore  reduce the yield for mortgage assets purchased at a premium to their then current balance  as with the majority of our assets 
conversely  mortgage assets purchased for less than their then current balance exhibit higher yields due to faster prepayments 
furthermore  prepayment speeds exceeding or lower than our modeled prepayment speeds impact the effectiveness of any hedges we have in place to mitigate financing and or fair value risk 
generally  when market interest rates decline  borrowers have a tendency to refinance their mortgages  thereby increasing prepayments 
our prepayment model will help determine the amount of hedging we use to off set changes in interest rates 
if actual prepayment rates are higher than modeled  the yield will be less than modeled in cases where we paid a premium for the particular mortgage asset 
conversely  when we have paid a premium  if actual prepayment rates experienced are slower than modeled  we would amortize the premium over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
in an increasing prepayment environment  the timing difference between the actual cash receipt of principal paydowns and the announcement of the principal paydown may result in additional margin requirements from our repurchase agreement counterparties 
we mitigate prepayment risk by constantly evaluating our mortgage assets relative to prepayment speeds observed for assets with a similar structure  quality and characteristics 
furthermore  we stress test the portfolio as to prepayment speeds and interest rate risk in order to further develop or make modifications to our hedge balances 
historically we have not hedged of our liability costs due to prepayment risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk that we will not fully collect the principal we have invested in mortgage loans or securities due to either borrower defaults  or a counterparty failure 
our portfolio as of december  consisted of approximately million of securitized first liens originated in and earlier  approximately million of agency rmbs backed by the credit of fannie mae or freddie mac  approximately million of non agency floating rate securities rated aaa by both standard and poor s and moody s 
in addition we own approximately million of loans held for sale in hc  net of lower or cost or market locom adjustment 
the securitized first liens were principally originated by our subsidiary hc prior to our exit from the mortgage lending business 
these are predominately high quality loans with average loan to value ltv ratio at origination of approximately  and average borrower credit score of approximately in addition approximately of these loans were originated with full income and asset verification 
while we feel that our origination and underwriting of these loans will help to mitigate the risk of significant borrower defaults  on these loans  we cannot assure you that all borrowers will continue to satisfy their payment obligations under these loans  thereby avoiding default 
the million of mortgage loans held in securitization trusts are permanently financed with million of collateralized debt obligations leaving the company with a net exposure of million of credit exposure  which represents the company s equity interest in the cdo s 

table of contents market fair value risk changes in interest rates also expose us to market risk that the market value fair value on our assets may decline 
for certain of the financial instruments that we own  fair values will not be readily available since there are no active trading markets for these instruments as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  fair values can only be derived or estimated for these investments using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently subjective and imprecise 
minor changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these derived or estimated fair values 
these estimates and assumptions are indicative of the interest rate environments as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
we note that the values of our investments in mortgage backed securities and in derivative instruments  primarily interest rate hedges on our debt  will be sensitive to changes in market interest rates  interest rate spreads  credit spreads and other market factors 
the value of these investments can vary and has varied materially from period to period 
historically  the values of our mortgage loan portfolio have tended to vary inversely with those of its derivative instruments 
the following describes the methods and assumptions we use in estimating fair values of our financial instruments fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimate of future cashflows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies 
the fair values of the company s residential mortgage backed securities are generally based on market prices provided by five to seven dealers who make markets in these financial instruments 
if the fair value of a security is not reasonably available from a dealer  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security that the company receives from the issuer and on available market information 
the fair value of mortgage loans held for in securitization trusts are determined by the loan pricing sheet which is based third party loan origination entities in similar products and markets 
the market risk management discussion and the amounts estimated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements that assume that certain market conditions occur 
actual results may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in our portfolio assets and borrowings mix and due to developments in the domestic and global financial and real estate markets 
developments in the financial markets include the likelihood of changing interest rates and the relationship of various interest rates and their impact on our portfolio yield  cost of funds and cash flows 
the analytical methods that we use to assess and mitigate these market risks should not be considered projections of future events or operating performance 
as a financial institution that has only invested in us dollar denominated instruments  primarily residential mortgage instruments  and has only borrowed money in the domestic market  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
rather  our market risk exposure is largely due to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk impacts our interest income  interest expense and the market value on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
the management of interest rate risk attempts to maximize earnings and to preserve capital by minimizing the negative impacts of changing market rates  asset and liability mix  and prepayment activity 

table of contents the table below presents the sensitivity of the market value and net duration changes of our portfolio as of december   using a discounted cash flow simulation model 
application of this method results in an estimation of the fair market value change of our assets  liabilities and hedging instruments per basis point bp shift in interest rates 
the use of hedging instruments is a critical part of our interest rate risk management strategies  and the effects of these hedging instruments on the market value of the portfolio are reflected in the model s output 
this analysis also takes into consideration the value of options embedded in our mortgage assets including constraints on the re pricing of the interest rate of assets resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features  as well as prepayment options 
assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive such as cash  payment receivables  prepaid expenses  payables and accrued expenses are excluded 
changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  volatility  mortgage and financing spreads  prepayment behavior  defaults  as well as the timing and level of interest rate changes will affect the results of the model 
therefore  actual results are likely to vary from modeled results 
market value changes changes in interest rates changes in market value net duration amount in thousands years years base years years it should be noted that the model is used as a tool to identify potential risk in a changing interest rate environment but does not include any changes in portfolio composition  financing strategies  market spreads or changes in overall market liquidity 
based on the assumptions used  the model output suggests a very low degree of portfolio price change given increases in interest rates  which implies that our cash flow and earning characteristics should be relatively stable for comparable changes in interest rates 
although market value sensitivity analysis is widely accepted in identifying interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration changes that may occur such as  but not limited to  changes in investment and financing strategies  changes in market spreads and changes in business volumes 
accordingly  we make extensive use of an earnings simulation model to further analyze our level of interest rate risk 
there are a number of key assumptions in our earnings simulation model 
these key assumptions include changes in market conditions that affect interest rates  the pricing of arm products  the availability of investment assets and the availability and the cost of financing for portfolio assets 
other key assumptions made in using the simulation model include prepayment speeds and management s investment  financing and hedging strategies  and the issuance of new equity 
we typically run the simulation model under a variety of hypothetical business scenarios that may include different interest rate scenarios  different investment strategies  different prepayment possibilities and other scenarios that provide us with a range of possible earnings outcomes in order to assess potential interest rate risk 
the assumptions used represent our estimate of the likely effect of changes in interest rates and do not necessarily reflect actual results 
the earnings simulation model takes into account periodic and lifetime caps embedded in our assets in determining the earnings at risk
