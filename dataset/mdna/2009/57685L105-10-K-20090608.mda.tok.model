item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company develops  markets and sells innovative  over the counter otc healthcare products with an emphasis on those that utilize unique  novel and or proprietary delivery systems that provide consumers with better ways to get better 
the company currently markets its products within the billion overall cough and cold category at retail 
our zicam products are sold in the cold remedy nasal delivery and oral delivery  allergy sinus nasal delivery  cough cough spray and multi symptom relief oral delivery market groups of the overall cough and cold category 
our nasal comfort products have been sold within the space allocated for allergy sinus products at retail 
the zicam cold sore and healthy z ssentials products are also part of the cough cold category 
we expect that our mix of products sold will change due to seasonality and varying growth rates within each group 
most of our core products are currently available at all of the major food  drug  and mass merchant retailers 

table of contents the following table details our sales by product class  for the periods indicated  with further details below months ended months ended months ended march  march  december  product class cold remedy allergy sinus cough multi symptom other cough cold canada antacid total net sales because of the extreme seasonality of our business  our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year in order to better align our operations and financial results with the entire cold season our previous fiscal years ended december  which is the middle of the cold season 
due to the change in our fiscal year  results for the three months ended march   are reported as a transition period 
our fiscal year now begins april and ends march net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to approximately million  or above net sales of million for the fiscal year ended march  sales growth in fiscal was led by increased sales of our core products cold remedy and allergy sinus 
the increase in net sales is attributable to a increase in sales of our cold remedy products  driven by a increase in sales of cold remedy swabs 
in addition  sales of our zicam allergy sinus products increased  primarily due to sales of allergy swabs 
sales in canada accounted for approximately million  while healthy z ssentials and cold sore accounted for million of net sales 
cough and multi symptom sales declined million 
net income for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million compared to approximately for the year ended march  the increase in net income is due to higher net sales  partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative sg a 
we expect net income loss in future periods to be significantly affected by the level of sales  severity of the cold and flu season  the timing and amount of our advertising  research and development expenses  and the timing and amount of expenses incurred in litigation matters 
expenditures for advertising and research and development will vary by quarter throughout the year and could be significantly different in future periods than the amounts incurred in the same period in earlier years 
we expect that advertising expenses will be highest during the cold season third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we anticipate quarterly earnings will continue to vary along with the seasonality of sales and the level of marketing and research and development expense 
as in prior years  we expect to report a loss in the quarter ending june our fiscal first quarter 
the company s management reviews several key indicators in evaluating overall performance we compare our year to date sales and net income performance against our stated annual goal for each 
for fiscal  our goal was to grow sales to above the million recorded for the fiscal year ended march  resulting in revenue in the range of million million  and to increase net income to above the million realized in fiscal resulting in net income in the range of million million 
for fiscal  net sales increased compared to the prior year  and net income increased 
barring additional changes in the economic environment  we expect the zicam brand will continue to grow as we market our products and we achieve increased consumer awareness of our products 
we monitor our share of the cough and cold market because increased consumer purchases of our products are an indicator of growth 
for the weeks ended march   retail unit sales of our products as measured by three outlet syndicated scanner data  not including wal mart and club stores decreased approximately over the comparable period in the previous year  while unit sales in the entire cough and cold category decreased approximately over the same period 

table of contents we measure our ability to maintain strong gross margins on our products 
during the year ended march   we realized an average gross margin of  compared to the average gross margin achieved in the year ended march  gross margins on our existing products vary between and 
average gross margins in fiscal improved due to a more favorable mix of higher margin products sold during the year  a previously implemented price increase on certain cold remedy and allergy sinus products  and cost reductions achieved on several of our products 
in addition  gross margin in fiscal year was impacted by a million increase to the returns reserve in excess of our customary of gross sales 
we evaluate our operating performance by reviewing  over time  our ability to decrease selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
we evaluate our ability to reduce sg a expense on an annual basis due to the seasonal fluctuations in quarterly net sales 
for the year ended march   our sg a expenses which do not include r d expenses were approximately of net sales  compared to for the year ended march  sg a expense for fiscal includes million of recall related charges 
we review the distribution and mix of our products by key national retailers 
our ten largest retail customers account for approximately of our annual sales  and we encourage our largest customers to carry a mix of our highest selling products 
retailers generally reset their cough and cold sections during the third calendar quarter of each year  at which time they add or discontinue products 
our ten largest retailers increased the net number of zicam products that they carried for the cold season 
seasonality and quarterly results the products we currently market are seasonal in nature  and sales at retail generally increase as the level of population suffering from colds rises 
the company records sales when we ship products from our warehouse facilities 
during the second fiscal quarter  the company usually realizes increased sales volume as retailers stock our products and order displays to prepare for the upcoming cough and cold season 
additional sales reorders to retailers are highly dependent upon the incidence of illness within the population 
retail consumption of our products is highest during the cough and cold season  which usually runs from october through march 
the company begins extensive advertising campaigns to coincide with the cough and cold season and generally realizes higher advertising expense in the october through march timeframe 
the fiscal first quarter ending june of each year generally accounts for only to of annual sales and  historically  we have incurred a loss in that quarter 
in addition  the company records the expense for annual bonus awards when goal attainment for the bonus is probable or has been achieved 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any single quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition  accounting for sales returns and allowances  accounting for sales discounts and promotional programs  and accounting for legal contingencies 
intangible assets and goodwill we recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the acquisition of the zicam  llc interest acquired from zensano  inc in december under sfas no 
 goodwill must be tested upon a triggering event or at least annually to identify a potential impairment and the amount of any impairment loss 
factors that could affect this analysis would be significant loss of market share  a general decline in zicam product sales  higher than expected increases in expenses and various other matters 
any change in key assumptions about the business or prospects of zicam  llc  or any change in market conditions or other externalities affecting zicam  llc  could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our annual valuation of goodwill as of september  was completed in january and no impairment was identified 
no triggering events have occurred subsequent to the valuation 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record income tax expense based on our estimated effective income tax rate for the year and will continue to do so in future periods 
in fiscal and the three months ended march   we recognized a tax benefit related to the charitable donation of products 
in fiscal  we fully utilized the tax loss carryforward from prior years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product to retailers 
sales incentives  promotional allowances  and returns are estimated and recognized at the date of shipment based upon historical activity and current agreements with customers 
the company evaluates these estimates on a quarterly basis and revises them as necessary 

table of contents customer sales returns and allowances the estimate for product returns reflects our historical experience of sales to retailers and is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects potential product returns 
we record a returns provision of of gross sales for all of our products 
we review the return provision at least quarterly and adjust the reserve amounts if actual product returns differ materially from our reserve percentage 
additionally  we adjust the returns provision when a determination is made that a product will be discontinued  either in whole or by certain retailers 
should the actual level of product returns vary significantly from our estimates  our operating and financial results would be materially affected 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded a million increase to our returns reserve  in excess of the customary of gross sales  for anticipated returns expected in connection with retailers announced discontinuation of certain products 
during the fiscal year ended march   we experienced product returns associated with discontinued items and we recorded a million adjustment to our returns provision  in excess of our customary of gross sales  to account for the increased returns of discontinued products which included several of our cough and flu products 
additionally  during calendar  we recorded a million adjustment to our returns provision to account for increased returns of nasal comfort and discontinued products from a large customer 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable 
the allowance is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects the amount of the company s probable credit losses 
effective april   the company elected to reduce its accrual rate from of gross sales to of gross sales  based on historical performance 
during our review in the fiscal quarter ended september   we determined that our allowance for bad debt exceeded the amount of loss that would likely be incurred and we reduced the allowance amount by approximately  this reduction was reflected in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended march  legal contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of our business 
see part i  item legal proceedings for information regarding our pending and threatened litigation and our reserves for product liability litigation 
while we are vigorously defending the company in these proceedings  the outcome of these and any other proceedings that may arise cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company follows the guidance of sfas  accounting for contingencies  which states that the company is required to accrue a contingent loss when the loss is deemed probable and reasonably estimable

in addition  the company occasionally provides deposits and prepayments to our manufacturers to improve and increase manufacturing capabilities for our products 
the company s facility lease for its corporate offices expired during fiscal and we leased new corporate office and r d space in march the relocation required capital expenditures and tenant improvements of approximately  which are being amortized over the term of the new lease approximately five years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to our variable rate revolving line of credit with comerica bank 
at no time during the year ended march  did we have any outstanding borrowings on this line of credit 
consequently  we believe that moderate interest rate increases and the current uncertainties regarding available credit will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position in the foreseeable future 
as of march  and march   we did not participate in any financial market risk sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases or commodity price risk 
during fiscal we initiated international sales in canada  which accounted for approximately million of our net sales in fiscal we contracted with a canadian distributor to conduct sales and manage retail relationships in canada 
we ship products to the distributor who then sells our products directly to retailers in canada 
our exposure to currency exchange risk is minimal due to the advance agreement of exchange rate terms with the distributor 
however  should exchange rates us dollar to canadian dollar fluctuate significantly in the future  our net sales price per unit in canada may vary at a similar rate 
we will continue to evaluate whether we will be subject to currency exchange risk in any material way 
we do not anticipate using derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
if the volume of international business grows  we will assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk
