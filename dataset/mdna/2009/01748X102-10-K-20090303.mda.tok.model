item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of december  and you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the section entitled special note about forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview who we are 
we are a leisure travel company 
the focus of our business is a low cost passenger airline marketed to leisure travelers in small cities 
our business model emphasizes low operating costs  diversified revenue sources  and the transport of passengers from small cities to leisure destinations 
our route network  pricing philosophy  product offering and advertising are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services from us 
we provide service primarily to las vegas nevada  phoenix arizona  orlando florida  tampa st 
petersburg florida and ft 
lauderdale florida  five of the most popular leisure destinations in the united states 
we have announced we will start service in the second quarter of to our sixth leisure destination  los angeles  california 
our fleet 
the following table sets forth the number and type of aircraft in service and operated by us at the dates indicated december  december  december  own a b lease total own a lease total own a lease total md s mds total a aircraft owned includes aircraft subject to capital leases as follows december   december   december  b does not include five owned md aircraft 
of these five aircraft  we have taken possession of two aircraft previously leased to a third party which we expect to place into service before the end of the first quarter of three aircraft remain leased to a third party 
our markets 
our scheduled service consists of limited frequency nonstop flights into leisure destinations from small cities 
as of december   we offered scheduled service from small cities primarily into las vegas  phoenix  orlando  tampa st 
petersburg  and ft 
lauderdale  including seasonal service  and additional service to other leisure destinations from bellingham washington 
the following shows the number of destinations and small cities served as of the dates indicated as of december  major leisure destinations other leisure destinations small cities total cities served 
table of contents our fiscal year 
we operate on a calendar year ending on the last day in december 
for convenience  we refer to the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  as  and  respectively 
our operating revenue our operating revenue comprises both air travel on a stand alone basis and bundled with hotels  rental cars and other travel related services 
we believe our diversified revenue streams distinguish us from other us airlines and other travel companies 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue consists of air fare for nonstop flights between our small cities and leisure destinations 
fixed fee contract revenue 
our fixed fee contract revenue consists largely of fixed flying agreements with affiliates of harrah s entertainment inc that provide for a predictable revenue stream 
we also provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis to several customers 
ancillary revenue 
our ancillary revenue is generated from the sale of hotel rooms  rental cars  advance seat assignments  checked bag charges  in flight products and other items sold in conjunction with our scheduled air service 
we recognize our ancillary revenues net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees 
other revenue 
other revenue is generated from aircraft and flight equipment leased to third parties 
seasonality 
our business is seasonal in nature with traffic demand historically being weaker in the third quarter and stronger in the first quarter 
our operating revenue is largely driven by perceived product value  advertising and promotional activities and can be adversely impacted during periods with reduced leisure travel spending  such as the back to school season 
our operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expense line items follows 
our cost structure is highly variable as we consider our fixed costs to have represented only of our operating expense per available seat mile casm in  or of our operating expenses 
aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of aircraft fuel  fuel taxes  into plane fees and airport fuel flowage  storage or through put fees 
under certain fixed fee flying agreements  we have been reimbursed by our customers if fuel exceeds a pre determined cost per gallon  and these reimbursements are netted against fuel expense 
as of january  we are under a new fixed fee flying agreement with harrah s which provides reimbursement for the entire amount of incurred fuel costs 
as a result  the amount of revenue to be recognized under this agreement and our fuel expense will be reduced as the amount to be paid by harrah s for fuel cost will be netted against our fuel expense rather than constituting a part of the revenue we would have otherwise recognized under the fixed fee contract 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense includes wages  salaries  and employee bonuses  sales commissions for in flight personnel  as well as expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes 
station operations expense 
station operations expense includes the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities and fees charged by third party vendors for ground handling services and commissary expenses 

table of contents maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense includes all parts  materials and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
also included are fees for repairs performed by third party vendors 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense includes all advertising  promotional expenses  travel agent commissions  and credit card discount fees associated with the sale of scheduled service 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense consists of the cost of leasing aircraft under operating leases with third parties 
also included are maintenance reserves when not considered part of maintenance and repair expense as discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates below 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft that we own  and amortization of aircraft that we operate under capital leases 
other expense 
other expense includes the cost of passenger liability insurance  aircraft hull insurance  and all other insurance policies except for employee welfare insurance 
additionally  this expense includes travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel  facility lease expenses  professional fees  personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above 
trends and uncertainties affecting our business we believe our financial success is driven by variable factors that affect airlines and their markets  and by trends affecting the travel industry 
the following discussion describes certain key factors we believe may affect our future performance 
economic conditions the us economy  impacted by the ongoing credit crisis  continues to suffer from extreme negative conditions 
these conditions have created a challenging environment for the airline industry 
an uncertainty exists for airline travel demand given tightening of consumer spending 
in the near term  the recent reduction in fuel prices is expected to more than offset the impact of a lower average air fare and uncertain airline travel demand in this current economic environment 
capacity management in response to rising fuel prices in  we focused on appropriate capacity reductions to ensure continued profitability 
our route adjustments reflected long haul route eliminations and frequency reductions  along with new short haul routes that together drove lower average stage length for the period 
another focus was to increase passenger loads  which was reflected in greater than load factors during most months in together  these measures resulted in significantly lower fuel consumption per passenger  while higher passenger loads helped drive larger ancillary revenues 
despite the state of the economy  we believe there is sufficient demand to allow us to restore some capacity from these reductions made in  and to further expand our route network including initiation in second quarter of scheduled service to our sixth major leisure destination  los angeles 
demographics and consumer behavior the airline industry is influenced by lifestyle and demographic trends  and the performance of the broader us economy 
we believe the current demographic and lifestyle trends are positive drivers of 
table of contents the leisure travel industry 
the aging of the baby boomers as they enter their peak earning years with more disposable income has had a positive impact on growing consumer demand for leisure travel generally 
we believe the small cities we serve have not been impacted from the current negative conditions in the economy as much as many of the major cities in the country 
in addition  we believe we have a diversified consumer base in our leisure destinations in florida and phoenix where we are generating increased travel originating from our leisure destinations 
aircraft fuel the airline industry is heavily dependent on the use of jet fuel and fuel costs represent a significant portion of the total operating expenses for airlines 
recently  fuel prices have been subject to extreme price fluctuations 
in the third quarter of  our average cost per gallon was compared to for the fourth quarter of fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for heating oil  gasoline and other petroleum products 
the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty and further fuel cost volatility could significantly affect our future results of operations 
labor the airline industry is heavily unionized and the wages and benefits of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements 
conflicts between unionized airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages 
we currently have a non unionized work force and are not subject to collective bargaining agreements at the present time 
our pilots and flight attendants have formed in house associations to negotiate matters of concern with us 
further attempts are possible to unionize our flight attendants as the waiting period required by the national mediation board nmb has elapsed since the prior rejection of union representation in december if our employees were to unionize in the future and we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement  or we were to experience wide spread employee dissatisfaction  we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages 
in addition  we may be subject to disruption by organized labor groups protesting our non union status 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on our future results 
competition the airline industry is highly competitive 
passenger demand and fare levels have historically been influenced by  among other things  industry capacity and pricing actions taken by other airlines 
the principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing  customer service  routes served  flight schedules  types of aircraft  safety record and reputation  code sharing relationships  and frequent flyer programs 

table of contents results of operations the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the last three fiscal years 
operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses compared to we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million for by comparison  in  we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million 
operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in due to increases in scheduled service  fixed fee contract  ancillary and other revenue 
the increase in operating revenue outpaced a increase in total system passengers  indicating our success in increasing revenue per passenger from to the increase in system passengers was in turn driven by a increase in system departures and an increase in system load factor from to 
system available seat miles asms increased by a more modest as the increase in departures was offset by a decline in average stage length 
system operating revenue per asm rasm increased by  as we successfully grew revenue  particularly ancillary revenue  faster than capacity in scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million in from million in driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers carried and a reduction in scheduled service air fare per passenger 
scheduled service air fare per passenger declined only despite a reduction in scheduled average stage length from to scheduled service passenger growth was driven by a increase in scheduled service departures and a percentage point increase in scheduled service load factor to 
departure growth in was driven in part by the full year effect of our newly established major leisure destinations of phoenix and ft 
lauderdale in late  as well as service increases in our other bases 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue increased to million in up from million in the substantial increase in fixed fee contract revenue was primarily due to additional flying under a contract with a third harrah s entertainment  inc subsidiary that started in january and under a contract with mlt vacations which began in may and ended in october  neither of which were in place in the prior year 
these new contracts more than offset the loss of revenue from our contract with apple vacations west which ended in april 
table of contents ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger from to 
the increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger was due to the sale of several new products and higher prices charged for certain existing products 
for instance  the adoption of checked baggage fees by almost all of the larger airlines in the united states facilitated the increase in our baggage fees to comparable levels 
other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million during as a result of the purchase of six md aircraft and three engines on lease to another airline early in the year 
two of these aircraft were returned to us under the terms of the lease in the fourth quarter of and one of these was placed in service by the end of the year 
we expect to receive the remaining aircraft and engines under the terms of the lease during we generated other revenue of million in due to the purchase of eight engines on lease to another airline 
we received these engines in the fourth quarter of under the terms of the lease 
while we do not regularly seek to lease aircraft or engines to third parties  the economics of acquiring these particular aircraft and engines close to the end of their existing leases to third parties were attractive 
operating expenses our operating expenses increased by to million in compared to million in we primarily evaluate our expense management by comparing our costs per passenger across different periods which enable us to assess trends in each expense category 
the following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods per passenger costs 
the table also presents operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by the number of passengers carried 
this statistic provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel our per passenger costs increased at a substantially slower pace than our overall expenses due to a increase in the number of system passengers carried in as compared with  significantly above the increase in system departures of 
the following table presents unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm casm  for the indicated periods 
the table also presents operating casm  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by available seat miles 
as on a per passenger basis  excluding fuel on an asm basis provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 

table of contents we do not believe casm is the most appropriate measure by which to evaluate our cost management due to the evolving nature of our route network  our aggressive approach to managing capacity ie  asms on a seasonal basis  and the low utilization of our fleet which results in many of our expenses being more fixed as opposed to varying significantly with our asm production 
we provide this table as a convenience because we recognize that casm is widely used to compare costs in the airline industry 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased to million in  up from million in  driven by a substantial increase in the average cost per gallon to during from in  coupled with a increase in gallons consumed to million from million 
the increase in gallons consumed was in line with the increase in system departures of and the reduction in average stage length of for the year 
we took significant steps to conserve fuel during  including taxi ing with one engine and ensuring flights were flown at more fuel efficient speeds 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in full time equivalent employees to support a increase in our average fleet from during to aircraft during we employed approximately  full time equivalent employees at december   compared to  full time equivalent employees at december  in addition  our monthly average salary and benefit expense per full time equivalent increased to  during compared to  during station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in driven by increased system departures of 
station operations expense per departure increased only in compared to despite much fuller aircraft  as reflected in a percentage point increase in system load factor from in to in the modest increase in station operations expense per departure occurred despite a significant increase in the proportion of fixed fee flying for  which generally has a higher station operations expense per departure 
during  of total system departures were fixed fee flying  compared to during maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased to million in compared to million in the percentage increase in expense greatly exceeded the increase in the average number of aircraft in our fleet from in to in among the main reasons for significantly increased maintenance costs were an increase in repair costs of rotable parts  increased engine maintenance events  and an increase in scheduled heavy maintenance checks from in to in the timing and type of maintenance events may cause our maintenance and repairs expense to vary significantly from period to period and this 
table of contents occurred from to  as each maintenance event that happened to be required during was more costly  on average  than those of sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in  driven primarily by an increase in credit card discount fees associated with the increase in scheduled service and ancillary revenue 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased slightly to million in from million in the average number of aircraft under operating leases during was comparable to the average for in july  we purchased for cash two md aircraft that had been operated under operating leases which reduced the total number of aircraft under operating leases to two as of december  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of  in line with the increase in the number of aircraft owned and subject to capital leases which increased from at december  to at december  the number of aircraft at december  included aircraft on lease to a third party at the time of acquisition 
other expense 
other expense increased by to million in compared to million in due mainly to increased aviation insurance as our fleet increased in size  higher loss from engine dispositions  and increased rent associated with our new company headquarters building 
other income expense other income expense changed from a net other income of million in to a net other expense of million in this change is primarily attributable to two factors a gain on fuel derivatives of million in compared to a minimal loss on our few remaining fuel derivatives in and a reduction in interest income earned on cash balances from million in to million as a result of lower prevailing interest rates 
income tax expense while we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term  it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income 
discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our tax rates 
our effective income tax rate was for compared to in the lower effective tax rate for was largely attributable to the year over year geographic mix of our flying and the impact this had on the state income tax portion of the tax provision 
compared to we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million for by comparison  in  we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million 
as of december   we had a fleet of aircraft with in service compared with a fleet of aircraft with in service as of december  the growth of our fleet enabled a increase in asms for compared to as departures increased by and average stage length decreased by 
scheduled service asms in represented of total asms compared to in as scheduled service asms increased by while fixed fee contract flying asms increased by 

table of contents operating revenue our operating revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in this was driven by a increase in total system rpms and a increase in rasm 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased  or million  to million in from million in due to a increase in scheduled service rpms 
yield increased year over year in due to a shorter scheduled stage length offset by the dilutive effect of introductory pricing on new routes to las vegas  eight new routes to orlando and four new routes to tampa st 
petersburg that started during introductory pricing for routes to our two new leisure destinations of phoenix and ft 
lauderdale in the fourth quarter also impacted yield in the decrease in average stage length coupled with an increase in load factor of percentage points resulted in a increase in scheduled service rasm from to 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue increased  or million  to million in up from million in fixed fee revenues increased principally because of increased flying for harrah s entertainment inc during ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in the increase in ancillary revenue was due to a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per passenger from to due primarily to the introduction of several new products 
other revenue 
lease revenue was generated during of million related to the purchase of eight engines while on lease to another airline 
the engines were returned to us in october with no subsequent lease revenue recognized 
operating expenses our operating expenses increased by  or million  to million in compared to million in the following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table presents our unit costs  defined as casm  for the indicated periods 
in addition  the table presents casm  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel  divided by available seat miles 
this statistic provides management and investors the ability

year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased  or million  to million in up from million in this change was due to a increase in gallons consumed due primarily to a increase in asms and an increase in the average cost per gallon to per gallon during compared to per gallon in salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million in up from million in this increase is largely attributable to a increase in full time equivalent employees to support our growth 
we employed approximately  full time equivalent employees as of december   compared to full time equivalent employees as of december  station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in on a casm basis  station operations has remained flat since the expense increase during was in line with our asm growth 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased by to million in  up from million in the increase in maintenance and repairs expense is largely attributed to the cost from heavy maintenance checks performed during compared to performed in  along with increase in routine line maintenance from the growth of our fleet 
maintenance and repairs casm declined as certain maintenance expenses were spread over a larger base of asms 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million  to million in compared to million in the increase is a result of the advertising and credit card discount fees associated with the increase in scheduled service revenue 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased by to million in from million in on a casm basis  aircraft lease rentals expense decreased to in down from in due to an increase in the percentage of owned versus leased aircraft 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in the increase of was primarily attributable to the number of in service aircraft owned or subject to capital leases which increased from as of december  to as of december   as well as the purchase of rotable parts to support the operating fleet 

table of contents other expense 
other expense increased by to million in compared to million in due mainly to increased aviation insurance  facilities and training expenses associated with our growth  along with additional administrative requirements resulting from being a public company 
other income expense other income expense changed from a net other expense amount of million in to a net other income amount of million in this change is primarily attributable to two factors a loss on fuel derivatives of million in compared to a gain on fuel derivatives of million in and an increase in interest income from million in to million in as a result of increased cash balances 
we recognized a million loss in on the mark to market adjustment for our open fuel derivative contracts and we recognized million in net losses for contracts settled in by contrast  we recognized a million gain in on the mark to market adjustment for our open derivative contracts and we recognized million in net gains for contracts settled in income tax expense income tax expense for was million as our effective income tax rate for the period was 
prior to our reorganization into a corporation at the time of our initial public offering on december   we did not pay corporate federal income tax at the entity level and therefore  we did not incur any federal income tax prior to the initial public offering date 
the income tax expense for was impacted by a million charge to recognize deferred tax liabilities due to the tax reorganization carried out in connection with our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are cash provided by operations and cash provided by financing activities 
our primary uses of cash are for working capital and capital expenditures 
historically  we have been able to fund our short term needs for capital from cash generated from operations 
our long term needs for capital are generally for the purchase of additional aircraft 
to the extent financing is not available on acceptable terms  we would apply our cash assets to the purchase of aircraft 
if we do not have sufficient cash assets available for this purpose at that time  then we would consider leasing aircraft or deferring their acquisition 
current liquidity our total cash  including cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
restricted cash represents credit card deposits  escrowed funds under our fixed fee flying contracts  and cash collateral against letters of credit required by hotel partners for guaranteed room availability  airports and certain other parties 
short term investments represent marketable securities which are available for sale 
during and  our restricted cash balances increased by million and million  respectively  as a result of an increase in the number of letters of credit and increases in the amount of a number of existing letters of credit issued to our hotel vendors and some airports 
under our fixed fee flying contracts  we require our customers to prepay for flights to be provided by us 
the prepayments are escrowed until the flight is completed 
prepayments are recorded as restricted cash and a corresponding amount is recorded as air traffic liability 

table of contents sources and uses of cash operating activities 
during  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million during the cash flows provided by operations during were primarily the result of net income plus non cash depreciation and amortization 
we produced a slightly higher amount of cash from operating activities during as a result of a large increase in passenger bookings for future travel compared to our air traffic liability balance as of the end of the previous year 
passenger bookings for future travel as of december  decreased due to a tighter future booking curve and general economic conditions 
investing activities 
cash used for investing activities in was million compared to million in during  our primary use of cash was for the purchase of property and equipment of million and million for the purchase of available for sale securities  net of maturities 
the purchase of property and equipment during included md aircraft  two of which were previously under operating leases  five of which were previously under capital leases  six aircraft purchased free and clear  and two other aircraft purchased with partial financing 
during  we used cash of million for the purchase of property and equipment and million for the purchase of available for sale securities  net of maturities 
the property and equipment purchases in included an equipment package made up of eight engines and one airframe  and six md aircraft 
two of the aircraft were previously under operating leases  two aircraft were purchased free and clear  and two other aircraft were purchased with partial financing 
financing activities 
during we used million of cash in financing activities compared to million provided by financing activities for the same period of during  we used million to repurchase common stock and million to retire capital lease obligations for five aircraft and make other debt repayments 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million obtained from the financing of ten aircraft 
during  the million in proceeds from a public stock offering more than offset debt and capital lease financing payments made during that year 
debt of the aircraft we own as of december   we had secured debt financing on aircraft  capital lease financing on two aircraft  with the remaining aircraft owned free and clear 
during  we received proceeds of million through the issuance of notes payable on ten aircraft  of which eight were previously owned and debt free 
we also purchased two aircraft through the issuance of notes payable for million during the aircraft we have financed with notes as of december  have an aggregate initial borrowed amount of million and which are scheduled to mature between and the equipment notes bear interest at fixed rates between and with principal and interest payable monthly 
each note is secured by a first mortgage on the aircraft to which it relates 

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual cash obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due in thousands total less than year years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total future payments on contractual obligations long term debt obligations include scheduled interest payments 
operating lease obligations include aircraft operating leases and leases of office space and airport station property 
off balance sheet arrangements we have obligations for aircraft that are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected on our balance sheet 
as of december   two of the aircraft in our fleet were subject to operating leases 
the operating lease terms for these aircraft will expire in we have the option to purchase these aircraft in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
revenue recognition 
scheduled service revenues consist of passenger revenue which is recognized when the travel related service or transportation is provided or when the itinerary expires unused 
nonrefundable scheduled travel itineraries expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer in advance 
itineraries sold  but not yet used  as well as unexpired credits  are included in air traffic liability 
fixed fee contract revenues result from charter service provided under long term agreements and on a seasonal and ad hoc basis 
fixed fee contract revenues are recognized when the transportation is provided 
under certain of our fixed fee contracts  if fuel exceeded a predetermined cost per gallon  reimbursements are received from the customer and netted against fuel expense 
as of january  we are under a new fixed fee flying agreement with harrah s  our largest fixed fee customer  which provides reimbursement for the entire amount of incurred fuel costs 
as a result  the amount of revenue to be recognized under this agreement and our fuel expense will be reduced as the amount to 
table of contents be paid by harrah s for fuel cost will be netted against our fuel expense rather than constituting a part of the revenue we would have otherwise recognized under the fixed fee contract 
ancillary revenues are generated from the sale of hotel rooms and rental cars  advance seat assignments  checked bag charges  in flight products and other items 
revenues from the sale of hotel rooms and rental cars are recognized at the time the room is occupied or the rental car is utilized 
the amount of revenues attributed to each element of a bundled sale involving hotel rooms and rental cars in addition to airfare is determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the sale of hotel rooms  rental cars and certain other ancillary products are recorded net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees and are reported in accordance with eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenues from change fees imposed on passengers for making changes to nonrefundable itineraries are recognized as they occur 
revenues from our travel protection product for unlimited changes to nonrefundable itineraries are recognized at the time of purchase 
other revenue is generated from leased out aircraft and flight equipment 
lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
accounting for long lived assets 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
aircraft maintenance and repair costs 
maintenance and repair costs for flight equipment are accounted for using the direct expense method 
under this method  maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased aircraft  including major overhaul maintenance costs  are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
maintenance deposits paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities are recorded as prepaid maintenance deposits  and then recognized as maintenance expense when the underlying maintenance is performed 
these deposits are calculated based on a performance measure  such as flight hours or cycles  and are available for reimbursement to us upon the completion of the maintenance of the leased aircraft 
if there are sufficient funds on deposit to reimburse us for the invoices initially paid by us for these maintenance events  they are reimbursed to us 
if at any point we determine it is not probable we will recover amounts retained by the lessor through future maintenance events  such amounts are expensed 
the maintenance deposits paid under our lease agreements do not transfer either the obligation to maintain the aircraft or the cost risk associated with the maintenance activities to the aircraft lessor 
in addition  we maintain the right to select any third party maintenance provider 
therefore  we record these amounts as deposits on our balance sheet and then recognize maintenance expense when the underlying maintenance is performed  in accordance with our maintenance accounting policy 
maintenance deposits totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
any amounts that are not probable of being used to fund future maintenance expense would be recognized as additional aircraft lease rentals 

table of contents in determining whether it is probable that maintenance deposits will be used to fund the cost of maintenance events  we conduct the following analysis at the time of delivery of each aircraft under lease  we evaluate the aircraft s condition  including the airframe  the engines  the auxiliary power unit and the landing gear 
future usage of the aircraft is projected during the term of the lease based on our business and fleet plan 
we estimate the cost of performing all required maintenance during the lease term 
these estimates are based on the extensive experience of our management and industry available data  including historical fleet operating statistic reports published by the engine manufacturer  pratt whitney 
we review this asset the maintenance deposits for potential impairment in the preparation of our financial statements 
because there have been no material changes to the estimated cost of expected maintenance events during the remaining term of the leases  no impairment charge was recognized for the years ended december   or fuel derivatives 
we account for fuel derivatives pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
since we have not historically qualified for hedge accounting  unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts at each period end are required to be included in other income expense 
short term investments 
we maintain a liquid portfolio of investments that are available for current operations and to satisfy on going obligations 
we have classified our short term investments as available for sale and accordingly  unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
share based compensation 
we have issued common stock  restricted stock and stock options to executives and employees pursuant to our long term incentive plan and warrants to the placement agent involved in our may issuance of redeemable convertible preferred shares 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment as of january   which requires the recording of stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period using a fair value approach similar to the prior pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
determining the fair value requires judgment  and we use the black scholes valuation model for equity instruments issued 
the most significant judgments required in connection with the use of the black scholes valuation model are the assumptions of volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
we determine these assumptions from a peer group of publicly traded airline companies due to our lack of historical information regarding our own stock price volatility and option exercise behavior 
before our stock was publicly traded  we measured fair value based on a variety of metrics including the share price of a peer group for both publicly traded airline companies and airline stock prices in general  consultation with third parties such as our investment advisors and outside consultants and individual attributes of our company including our then existing financial condition as well as future operating prospects 
in december  we issued  restricted shares under our long term incentive plan which were allocated as of the date of our initial public offering among our employees at the manager level or below 
as required by sfas no 
r  the fair value of the shares at the date of issuance was based on our initial offering price  and is being expensed ratably over the three year vesting period 
the total compensation expense from this restricted share grant will be per share for a total expense of million to be recognized over a three year period 
we have used our closing share price on the grant date as the fair value for all subsequent issuances of restricted stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity prices specifically  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analysis does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel expense for the years ended december  and represented approximately and of our operating expenses  respectively 
increases in fuel prices or a shortage of supply could have a material effect on our operations and operating results 
based on our fuel consumption  a hypothetical ten percent increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel would have increased fuel expense by approximately million for the year ended december  while we do not currently hedge fuel price risk  in the past we entered into 
table of contents forward contracts or other financial products to reduce our exposure to fuel price volatility 
as of december   we had no fuel derivative contracts outstanding 
interest rates we have market risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of our invested cash  which totaled million  and short term investments of million at december  we invest available cash in money market funds  certificates of deposit  investment grade commercial paper  and other highly rated financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned closely parallel short term floating interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates for the years ended december  and  would have affected interest income from cash and investments by million and million  respectively 
our long term debt consists of fixed rate notes payable and capital lease arrangements 
a hypothetical basis point change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
also  a hypothetical basis point change in market rates would not materially impact our earnings or cash flow associated with our fixed rate debt
