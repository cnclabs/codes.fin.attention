item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion and analysis contains certain statements that are not historical facts  including  among others  those relating to our anticipated financial performance for fiscal  cash requirements  and our expected store openings 
such statements are forward looking and speak only as of the date on which they are made 
there are risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in item a of this k under risk factors forward looking statements 
information included in this discussion and analysis includes commentary on company owned and franchised restaurant units  restaurant sales  same store sales  and average weekly sales volumes 
management believes such sales information is an important measure of our performance  and is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of the buffalo wild wings grill bar concept and the overall health of the concept 
franchise information also provides an understanding of our revenues because franchise royalties and fees are based on the opening of franchised units and their sales 
however  franchise sales and same store sales information does not represent sales in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to financial information as defined or used by other companies 
overview as of december   we owned and operated and franchised an additional buffalo wild wings grill bar restaurants in states 
of the system wide restaurants  of those restaurants are located in ohio 
the restaurants have elements of both the quick casual and casual dining styles  both of which are part of a growing industry 
our long term focus is to grow to a national chain of over  locations  continuing the strategy of developing both company owned and franchised restaurants 
our growth targets for are unit growth  revenue growth  and to net earnings growth 
our growth and success depend on several factors and trends 
first  we continue to monitor and react to changes in our cost of goods sold 
the costs of goods sold is difficult to predict  as it ranged from to of restaurant sales per quarter in and  mostly due to the price fluctuation in chicken wings 
we are working to counteract the volatility of chicken wing prices with the introduction of popular new menu items  effective marketing promotions  focused efforts on food costs and waste  and menu price increases 
we will continue to monitor the cost of fresh chicken wings  as it can significantly change our cost of sales and cash flow from company owned restaurants 
we are also exploring purchasing strategies to lessen the severity of cost increases and fluctuations  and are reviewing menu additions and other strategies that may decrease the percentage that fresh chicken wings represent in terms of total restaurant sales 
the chart below illustrates the fluctuation in fresh chicken wing prices from quarter to quarter in the last five years 
average quarterly wing prices line graph a second factor is our success developing new markets 
there are inherent risks in opening new restaurants  especially in new markets  including the lack of experience  logistical support  and brand awareness in a new market 
these factors may result in lower than anticipated sales and cash flow for restaurants in new markets 
in  we plan to develop company owned restaurants primarily in markets where we currently have either company owned or franchised restaurants 
we believe this development focus  together with our focus on our new restaurant opening procedures  will help to mitigate the overall risk associated with opening restaurants in new markets 
third  we will continue our focus on trends in company owned and franchised same store sales as an indicator of the continued acceptance of our concept by consumers 
we also review the overall trend in average weekly sales as an indicator of our ability to increase the sales volume  and  therefore  cash flow per location 
we remain committed to high quality operations and guest hospitality 
our revenue is generated by sales at our company owned restaurants  which represented of total revenue in food and nonalcoholic beverages accounted for of restaurant sales 
the remaining of restaurant sales was from alcoholic beverages 
the menu item with the highest sales volume is chicken wings at of total restaurant sales 
royalties and franchise fees received from our franchisees 
we generate cash from the operation of our company owned restaurants and also from franchise royalties and fees 
we highlight the specific costs associated with the on going operation of our company owned restaurants in the statement of earnings under restaurant operating costs 
nearly all of our depreciation expense relates to assets used by our company owned restaurants 
preopening costs are those costs associated with opening new company owned restaurants and will vary annually based on the number of new locations opening 
loss on asset disposals and impairment expense is related to company owned restaurants  and includes the write down of underperforming locations  the costs associated with closures of locations and normal asset retirements 
certain other expenses  such as general and administrative  relate to both company owned restaurant and franchising operations 
we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
each of the fiscal years in the five years ended december  were week years except for the fiscal year ended december   which was a week year 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following discussion represents our more critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although it is not inclusive 
valuation of long lived assets and store closing reserves we review long lived assets quarterly to determine if the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is at the individual restaurant level 
in the absence of extraordinary circumstances  restaurants are included in the impairment analysis after they have been open for months 
we evaluate the recoverability of a restaurant s long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures over its remaining lease term  after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements  marketing programs  and anticipated changes in the trade area 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value based on our estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
during fiscal and  we recognized  and  respectively  of asset impairment charges 
no asset impairment charges were recognized during in addition to the valuation of long lived assets  we also record a store closing reserve when a restaurant is abandoned due to closure or relocation 
the store closing reserve is subject to significant judgment as accruals are made for lease payments on abandoned leased facilities 
many factors  including the local business environment  other available lease sites  and the willingness of lessors to negotiate lease buyouts are considered in making the accruals 
we estimate future lease obligations based on these factors and evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the estimated reserve based on current market conditions 
during   and  we recorded reserves of   and  respectively  for restaurants that closed 
the reconciliation of the store closing reserve for the years ended december   december   and december  is as follows in thousands as of dec 
 reserve costs incurred as of dec 
 remaining lease obligation and utilities as of dec 
 reserve costs incurred as of dec 
 remaining lease obligation and utilities as of dec 
 reserve costs incurred as of dec 
 remaining lease obligation and utilities goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually  or whenever circumstances change in a way which could indicate that impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is associated with a reporting unit  which we define as a number of locations within a geographic market which experience similar economic characteristics 
we identify potential goodwill impairments by using the income approach  which involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  which includes goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair value is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant 
if the carrying amount of the market exceeds the fair value  this is an indication that impairment may exist 
we calculate the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the asset with the carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the value of the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if this amount is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  impairment is recognized for the difference 
no goodwill impairment charges were recognized during   or vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances and other funds received from vendors 
certain of these funds are determined based on various quantitative contract terms 
we also receive vendor allowances from certain manufacturers and distributors calculated based upon purchases made by franchisees 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction of the related expense 
amounts that represent a reduction of inventory purchase costs are recorded as a reduction of inventoriable costs 
we record an estimate of earned vendor allowances that are calculated based upon monthly purchases 
we generally receive payment from vendors approximately days after the end of a month for that month s purchases 
during fiscal   and  vendor allowances were recorded as a reduction in inventoriable costs  and cost of sales was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively 
revenue recognition franchise operations our franchise agreements have terms ranging from to years 
these agreements also convey extension terms of or years depending on contract terms and if certain conditions are met 
we provide training  preopening assistance and restaurant operating assistance in exchange for area development fees  franchise fees and royalties of of the franchised restaurant s sales 
franchise fee revenue from individual franchise sales is recognized upon the opening of the restaurant when we have performed all of our material obligations and initial services 
area development fees are dependent upon the number of restaurants granted in the agreement as are our obligations under the area development agreement 
consequently  as our obligations are met  area development fees are recognized in relation to the expenses incurred with the opening of each new restaurant and any royalty free periods 
royalties are accrued as earned and are calculated each period based on reported franchisees sales 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  and employee health benefits 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims that may have arisen but have not yet been reported to us as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  and claims development history 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure for each of these programs 
significant judgment is required to estimate claims incurred but not reported as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the frequency or severity of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
for our stock based compensation valuation  we use the black scholes merton pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected life of the options  expected volatility over the expected term  the risk free interest rate  and the expected forfeitures 
compensation expense for restricted stock units is recognized for the expected number of shares vesting at the end of each annual period 
restricted stock units granted in are subject to cumulative one year  two year  and three year net earnings targets 
the number of units that vest each year is based on performance against those targets 
the expense recognized in the first year includes the full expense for units vesting at the end of the first year  half of the expense for units vesting at the end of the second year  and a third of the expense for units vesting at the end of the third year 
significant assumptions are made to estimate the expected net earnings levels for future years

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for new restaurant construction  remodeling and maintaining our existing company owned restaurants  working capital  acquisitions  and other general business needs 
we fund these expenses  except for acquisitions  primarily with cash from operations 
depending on the size of the transaction  acquisitions would generally be funded from cash and marketable securities balances 
the cash and marketable securities balance at december  was million

as of december   nearly all excess cash was invested in high quality municipal securities 
during fiscal   and  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for noncash expenses and an increase in accounts payable  and accrued expenses  and a decrease in refundable income taxes 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the larger number of restaurants in operation  the amount of construction activity at the end of  and the timing of payments 
the increase in accrued expenses was due primarily to higher utility accruals and losses related to future natural gas contracts 
the decrease in refundable income taxes was due to the timing of tax payments 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  and income tax receivables

investing activities included purchases of property and equipment related to the opening of new company owned restaurants and restaurants under construction in all periods 
in  we purchased nine franchised locations in nevada for million and opened new restaurants 
in and  we opened and new restaurants  respectively 
in  we expect capital expenditures for approximately new company owned restaurants to cost approximately million per location  and expenditures of approximately million for the maintenance and remodels of existing restaurants

lease terms are generally to years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance and other operating costs 
some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
we own the buildings in which of our restaurants operate and therefore have a very limited ability to enter into sale leaseback transactions as a potential source of cash 
the following table presents a summary of our contractual operating lease obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than one year years years after years operating lease obligations commitments for restaurants under development total we believe the cash flows from our operating activities and our balance of cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations and building commitments and meet our obligations in the foreseeable future 
our future cash outflows related to income tax uncertainties amounts to  these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of these liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r provides companies with principles and requirements on how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree as well as the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas r also requires certain disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
acquisition costs associated with the business combination will generally be expensed as incurred 
sfas r is effective for business combinations occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of sfas r is not permitted 
we will be required to apply the guidance in sfas r to any future business combinations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim period within those fiscal years 
we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
impact of inflation in the last three years we have not operated in a period of high general inflation  however  the cost of commodities  labor and certain utilities have generally increased or experienced price volatility 
our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions  overtime and tip credits 
significant numbers of our food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and or state minimum wage and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs in the last three years 
in addition  costs associated with our operating leases  such as taxes  maintenance  repairs and insurance  are often subject to upward pressure 
to the extent permitted by competition  we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth  by quarter  the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the two most recent years  as well as the same data expressed as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented 
restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the information for each quarter is unaudited and we have prepared it on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results 
all amounts  except per share amounts  are expressed in thousands 
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in same store sales  changes in fresh chicken wing prices  the timing and number of new restaurant openings and their related expenses  asset impairment charges  store closing charges  general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of municipal securities 
we do not believe there is a significant risk of non performance by these municipalities because of our investment policy restrictions as to acceptable investment vehicles 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  and restaurant operating costs 
substantial increases in these costs could impact operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along through higher menu prices 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable federal and state minimum wages  and increases in the minimum wage rates and tip credit wage rates could directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
commodity price risk many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather  production  availability and other factors outside our control 
we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food product risks 
we negotiate directly with independent suppliers for our supply of food and paper products 
we use members of unipro food services  inc  a national cooperative of independent food distributors  to distribute these products from the suppliers to our restaurants 
we have minimum purchase requirements with some of our vendors  but the terms of the contracts and nature of the products are such that our purchase requirements do not create a market risk 
the primary food product used by company owned and franchised restaurants is fresh chicken wings 
we work to counteract the effect of the volatility of chicken wing prices  which can significantly change our cost of sales and cash flow  with the introduction of popular new menu items  effective marketing promotions  focused efforts on food costs and waste  and menu price increases 
we also explore purchasing strategies to reduce the severity of cost increases and fluctuations 
we currently purchase our chicken wings at market prices 
if a satisfactory long term price agreement for chicken wings were to arise  we would consider locking in prices to reduce our price volatility 
fresh chicken wing prices in averaged lower than as the average price per pound dropped to in from in if there is a significant rise in the price of fresh chicken wings  and we are unable to successfully adjust menu prices or menu mix or otherwise make operational adjustments to account for the higher wing prices  our operating results could be adversely affected 
fresh chicken wings accounted for approximately   and of our cost of sales in   and  respectively  with an annual average price per pound of   and  respectively 
a increase in fresh chicken wing costs during  would have increased restaurant cost of sales by approximately million for fiscal additional information related to chicken wing prices and our approaches to managing the volatility thereof is included in item under results of operations
