the results of operations include the results of ansoft for the period from the date of acquisition july  through december  the company experienced higher revenues in from both the ansoft acquisition and from license and maintenance growth in the company s other products and services 
these revenues were partially offset by increased intangible amortization costs and increased operating expenses  including higher salaries and related headcount costs  as well as the additional costs associated with the ansoft business 
also  in connection with the acquisition of ansoft on july   the company borrowed million 
as of december   these remaining outstanding borrowings totaled million 
the company s financial position includes million in cash and short term investments  and working capital of million as of december  ansys develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers and designers across a broad spectrum of industries  including aerospace  automotive  manufacturing  electronics  biomedical  energy and defense 
headquartered at southpointe in canonsburg  pennsylvania  the company and its subsidiaries employ approximately  people as of december  and focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop  providing a common platform for fast  efficient and cost conscious product development  from design concept to final stage testing and validation 
the company distributes its ansys and ansoft suites of simulation technologies through a global network of independent channel partners and direct sales offices in strategic  global locations 
it is the company s intention to continue to maintain this mixed sales and distribution model 
the company licenses its technology to businesses  educational institutions and governmental agencies 
growth in the company s revenue is affected by the strength of global economies  general business conditions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of the company s products 
given the current global economic conditions and the increased strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company conducts transactions  the company believes that there may be a future adverse impact on the company s revenue streams and that these conditions may particularly impact the ansoft product line as ansoft has historically derived a significant portion of its total revenue from international sales

the company believes that the features  functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products are as strong as they have ever been 
however  the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles 
these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter 
the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and long term sales forecasts which are impacted not only by these long sales cycles but by current global economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that its overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results 
please see the sub section entitled sales forecasts under item a risk factors above for a complete discussion of the potential impact of the company s sales forecasts on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the company s management considers the intense competition and price pressure that it faces in the short and long term by focusing on expanding the breadth  depth  ease of use and quality of the technologies  features  functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products as compared to its competitors  investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of its

critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys  provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable 
the company determines the fair value of post contract customer support pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on separate sales of pcs 
revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract 
typically  the company s software leases include pcs which  due to the short term principally one year or less of the company s software lease licenses  cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes under the aicpa s technical practice aid 
as a result  both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period 
due to the short term nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically months  the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and  as a result  includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
revenue from training  support and other services is recognized as the services are performed 
the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act  such as providing a training class to a customer  and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example  both training and consulting 
in applying the proportional performance method  the company typically utilizes output based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials  and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract 
input based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials  utilizing direct labor as the input measure 
the company also executes arrangements through channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company s software products to end users of the company s products and services in specified territories 
in sales facilitated by channel partners  the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end user customer 
the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment  collectability from the channel partner is probable  a signed license agreement is received from the end user customer and delivery has occurred to the end user customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
revenue for channel partner transactions is recorded on a net basis the amount actually received by the company from the channel partner 
the company does not offer right of return  product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 
non income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses 
the collection and payment of these amounts is reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and does not impact reported revenues or expenses 

table of contents the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company s most current user manuals 
the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which the company is already obligated to provide  and consequently  the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 
the company s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company s software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including the company s right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding 
the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations  and consequently  the company has not established any related reserves 
the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographical area of origin 
in determining these percentages  the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer s industry and geographic region 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 
in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of this adoption  the company recognized approximately a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings of million and an increase to the january  balance of goodwill of million

r  such reversals will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal 
the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or  in the case of goodwill  the company s reporting units to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies 
in preparing the estimate of fair value  the company relies on a number of factors  including historical operating results  business plans  anticipated future cash flows  economic projections and other market data 
because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors  the company s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated 
when the company assigns a fair value to a trademark it also estimates whether it has a finite or indefinite life thus impacting whether the value is amortized or not 
events such as product and naming strategy changes can occur whereby the company may reconsider the life whether finite or indefinite  resulting in changes to amortization expense 
amortization periods may also be reconsidered with identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
the company is involved in various investigations  claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities 
the company reviews the status of these matters  assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation  claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates  the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change 
the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company s stock option plan 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company s common stock at a discount under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of statement no

effective january   the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of statement no

share based compensation expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively

in addition  during  the company issued million options pursuant to assumed stock options associated with the acquisition of ansoft  representing and of outstanding shares as of the beginning and end of the current fiscal year  respectively 
of the options issued associated with the acquisition  million were fully vested as of the acquisition date 
based on the requirements in statement no 
r  the value of each share based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the table below presents the assumptions used in calculating the compensation expense recorded within the company s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and the interest rates used were determined by using the five year treasury note yield on the date of grant 
compensation expense december  assumption used in black scholes option pricing model risk free interest rate to to to expected dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options  however  incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options 
the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable  as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company 
statement no 
r requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event 
the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected 
in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options  the company makes many assumptions and estimates  including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees  the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company s stock price on the exercise dates 
each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty 
additionally  a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense 
although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company s tax filings  this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income 
for example  the company realized a tax benefit of million during the year ended december  related to disqualified incentive stock options  however  only  of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense 
although there are significant limitations in estimating stock based compensation expense  including those discussed above  the company currently estimates that these costs will result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million million and a decrease in net income of approximately million million  or approximately per diluted share 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of statement no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that the company will record under statement no 
r may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
therefore  it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under statement no 
r 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because the company s share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely 
table of contents traded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company s estimates of fair values  in the company s opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company s share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that the company s estimates of the fair values of the company s share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company s financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company s financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with statement no 
r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to the company s financial statements  but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by the company 
for this reason  and because the company does not view share based compensation as related to its operational performance  the board of directors and management exclude estimated share based compensation expense when evaluating the company s underlying business performance

the amounts borrowed with respect to one of the credit agreements were paid in full as of december  the amounts borrowed with respect to the second credit agreement were paid in full as of june  in connection with the ansoft acquisition  the company entered into a million term loan with variable interest rates as of july  the term loan is scheduled to mature on july  and provides for tiered pricing with the initial rate at the prime rate  or the libor rate  with step downs permitted after the initial six months under the credit agreement down to a flat prime rate or the libor rate 
such tiered pricing is determined by the ratio of the total debt of the company to the company s earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain other items 
the credit agreement includes financial covenants tested quarterly  requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and  as is customary for facilities of this type  certain events of default that permit the acceleration of the loan 
borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled million as of december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on july  with a forward swap date of august  in order to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the new term loan 
under the swap agreement  the company receives the variable  three month libor rate required under its term loan and pays a fixed libor interest rate of on the notional amount
