item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview we are a global provider of information technology it  enterprise support and business process outsourcing services to fortune companies  government entities  multinational companies  product and service providers  and small and medium sized companies 
our business consists of two main components our commercial business and our government business 
together  our it outsourcing services segment  it consulting and systems integration segment and other services segment comprise our commercial business 
our government technology services segment comprises our government business 
in addition to managing our business by service line  we also manage our business by geographic markets the americas defined as north america excluding our government based subsidiaries  europe and government solutions defined as our government based subsidiaries 
together  the americas and europe comprise our commercial business 
the global economic crisis of presents unprecedented uncertainties to techteam and its customers 
we are affected by the general tightening in the credit markets  and lower consumer and business spending 
the economic crisis has affected the financial health of many of our customers 
at the same time  we are unable to fully anticipate the duration and scope of the downturn and  as such  we cannot provide our shareholders with good visibility of the effects of this crisis on the business 
most significantly  the economic downturn is having serious effects in at least two of our major industry verticals  the automotive and retail industries 
however  the actions we have taken in have better positioned techteam to weather the downturn 
in february  gary j 
cotshott joined the company in the role of president and chief executive officer 
mr 
cotshott led a thorough evaluation of all aspects of our business  which resulted in streamlining our global organization  developing a solid strategy for our future and recruiting a leadership team that supplements the pre existing leaders with new executive level talent that has deep experience and functional expertise 
in addition to these efforts  the company improved its financial flexibility by executing two restructuring plans  which resulted in a restructuring charge in totaling million  pre tax 
in addition to the organizational change and restructuring plan completed in the second quarter  which removed legacy costs and inefficiency from our business  the company completed a second restructuring plan in the fourth quarter due in part to the impact of the economic downturn on our customers and to better position the company to manage through this difficult economic period 
the second restructuring totaled million on a pre tax basis  and related primarily to exiting excess lease capacity and restructuring headcount in europe  largely related to the worsening economic conditions in that region 
we also took steps to implement our business strategy 
in the second quarter  techteam expanded its low cost delivery models through its acquisition of onvaio  llc  which provided techteam with cost effective delivery operations from the philippines 
in order to narrow our focus on our core service offerings and target customers  we divested techteam ane nv sa which included certain lower margin it consulting and systems integration capabilities focused on small business customers in belgium 
we have also implemented a capital management program to better evaluate and manage difficult customer accounts  collect outstanding accounts receivable  and manage our bank debt 
as a result of the contraction of the economy and a loss of a contract worth approximately million per year  we are experiencing a decline in revenue 
given the economic conditions  there is the potential of continued revenue erosion within our current customer base 
we have also been informed that we have or will be losing additional contracts over with an anticipated effect of less than of revenue 
at the same time  current market conditions present an opportunity to the company to offset the effects of erosion through new business 
our pipeline of new opportunities continues to be robust  although is subject to extended sales and implementation lead times due to the nature of economic conditions 

table of contents excluding restructuring charges  we continued to deliver solid results

it outsourcing services revenue from it outsourcing services increased  or million  to million for  from million for  primarily as a result of million of revenue growth in europe

ford motor company our business with ford consists of service desk and desk side services  technical staffing  network management and a specific project installing personal computers subcontracted through dell inc revenue generated through our business with ford decreased to million in  from million in and million in on december   techteam global  inc techteam executed a three year renewal of its global single point of contact spoc contract with ford motor company ford  under which techteam provides support services to ford s information technology infrastructure 
under the spoc contract  techteam will continue to provide service desk  deskside support  service management  infrastructure management  and identity and access management services to ford in north america  western europe  and asia 
the contract renewal provides for a significant change in the service delivery model 
these changes include the transition and centralization of service for english speaking ford personnel to our operations in the philippines  the transition of service for german speaking ford personnel to romania  and an enhanced centralized remote deskside support management function  which will reduce the number of visits necessary to support the deskside 
we anticipate this transition to be completed around the middle of as a result of the changes in the delivery model  we anticipate lower revenues under the renewed contract of approximately million in  due to our delivery from lower cost locations 
at this time  we do not anticipate a material change in the company s gross profit margin as a result of the renewal 
while there is revenue pressure from the decrease in the number of seats supported and from ford s continued efforts to seek cost savings on its total cost of it infrastructure support  we are working to offset the anticipated decrease in revenue through an expansion of the spoc program to parts of the ford enterprise that are not currently a part of the spoc program and the expansion of the scope of our services 
while we believe that we are well positioned to expand the spoc program  we do not anticipate any growth during the first half of moreover  with the global economic crisis significantly affecting ford s operations and financial performance  ford has announced its willingness to sell volvo car corporation 
it is possible that ford may sell volvo or otherwise allow volvo to withdraw from the spoc contract 
under the existing contract  except for our support of volvo  for whom we bill on a per incident basis  we provide a set of infrastructure support services under specific service level metrics  and we invoice ford based upon the number of seats we support 
the number of seats supported is determined bi annually on february and august of each year 
if certain contractual conditions are met  ford and techteam have the right during each six month period to request one out of cycle seat adjustment 
at december   ford owed the company million in the americas and million in europe 
ford has recently amended its north american standard purchase order terms to increase its payment terms from days to days from receipt of the invoice 
under the terms of the december  contract the change in north american payment terms will go into effect december   and  after that date  we therefore anticipate that there will be an increase in the aggregate accounts receivable due from ford 
we do not believe that ford s financial condition will otherwise affect our business with ford or the collectability of our accounts receivable from ford  however  any failure to retain a significant amount of business with ford  plant idling  a bankruptcy filing or major restructuring by ford  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 

table of contents us federal government we conduct business under multiple contracts with various agencies and departments of the us federal government 
revenue generated through our business with the us federal government increased to million in  from million in and million in in years when the us federal government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year  government operations typically are funded pursuant to a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the government to continue to operate  but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives 
when the us federal government operates pursuant to a continuing resolution  delays can occur in procurement of products and services  and such delays can affect our revenue  profit and cash flow during the period of delay 
the results of our government business have been negatively impacted by the difficult government contracting environment created by the budget constraints our customers faced 
as a result of this environment  many customers have delayed procurement actions 
in turn  we have experienced delays in our expected new business development 
we have been informed that we were not selected as prime contractor for the business transformation agency bta of the department of defense 
in  we earned million in revenue from the bta 
the direct impact of this loss is difficult to assess at this time because we believe that we can replace a significant portion of this revenue by performing the same services for the bta as a subcontractor to winning bidders 
however  there can be no assurances in this regard 
in  we have a few significant contracts that may be re competed  including our contract for the air national guard  with approximately million in annual revenue  and cio spii a gwac under which the company performs services to the national institutes of health  which may impact our ability to do business with the national institutes of health in the future

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  contingent liabilities  revenue recognition  goodwill and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that our critical accounting policies that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  accounts receivable  goodwill impairment  long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment  and business combinations 
revenue recognition under all situations  revenue is not recognized until earned  which is when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided  the revenue terms are fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn revenue under our it outsourcing services segment under one of the following four models time and material contracts under which we bill an agreed rate for each help desk agent based on the number of units ie  hours or days the individual agent worked during the month  per transaction contracts under which we bill an agreed rate per incident or call handled during a month or per minute for the length of the telephone call for the incident  fixed monthly fee contracts under which we agree to provide all of the agreed upon scheduled services on a monthly basis for a fixed monthly fee  and per seat contracts under which we agree to provide agreed upon scheduled services for a monthly fee that is determined by multiplying the number of users supported at the customer by the monthly per seat fee 
within the it outsourcing services segment  greater than of our services are delivered as a monthly service and not over multiple periods 
we also refer to our fixed fee and per seat contracts as managed service contracts 
many of our contracts that we bill on a per transaction basis contain a minimum monthly fee  which is derived by multiplying the agreed upon forecast of anticipated incidents by an agreed upon minimum percentage 
under this arrangement  we receive a minimum revenue amount for having committed to provide a specific level of staff to support the services projected during a month 
since we invoice the customer for the minimum fee and do not reduce future billings  we recognize the minimum fee as revenue in the month in which the incidents are below the customer s minimum forecast 
incident resolution usually occurs in the same month that incidents are reported 
under our managed service contracts  we generally do not incur material costs in a future month to complete a service obligation that arose in a prior month 
in those instances where our service obligation is not complete for a month and we expect to incur more than immaterial costs in a future month  we will defer an amount of revenue that represents the fair value of that service obligation 
revenue from all other services that we provide under our other operating segments government technology services  it consulting and systems integration  and other services may be categorized into two primary types time and material and fixed price 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue in these business segments was time and material and was fixed price a substantial majority of which were fixed price level of effort contracts 
revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with the customer  plus the cost of any allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
revenue is recognized under the majority of fixed price contracts  which are predominantly level of effort contracts  using the cost to cost method for all services provided 
in addition  we evaluate contracts for multiple deliverables  which may require the segmentation of each deliverable into separate accounting units for proper revenue recognition 

table of contents our contracts with agencies of the us federal government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the term of the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time  we may proceed with work and recognize revenue on unfunded portions of existing contracts based on customer direction pending finalization and signing of formal funding documents 
in evaluating the probability of funding being received  we consider our previous experience with the customer  communications with the customer regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue is deferred and is not recognized 
we recognize revenue under cost based us federal government contracts based on allowable contract costs  as mandated by the us federal government s cost accounting standards 
the costs we incur under us federal government contracts are subject to regulation and audit by certain agencies of the us federal government 
contract cost disallowances  resulting from government audits  have not historically been significant 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes represent temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
if at any time we believe that current or future taxable income does not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is provided 
based on historical losses in belgium and romania  we have provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward in these countries 
we anticipate providing a valuation allowance for any future losses incurred in belgium and romania 
no valuation allowance has been recognized against other deferred tax assets  which are in the united states  as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized based on estimates of future taxable income  which have considered  among other factors  the future benefits of our recent acquisitions 
accounts receivable we periodically review our accounts receivable balances for collectibility based on a combination of historical experience and existing economic conditions 
the definition of delinquent accounts is based on the governing contractual terms 
delinquent accounts and balances are reserved when we determine they are more likely than not to become uncollectible 
we generally do not require collateral and do not charge interest on past due balances 
we generally continue to be able to collect from our customers and currently do not know of any large accounts which will become uncollectible in the future  however  the credit rating of at least ford and several automotive component companies have declined to well below investment grade 
these downgrades have not negatively affected our relationship with these customers or the collectibility of our accounts receivable from these customers at this time  however  any bankruptcy filing by ford would have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford and our operating results and liquidity 
additionally  there could be concern with other automotive industry customers related to a ford bankruptcy and or depressed industry 
goodwill impairment goodwill relating to our acquisitions represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired  and has a carrying amount of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in goodwill in was related to the acquisition of onvaio 
during the years ended december  and  we performed our annual impairment test as of october of each year  and did not incur an impairment charge 
during the year ended december   as a result of recent economic events and the decline in our stock price  we updated our annual goodwill impairment testing from october  to perform an interim impairment test as of december  we determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as a result of the interim testing and will continue to monitor the relationship of the company s fair value to its book value as economic events and changes to our stock price occur 
if future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges at a later date 

table of contents long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment the carrying amount of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors or events indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to evaluate whether the costs are recoverable 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or contract  decreases in us federal government funding of certain programs  or other similar events 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued using certain software related to our help desk operations 
we expected no future cash flows related to the asset and  therefore  recorded an impairment loss equal to the net book value of the asset of  which was recorded in our it outsourcing services segment 
we did not record an impairment loss in any other period presented 
business combinations we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations  while costs incurred by us for unsuccessful or terminated acquisition opportunities are expensed when we determine that such opportunities will no longer be pursued 
costs incurred related to probable business combinations are deferred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on june   the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for long term borrowings at variable rates of interest based upon either the london interbank offered rate libor  the bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate  each of which having an applicable interest margin added 
upon entering into the agreement  the company borrowed million to finance part of the acquisition of newvectors 
on june   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to hedge the variable rate of interest on the company borrowings 
for the year ended december  and  the company recorded a loss of approximately  and  respectively  as interest expense on the interest rate swap 
the company has recorded a liability of million and  for the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  and  respectively  for which the corresponding offset has been recorded as an unrealized loss within other comprehensive income 
on june   the company and the banks amended the credit agreement to permit borrowings up to  in addition  the applicable margin on a libor based loan was modified from a range of to a range of  and the unused commitment fee increased from a range of to a range of 
borrowings under the credit agreement are currently secured by substantially all domestic assets of the company and of its interests in the majority of its foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement terminates on may  our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk associated with the outstanding loan under the credit agreement 
the market exposure for the variable interest rate on the loan is mitigated by the interest rate swap with a notional amount of million and million at december  and  respectively 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt and assuming the debt was outstanding since january   interest expense would have increased approximately  in the estimated increase in interest expense was based on the portion of our variable interest debt that was not offset by the interest rate swap agreement and assumes no changes in the volume or composition of the debt 

table of contents in the normal course of business  we are subject to market exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations as we provide services in the united states and europe 
as a result  our financial results and position could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and european currencies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
also  certain of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
as currency exchange rates change  our operating results will be affected by foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the receivable balance until it is collected 
we generally do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates related to trade receivables 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option or forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and european euro 
no derivatives  options contracts or similar instruments were outstanding at december  or we do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million at december  and approximately million and million of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries at december  and  respectively  are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
the potential loss on trade receivables from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be  and  at december  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates yet exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency
