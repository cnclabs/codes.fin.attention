item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur  it could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our industry we are subject to the cyclical changes caused by general global and industry conditions 
the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose and absorbent products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
our financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
furthermore  a general economic downturn in a particular country or on an international scale could reduce the overall sales within our industry  thereby likely reducing our sales 
we cannot assure you that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition and surplus capacity could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for our products are all competitive 
actions by competitors can affect our ability to sell our products and can affect the volatility of the prices at which our products are sold 
other actions by competitors  such as reducing costs or adding low cost capacity  may adversely affect our competitive position in the products we manufacture and  consequently  our sales  operating income and cash flows 
new competitors and the expansion of existing competitors could create a surplus capacity of the goods that we sell  which might cause us to either lose sales or lower the prices of our goods 
actions by our competitors and any surplus capacity could cause our sales and profits to decline  affecting our operating results and financial condition 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of energy and raw materials are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
energy  chemicals  and raw material costs  including fuel oil  natural gas  electricity  cotton linters  wood  and caustic and other chemicals are a significant operating expense 
the prices and availability of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions  currency fluctuations  weather conditions  political unrest and instability in energy producing nations  and supply and demand considerations 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we had raw material availability issues at our memphis and americana specialty fibers plants 
currently  our production is not constrained by raw material availability  but is constrained by reduced demand for our specialty cotton fiber products 
energy and chemical costs which had increased substantially in recent years  resulting in increased production costs for our products  have recently moderated 
increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to increased costs  it is possible that a disruption in supply of natural gas or other fossil fuels could limit our ability to operate our facilities 
market fluctuations in the availability and cost of transportation are beyond our control and may adversely impact our business 
our business depends on the transportation of a large number of products  both domestically and internationally 
an increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges and or a reduction in transport availability in truck  rail and international shipping could negatively impact our ability to provide products to our customers in a timely manner 
an increase in international shipping rates or fuel surcharges or a reduction in the availability of vessels could negatively impact our costs and our ability to provide products to our international customers in a timely manner 
while we have had adequate transportation availability  there is no assurance that such availability can continue to be effectively managed in the future 
risks related to our business exposure to commodity products creates volatility in pricing and profits 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
if our significant customer changes its purchasing habits  our business could be adversely affected 
procter gamble is our largest single customer 
we supply procter gamble with fluff pulp and airlaid nonwovens  and sales to procter gamble accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal year in the event that procter gamble fails to continue to purchase these products from us in substantial volume  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected  particularly if we are unable to attract new customers 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 
as of june   our total debt was approximately million and our total debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was 
our level of debt could have a significant adverse future effect on our business 
for example we may have limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  our senior secured credit facility covenants require us to meet certain financial objectives and impose other restrictions on business operations 
these covenants and those contained in the indenture governing our senior notes limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  our debt level and the various covenants contained in the indenture related to our senior notes and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors  and our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at floating rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
our ability to pay principal of and interest on our senior notes  to service our other debt and to refinance indebtedness when necessary depends on our financial and operating performance  each of which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
if we are unable to pay our debts  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible at the time or prove adequate 
also  certain alternative strategies will require the consent of our senior secured lenders before we engage in any such strategy 
our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if our negotiations with the representatives of the unions  to which many of our employees belong  are not successful  our operations could be subject to interruptions at many of our facilities  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
as of august   we employed approximately  employees  of whom approximately  are employed at our facilities in the united states 
approximately of the us employees are represented by unions at two plants in perry  florida and memphis  tennessee 
our foley plant s labor agreement is in effect through april  the agreement for the memphis plant is in effect through march  at our canadian facility  the labor agreement expired on june   but was automatically extended until negotiations are completed 
negotiations are scheduled to begin in september employee representation is provided by a national union for non management workers at our specialty fibers plant in americana  brazil  and a works council at our nonwoven materials plant in steinfurt  germany 
our plants in gaston  lumberton and king  north carolina are not unionized 
the failure to renegotiate labor agreements in a timely manner could lead to a curtailment or stoppage of work at our factories 
if we negotiated a labor agreement on unfavorable terms  our production costs will increase 
a reduction in production or increasing the costs of production would lower our profits and harm our business 
compliance with extensive general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations requires significant resources  and the significant associated costs may adversely impact our business 
our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations 
such environmental laws and regulations at the federal level include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  the clean air act of  as amended  the clean water act of  as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  the toxic substances control act of  as amended  and the safe drinking water act of  as amended 
these environmental regulatory programs are primarily administered by the us environmental protection agency epa 
in addition  the individual states and foreign countries in which we operate have adopted and may adopt in the future equivalent or more stringent environmental laws and regulations or have enacted their own parallel environmental programs 
we closely monitor our environmental compliance with current environmental requirements and believe that we are in substantial compliance 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements  including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions  such as emissions of greenhouse gases  and general permitting requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
we also expect that we will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
any failure on our part to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to penalties or other sanctions that could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we cannot currently assess  however  the impact that more stringent environmental requirements may have on our operations or capital expenditure requirements 
we do not anticipate that capital expenditures in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance will have a material effect on our earnings during fiscal year because approximately of our sales are to customers outside the united states  we are subject to the economic and political conditions of foreign nations 
we have manufacturing facilities in four countries and sell products in approximately countries 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales of our products outside the united states represented approximately of our sales 
the global economy and relative strength or weakness of the us dollar can have a significant impact on our sales 
in addition  although approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars  it is possible that as we expand globally  we will face increased risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including the risk that foreign currencies will be devalued or that currency exchange rates will fluctuate  the risk that limitations will be imposed on our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or on our foreign subsidiaries ability to remit dividends and other payments to the united states  the risk that our foreign subsidiaries will be required to pay withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to the united states or that the amount of any such taxes will be increased  the risk that certain foreign countries may experience hyperinflation  and the risk that foreign governments may impose or increase investment or other restrictions affecting our business 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition

all of the facilities located in the united states are pledged as collateral for certain debt agreements 
we believe that our specialty fibers and nonwoven materials manufacturing facilities and administrative buildings are adequate to meet current operating demands 
item legal proceedings on january   kt equipment international kt  inc filed a claim in the united states district court  western district of tennessee  against us  in which kt alleged that we breached our obligation under the stac pac acquisition agreement to pay kt a contingent promissory note in the principal amount of million plus accrued interest 
payment of the contingent note was dependent on the satisfaction of certain specified conditions relating to the rights obtained by us with regard to the intellectual property assets 
when these conditions were not met pursuant to the terms of the stac pac acquisition agreement  we canceled the contingent note in the year ended june  on august   we entered into a settlement agreement with kt for an immaterial amount 
in addition to the matter set forth above  we are involved from time to time in routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess the probability and amount of potential loss 
these assessments are re evaluated at each reporting period and as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under gaap to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
we believe the resolution of routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results from operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discussing our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies 
unless otherwise indicated  references to a year eg  refers to our fiscal year ended june of that year 
executive summary buckeye manufactures and distributes value added cellulose based specialty products used in numerous applications  including disposable diapers  personal hygiene products  engine  air and oil filters  concrete reinforcing fibers  food casings  cigarette filters  rayon filaments  acetate plastics  thickeners and papers 
our products are produced in the united states  canada  germany and brazil  and we sell these products in approximately countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
the key focus areas for buckeye over the next twelve months include living within our means by focusing on cash flow maximization to pay down debt  optimizing capacity utilization  restarting the foley energy project and identifying new bio energy initiatives that support profitable  sustainable growth  and accelerating the rate of change to a lean enterprise culture 
was a challenge for buckeye as the global economic recession impacted demand for many of our products 
sales of million were down million or versus  with the specialty fibers segment down and sales in the nonwoven materials segment down 
reduced shipment volume had a negative million impact on sales compared to  while higher selling prices added million 
unfavorable product mix and currency made up the balance 
specialty fibers sales were negatively impacted by reduced demand for cotton specialty products  wood specialty fibers used in automotive and construction applications and fluff pulp 
we took significant downtime at our memphis and americana plants during to match production to shipment demand 
during  we reduced staffing at our memphis plant to adjust our capacity to match reduced demand levels for products supplied by this plant 
shipment volume for our airlaid nonwovens products was down versus primarily because the business lost in january has not yet been completely replaced 
selling prices were up on average year over year for our high end specialty wood and cotton fibers products  but our fluff pulp prices were down by about on average 
our nonwoven materials prices were up approximately 
our operating loss for was million and included two major items 
on december   based on the economic environment and the steep decline in the price of our stock at that time  which created a significant gap between the book and market value of our equity  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge 
during the april june quarter  we recorded million of income from alternative fuel mixture credits 
after accounting for these items  the remaining reduction in operating income from was million which was due to the lower sales volume and associated market related downtime  as increased selling prices were sufficient to offset increased input costs 
strong cash flow generation  including million from alternative fuel mixture credits  enabled us to reduce debt by million during our interest and amortization of debt costs decreased million as compared to as the result of lower debt and lower average interest rates 
on july  we redeemed the remaining million of our senior subordinated notes using borrowings on our credit facility 
for  based on the current variable interest rate environment  we expect the combination of lower variable interest rates on our revolving credit facility versus the bonds and lower debt levels to reduce net interest expense and amortization of debt costs to less than million 
we have also established a new debt target of million by the end of we are focused on reducing cost and maintaining a tight control on working capital 
we continue to have a temporary wage freeze for all salaried employees and temporary salary reductions for all officers of the company in the range of to 
we will evaluate the need for this cost reduction step each quarter but believe we will reverse the salary reductions and lift the wage freeze at the end of the calendar year as business results improve 
in may  we further reduced staffing at our memphis plant  aligning capacity utilization with current market conditions 
as of june   our year over year total headcount was down to approximately total employees 
we anticipate and have announced a reduction in total headcount in the current quarter 
our foley energy project  which was based on a design goal of an annual equivalent reduction of over  barrels of oil  meets the criteria for several federal and state grant funds 
the alternative fuel mixture credits have helped us reduce our debt and improve our liquidity and with the help of a million grant from the state of florida we have resumed this project to avoid any further delays in achieving the benefits 
in addition to improving our cost structure and cash flow by making the foley plant nearly energy self sufficient  the project also lays the groundwork for potential additional revenue streams from energy sales 
we have spent million on this million project through june  we anticipate spending an additional million in we have been working to take advantage of the foley plant s bio energy capabilities and recently announced that we are working on an agreement with the university of florida for establishing a demonstration bio refinery at foley 
the demonstration facility will explore processes to generate green bio chemicals for a variety of end market applications 
results of operations consolidated results the following table compares the components of consolidated operating income for the three fiscal years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  research and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles and other impairment and restructuring costs n a alternative fuel mixture credits operating income loss the global economic downturn had an unfavorable impact on the demand for many of our products 
net sales decreased for versus  primarily due to lower shipment volume in both the specialty fibers and nonwoven materials segments 
lower shipment volume accounted for approximately million of the decline 
higher selling prices for our products partially offset the lower volume  with selling prices being up approximately on average compared to million 
gross margin was lower for versus by million 
lower shipment volume and associated market related production downtime resulted in lost margin on reduced shipments and higher costs due to lower capacity utilization rates 
overall selling price increases have more than offset increases in raw material  chemical and energy prices over that same period 
we started to see reductions in raw materials  energy and transportation costs in the january march quarter and reductions in chemical costs in the april june quarter 
net sales increased for  primarily due to selling prices which were higher by approximately on average compared to  accounting for million in incremental sales 
partially offsetting the impact of favorable price increases  sales volumes declined versus  accounting for a reduction in sales of million 
nonwovens accounted for the largest part of this sales volume impact million as a result of the loss of business with a large customer in january 
lower sales volume at our two specialty cotton fiber mills due to raw material availability issues also negatively impacted sales by million compared to the prior year 
our gross margin improved by million in versus our selling price increases of million more than offset the impact of higher costs for raw materials and the lower shipment and production volumes 
raw material costs were higher year over year million mainly for cotton linter fibers million and in our nonwoven materials million business 
increased chemical costs million overall were partially offset by lower usage at our specialty wood fibers facility 
higher energy costs had a negative impact of million and higher transportation costs reduced our gross margin by million compared to the prior year 
selling  research and administrative expenses decreased million in selling  research and administrative expenses increased slightly in as a percentage of net sales these costs increased to in versus in and in based on the economic environment and the steep decline in the price of our stock at that time  which created a significant gap between the book and market value of our equity  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  during the three months ended march   we completed this analysis 
we concluded that there was no change to the impairment loss of million we recognized at december  since this goodwill impairment charge is non cash  it does not affect our liquidity or financial covenants 
the us internal revenue code permits a refundable excise tax credit under certain circumstances for the production and use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel mixtures in lieu of fossil based fuels 
the credit is equal to 
per gallon of alternative fuel contained in the mixture 
we qualify for the alternative fuel mixture credit because we produce liquid fuels derived from biomass  byproducts of our wood pulping process  and utilize those fuels to power our foley plant 
we recorded million in alternative fuel mixture credits  which was net of expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations related to claims filed for the period from february  through june  as of june  we had received million in cash related to these claims 
we will be claiming an additional million as income tax credits on our tax return 
we have treated the credits received in cash as taxable income and the income tax credits as non taxable income 
the alternative fuel mixture credits are subject to audit by the irs 
further discussion of revenue and operating trends can be found later in this md a 
additional information on the goodwill impairment may also be found in note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 
segment results although nonwoven materials  processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fibers segment consists of our chemical cellulose  customized fibers and fluff pulp product lines which are cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
we make separate financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administrative expenses to each segment  and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the two segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  the impact of goodwill impairment loss  alternative fuel mixture credits  amortization of intangibles  and unallocated at risk and stock based compensation 
we have reclassified the at risk compensation and stock based compensation from the specialty fibers and nonwovens segments for for comparability 
specialty fibers the following table compares specialty fibers net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income specialty fibers net sales were down  primarily due to lower shipment volume for versus as the global economic downturn impacted demand for many of our products 
shipment volume for the specialty fibers segment was down compared to  with specialty wood fibers shipments off and specialty cotton fibers off 
specialty wood fibers sales were most negatively impacted by reduced demand for fluff pulp and specialty wood grades used in automotive and construction applications 
partially offsetting the lower volume were higher prices of approximately on our wood specialty products excluding fluff and on our cotton specialty products 
fluff pulp prices decreased approximately per ton compared to operating income for versus was unfavorably affected by the lower sales volume and lower production volume 
higher raw material costs million  primarily due to the increase in cotton fibers  higher chemical costs million  higher energy costs million and higher transportation costs million contributed to the lower operating income 
the higher specialty fibers prices  lower direct cost spending and favorable exchange rates in brazil partially offset the unfavorable items 
net sales increased in versus  primarily due to higher prices 
selling prices were up approximately on our wood specialty products and on our cotton specialty fibers products 
in  fluff pulp prices increased approximately per ton compared to shipment volume was down approximately  partially offsetting the favorable price increases 
operating income improved as a percentage of sales from in to in the favorable impact of higher selling prices million was partially offset by higher raw material costs million  mainly due to the increase in cotton fibers for which costs were up year over year 
in addition  higher chemical  energy and transportation costs reduced the favorable impact of the higher selling prices 
our operating loss at americana was reduced by approximately in versus increased pricing  higher production volume and reductions in fixed costs helped offset the higher cotton linter prices and the strengthening brazilian currency versus brl usd 
nonwoven materials the following table compares nonwoven materials net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income nonwoven materials sales decreased in versus  primarily due to lower shipment volume million and a weakening of the euro versus the us dollar million 
higher pricing of million partially offset the impact of lower volumes 
shipment volumes for the nonwoven materials segment were down 
part of this reduction is because we have not yet completely replaced the business lost in january and part is due to the global recession 
shipment volume for our airlaid nonwovens products used in wipes  however  our largest product category  was up year over year by about 
selling prices were up about on the average compared to the prior year 
operating income decreased million for the year ended june  versus the year ended june  the impact of lower sales volumes  unfavorable product mix and higher raw material prices were partially offset by higher selling prices  lower transportation costs  a weaker canadian dollar and reduced selling  research  and administrative spending 
nonwoven materials sales increased in versus strong sales volume in the first half of was offset by weak volume in the second half of the year due to the loss of business with a long time customer 
shipment volume year over year was down from to improved pricing and improved product mix contributed million and million  respectively  to the sales increase 
the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar provided million of the increased revenues 
operating income decreased in versus the impact of higher sales prices was more than offset by lower volume  higher raw material costs for fluff pulp  bi component fiber and latex binder  and higher energy and transportation costs 
corporate our intercompany net sales elimination represents intercompany sales from our florida and memphis specialty fiber facilities to our airlaid nonwovens plants 
the unallocated at risk compensation and unallocated stock based compensation represent compensation for executive officers and certain other employees 
we have reclassified the at risk compensation and stock based compensation from the specialty fibers and nonwovens segments for for comparability 
the following tables compare corporate net sales and operating loss for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating loss n a the operating loss for the three years ended june consists of millions unallocated at risk compensation unallocated stock based compensation intellectual property amortization restructuring expenses goodwill impairment loss gross margin on intercompany sales alternative fuel mixture credits restructuring activities restructuring program in january  we entered into a restructuring program that complements our operations consolidations and involves consolidation in our european sales offices  product and market development and corporate overhead operations 
the total cost of this program was approximately million and was completed during the first quarter of the as a result of this restructuring  positions were eliminated 
interest expense and amortization of debt costs interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for versus this improvement was the result of lower average debt levels and lower average interest rates during in addition  approximately million more interest was capitalized on long term projects in versus interest expense and amortization of debt costs decreased million for versus this improvement was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during and lower average interest rates 
this favorable impact was partially offset by the decrease in interest expense in due to the reversal of million of interest related to the cancellation of a contingent note owed to stac pac technologies inc gain loss on early extinguishment of debt costs during  we used borrowings on our revolving credit facility to purchase million of the notes at a discount of 
as a result of this extinguishment  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs 
the net of the discount and the deferred financing costs resulted in a gain of million 
during  we used cash from operations and borrowings on our revolving credit facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes and to redeem million of the notes 
as a result of these extinguishments  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expenses of million during during we used cash from operations to redeem million of our senior subordinated notes due in and to make voluntary prepayments on our term loan of million 
as a result of these partial extinguishments  we wrote off a portion of deferred financing costs  resulting in non cash expense of million during see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt issuance and related extinguishment 
gain on sale of assets held for sale in september  the remaining assets located at our glueckstadt facility were sold for million 
because we had previously written the value of these assets down to million  we recorded a gain on sale of assets held for sale of million during foreign exchange and other foreign exchange and other in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the loss in was primarily due to a settlement fee in relation to the stac pac litigation and a charge related to the termination of hedge accounting treatment on the interest rate swap 
the income in was primarily due to foreign currency gains as a result of the strengthening of the brazilian real 
the income in was primarily due to million from a water conservation partnership payment received pursuant to our reduction in the daily water permit limit at the foley plant 
income tax expense our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in and in on december  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge and we recognized a tax benefit of million in connection with the goodwill impairment charge 
during  we claimed the alternative fuel mixture credits as cash refunds through the filing of periodic excise tax refund claims and as income tax credits on the federal income tax return to be filed for the tax year 
for purposes of calculating federal and state income taxes  we treat the credits claimed as cash refunds of excise tax as taxable income and the credits claimed on the federal income tax return as nontaxable income 
in  we recorded a tax benefit of million due to the nontaxable nature of the alternative fuel mixture credits claimed on the federal income tax return 
during  we increased our valuation allowance from million to million 
the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for net operating losses of americana  brazil  net operating losses in canada  and net operating losses in certain state tax jurisdictions 
we reduced the valuation allowance related to state tax net operating losses by million to reflect changes to the estimate of expected utilization 
we increased the valuation allowance in brazil by million to eliminate the tax benefit of current year losses 
in addition to accounting for the current year losses  we reduced the valuation allowance in brazil by million to reflect favorable currency translation adjustments 
the net increase to the valuation allowance recorded in brazil was million 
during  we decreased our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for net operating losses of the americana  brazil operations by million due to tax planning associated with intercompany interest charges offsetting the operating losses 
during  we increased our valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for net operating losses of the americana  brazil operations by million 
this was almost entirely offset by a reduction of valuation allowances in the amount of million related to certain state net operating losses and tax credits due to tax planning efforts 
due to the impairment of goodwill in and cumulative book losses net of intercompany charges in our canadian operations over the past three years  we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to net operating losses which we believe will expire unutilized 
we also increased the valuation allowance in canada by million to reflect unfavorable currency translation adjustments 
the total increase to the valuation allowance recorded in canada was million 
effective december  canada enacted canada bill c which reduced its canadian corporate tax rates to for  for  for  for and for and later years 
this reduction in corporate rates resulted in a remeasurement of canadian deferred tax balances with a net tax benefit of million in furthermore  changes in estimates and tax planning resulted in a net tax benefit of million in fiscal related to utilization of canadian net operating loss carryforwards 
effective july  germany reduced its tax rates resulting in a million net tax benefit for related to remeasurement of german deferred tax liabilities based on reversal of temporary differences 
on july   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of the adoption  we recorded an adjustment of million to reduce retained earnings at july  at adoption and june   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and cumulative potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled million 
we include interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income before income taxes 
all unrecognized tax benefits at adoption would affect the effective tax rate  if recognized 
during  as a result of a north carolina audit  we were able to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by million and our related interest and penalties by million 
these reductions leave a balance in unrecognized tax benefits and our related interest and penalties of million and million  respectively 
financial condition our financial condition continued to improve during with the million debt reduction 
we are committed to reducing our debt  strengthening our operations and continuing to improve our profitability and cash flow 
liquidity and capitalization after the redemption of our senior subordinated notes  we have the following major sources of financing a senior secured credit facility and senior notes 
our senior secured credit facility and senior notes contain various covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of june   and believe we will continue to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
these sources of financing are described in detail in note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total debt and capital leases decreased million to million at june  from million at june  from june  to june   total debt decreased by million 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june   as compared to at june  and at june  on july   we established a new million senior secured revolving credit facility with a maturity date of july  this facility amended and restated our previous credit facility 
initially  we used the proceeds from this credit facility to pay the outstanding balance on the former credit facility plus fees and expenses 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility is grid based pricing  related to our total leverage ratio  at the agent s prime rate plus to or a libor based rate ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
we also used proceeds from this facility to redeem the remaining million of our notes  to redeem million of the notes in mid september  and for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets located in the united states 
our credit facility contains covenants customary for financing of this type 
the financial covenants include maximum total leverage ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
during and at june   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit facility 
on june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and we had million borrowing capacity on our credit facility 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranges from to per annum based on a grid related to our leverage ratio 
total costs for the issuance of the facility were approximately million and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the facility 
on june  we amended the notes to permit the redemption  repurchase or retirement of subordinated indebtedness  including our senior subordinated notes due  up to sixteen months prior to maturity  which represents an increase of four months compared to the existing indenture 
we paid a consent fee of million in the aggregate to all consenting holders 
on july  we redeemed the remaining million of our notes using borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
we recorded million in alternative fuel mixture credits  which was net of expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations related to claims filed for the period from february  through june  as of june  we had received million in cash related to these claims 
we will be claiming an additional million as income tax credits on our fiscal tax return 
we have treated the credits received in cash as taxable income and the income tax credits as non taxable income 
in july  we received million in cash related to alternative fuel mixture credits 
our current plan is to claim future alternative fuel mixture credits as income tax credits 
the alternative fuel mixture credits are subject to audit by the irs 
the application of the alternative fuel mixture tax credit to the alternative fuel used in the pulp and paper industry is a complicated issue that continues to receive significant attention from the us congress 
the credit is scheduled to expire on december  however  there has been significant discussion about early termination of the credit 
although this does create some uncertainty related to the future of this credit  we believe that amounts reflected in income to date have met the income recognition criteria 
while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the next twenty four months 
treasury stock during to the board of directors authorized total repurchases of million shares of common stock 
during and  we repurchased million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock at a total cost of million and million  respectively 
at june   a total of million shares have been repurchased under these authorizations 
on august  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of common stock in addition to the million shares of common stock previously authorized 
repurchased shares  if any  are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
our notes limit the funds available to repurchase stock and currently we are prohibited from repurchasing stock 
cash flow cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june  and million at june  the following table provides a summary of cash flows for the three years ended june  millions operating activities net income loss noncash charges and credits  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment proceeds from sales of assets other investing activities net cash used in investing activities financing activities net borrowings payments under lines of credit payments on long term debt and other other financing activities  net net cash used in financing activities effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily due to the million in cash received from alternative fuel mixture credits during the year  which offset the negative impact of reduced sales revenue and gross margin 
cash flow in also benefitted from lower inventory levels  partially offset by lower accounts payable and current liabilities 
the inventory decrease was primarily due to lower levels of raw cotton linters and lower prices on raw materials at all sites 
the decrease in accounts payable was also due to the lower inventory levels and lower prices for raw materials  chemicals and energy 
finally  the lower level of net sales resulted in cash generated from reduced accounts receivable million in compared to an increase in accounts receivable of million in due to increased net sales in that year 
the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in was primarily due to higher inventory levels  partially offset by improved profits of million 
the inventory increase was primarily due to increasing inventory levels of raw cotton linters from very low levels at the beginning of the year  and higher raw material costs across all of our businesses 
net cash used in investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment of million in were down million compared to the prior year 
this was also well below our budget of million for the year as we slowed down capital spending in general and put our foley energy project on hold during the third quarter  in response to the downturn in the economy  in order to conserve cash and focus on paying down debt 
we expect efficiency improvement and energy savings projects  maintenance capital  and environmental spending will result in total capital expenditures of approximately million for  of which million will be for the foley energy project 
our board of directors has approved total capital expenditures of million over a three year period for this project  which was based on a design goal of an equivalent reduction of over  barrels of oil annually 
we have spent million of this amount through june  we expect to incur significant capital expenditures in the future to comply with environmental obligations at our perry  florida specialty fibers facility 
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a number of factors  including when the final npdes permit is issued and its final terms and conditions 
for additional information on environmental matters  see note  contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in financing activities during  we used cash from operations to reduce our debt and capital leases by million 
during  we used cash from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises to reduce our debt and capital leases by million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations after taking into consideration the redemption of the remaining notes on july  using borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years greater than years long term obligations operating lease obligations timber commitments other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations amounts include related interest payments 
interest payments for variable debt of million are based on the effective rate as of june  of 
interest payments on the notes consist of interest from july  to july  at a fixed rate of and interest for the period of july  to june  and thereafter at a variable rate of

less than one year references  years references and  years references and note additionally  the cash flow to fund postretirement benefit obligations  for our us plan has an expected net present value of million 
the actuarially estimated annual benefit payments are as follows million  million  million  and through million 
these obligations are not included in the table above as the total obligation is based on the present value of the payments and would not be consistent with the contractual cash obligations disclosures included in the table above

recent accounting pronouncements see note  recent accounting pronouncements  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their impact 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectability of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
bad debt expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
deferred income taxes and other liabilities deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those future events 
in  we increased our valuation allowance against certain foreign net operating losses by approximately million 
in  we decreased our valuation allowance recorded against certain foreign net operating losses by approximately million 
in  we increased the valuation allowance recorded against certain foreign net operating losses by approximately million and decreased the valuation allowances recorded against certain state net operating losses and tax credits by approximately million 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
we record our world wide tax provision based on the tax rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant managerial judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
where we believe that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in our income tax returns 
on july  we adopted the provisions of fin  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
we record our unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities 
cumulative potential interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are included as a component of income before income taxes 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method which is based on the expected productive hours of the assets  subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets is determined to not be recoverable  we measure the potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their fair value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
no circumstances existed in and to indicate the carrying value of any of our assets may not be recoverable 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have previously adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives 
in accordance with sfas  we perform a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis  in the fourth fiscal quarter  and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill of businesses acquired is specifically identified to the reporting units to which the businesses belong 
we estimate fair value based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows and an appropriate discount rate or weighted average cost of capital representing the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of future cash flows 
the discount rate is based on independently calculated beta risks for a composite group of companies  our target capital mix and an estimated market risk premium 
the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows were consistent with the reporting unit s internal planning 
the market approach estimates the fair value of our reporting units on comparable market prices 
goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
the first step is the estimation of fair value 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
during our quarter ended december   based on the economic environment and the steep decline in the price of our stock at that time  which created a significant gap between the book and market value of our equity  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of december  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million which represented our best estimate of the resulting goodwill impairment 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist with this impairment testing by expressing opinions as of december  of the fair values of the business enterprises of our four reporting units 
the results of step one indicated goodwill was impaired at three of our reporting units as the estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the reporting units 
as such  step two of the goodwill impairment test was performed to determine the actual amount of goodwill impairment 
in this step  we were required to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in step one  to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if these reporting units had been acquired on the date of the test 
we reviewed our long lived tangible and intangible assets within the impaired reporting units under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to these assets or asset groups were in excess of their carrying values and therefore these assets were not impaired 
see note  accounting policies and note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on long lived assets and impairment charges 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt and capital leases at june  were million and million and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates and would amount to a million increase in the fair value of long term debt as of june  we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding after taking into consideration the redemption of the remaining million of notes using borrowings on our revolving credit facility on july  at this borrowing level  assuming the variable rate debt was million at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to libor rates and us prime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arise from transactions including firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
we and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
our euro exposure is internally hedged for the most part because a high percentage of both the sales and costs at our steinfurt  germany plant are denominated in euros 
we do not have any hedges in place to protect against fluctuations in the canadian dollar 
we currently have a currency hedge agreement in place against the brazilian real 
our currency exposure to the brazilian real is approximately a million negative impact on profitability for every ten basis point strengthening of the real versus the us dollar 
we are continuously evaluating our foreign currency exposure and our hedging policy is subject to change 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the significant decline was due to the goodwill impairment loss recorded in the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
availability and cost of raw materials amounts paid by us for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of our variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond our control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber  to the extent not reflected in prices for our products  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
at the beginning of  we had raw material availability issues in our specialty cotton fibers business in both north america and brazil 
currently  our production is not constrained by raw material availability  but is constrained by reduced demand for our specialty cotton fiber products 
commodities we are dependent on commodities in our production process 
natural gas  electricity  fuel oil  caustic and other chemicals are just some of the commodities that our processes rely upon 
exposure to these commodities can have a significant impact on our operating performance 
in may  we entered into a seven year electrical power contract for power usage in brazil 
this contract bypasses the local utility company thereby reducing our energy costs by approximately million each year 
in order to minimize market exposure  we may use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of fossil fuels over a period of generally less than one year 
as of june  we had contracts in place to purchase  million btus of natural gas at various fixed prices through may at june  we had no commodity hedges in place 
exposure to commodity products also creates volatility in pricing 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp and other commodity products  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
industry cyclicality the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose based products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
it is not certain that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements  including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions  such as emissions of greenhouse gases  and general permitting requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
we also expect that we will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
any failure on our part to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to penalties or other sanctions that could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we cannot currently assess  however  the impact that more stringent environmental requirements may have on our operations or capital expenditure requirements
