item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for further discussion on our debt 
the non renewal  modification  or cancellation of affiliation agreements with major television networks  including our affiliation agreements with abc television network for komo and katu  could harm our operating results 
each of our television stations affiliation with one of the major television networks has a significant impact on the composition of the station s programming  revenue  expenses and operations 
in some instances  network affiliation agreements are not renewed  or in limited circumstances  may be cancelled by the network 
for example  if a network acquires a television station in a market in which we own a station affiliated with that network  the network will likely decline to renew the affiliation agreement for our station in that market 
our two largest television stations  komo  which broadcasts in seattle  washington  and katu  which broadcasts in portland  oregon  have affiliation agreements with abc with current terms expiring in august while we expect to renew such affiliation agreements prior to expiration  there can be no assurances that we will do so at all  or on terms that are beneficial to the company 
in  approximately percent of our television broadcasting revenues and approximately of our total revenues were derived from our two abc affiliated stations 
consequently  if we are unable to renew our abc affiliation agreements  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the major network affiliations for our television stations other than komo and katu are with cbs or fox 
our affiliation agreements with cbs generally expire in february our only affiliation agreement with the fox network generally expires in june although none of our affiliation agreements with cbs or fox are scheduled for renewal in  any modification  cancellation or eventual non renewal of any of these agreements could harm our operating results 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short term and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include the following increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  costs of building a new or larger news operation and other increases in station programming costs  if necessary  and the cost of equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major network s audience share and the fact that national network audience ratings are not necessarily indicative of how a network s programming is accepted in an individual market 
changes in fcc regulations regarding ownership have increased the uncertainty surrounding the competitive position of our stations in the markets we serve 
in june  the fcc relaxed certain of its local media ownership rules  including its local television ownership limitations and its prohibition on common ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market 
it also modified its local radio ownership limitations in a way that could limit our ability to acquire additional radio stations in existing markets that we serve 
the fcc s new rules were to have become effective on september  but were stayed by the us court of appeals for the third circuit 
then  in june  the court remanded the new rules to the fcc with instructions to undertake additional analysis of the record in order to justify its decision 
in september the third circuit court lifted its stay insofar as it applied to the modified local radio ownership rules  which are largely in effect 
in all other respects the rules that were in effect prior to june will remain in effect until the appeals are resolved or the stay is lifted 
in a remand order released in february  the fcc liberalized its broadcast newspaper cross ownership rule 
because the us court of appeals for the third circuit stayed the effectiveness of any modifications to the ownership rules until it reviews the fcc s compliance with its june order  the modified broadcast newspaper rule will not go into effect until the court has completed its review 
in its order  the fcc declined to modify its other ownership rules  including the local television ownership limitations 
a number of media companies and public interest groups have challenged the fcc s modification of the broadcast newspaper cross ownership rule and its retention of the other ownership rules 
these challenges are pending before the us court of appeals for the third circuit 
several public interest groups also have asked the fcc to reconsider its february order  and that request is pending 
we cannot predict the outcome of these challenges or the effect that any particular outcome will have on our stations and business 
under existing law a single entity is permitted to have an attributable interest in television stations serving up to of us television households 
large broadcast groups may take advantage of this law to expand further their ownership interests on a national basis 
we expect that the consolidation of ownership of broadcasting and newspapers in the hands of a smaller number of competitors would intensify the competition in our markets  which could harm our future operating results 
the fcc s extensive regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our ability to own and operate television and radio stations and other media outlets 
the broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act of  as amended 
compliance with and the effects of existing and future regulations could have a material adverse impact on us 
issuance  renewal or transfer of broadcast station operating licenses requires fcc approval  and we cannot operate our stations without fcc licenses 
except for katu  discussed below  fcc licenses for our various television and radio stations expire in  or failure to observe fcc rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including monetary forfeitures  the grant of short term ie  less than the full eight years license renewals or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or revocation of a license 
while the majority of such licenses are renewed by the fcc  we cannot assure you that our licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates  or  if renewed  that the renewal terms will be for eight years 
if the fcc decides to include conditions or qualifications in any of our licenses  we may be limited in the manner in which we may operate the affected stations 
on december   a petition to deny was filed by oregon alliance to reform media oarm against katu and seven other television stations licensed to serve the portland  oregon market 
oarm argued that the stations each failed to present adequate programming relating to state and local elections during the election cycle in their news and public affairs programming 
the fcc s media bureau rejected oarm s petition 
however  on september   oarm petitioned the fcc for reconsideration of that decision 
that petition remains pending  and we cannot predict when or how the fcc will address it 
the communications act and fcc rules impose specific limits on the number of stations and other media outlets an entity can own in a single market 
the fcc attributes interests held by  among others  such entity s officers  directors  certain stockholders  and in some circumstances  lenders  to that entity for purposes of applying these ownership limitations 
the ownership rules may prevent us from acquiring additional stations in a particular market 
we may also be prevented from engaging in a swap transaction if the swap would cause the other company to violate these rules 
we may further be prevented from implementing certain joint operations with competitors which might make the operation of our stations more efficient 
federal legislation and fcc rules have changed significantly in recent years and can be expected to continue to change 
these changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may thereby affect our operating results 
we will be required to make additional investments in dtv technology  which could harm our ability to fund other operations or repay debt 
although nearly all of our stations are operating within their fcc technical requirements  there are several exceptions 
kval and kcby will be transitioning back to their analog channels and work is nearing completion to accomplish these conversions 
kima  klew and kbci are currently operating at power levels or antenna heights less than that in their fcc allocations 
kima and kbci applied to increase transmission power during an fcc filing window in june  and kbci has completed the first phase of that power increase 
klew continues to operate at a reduced antenna height pursuant to an fcc granted special temporary authorization pending the analog shut down 
the analog antenna can then be removed and the digital antenna repositioned to the top of the tower 
we applied to change kunp s digital channel to that of the analog channel and flash cut to digital operation when analog operation ceases 
this application was granted by the fcc 
additionally  during the fcc filing window in june  komo  kpic  kepr  and kidk filed applications to maximize coverage by relocating their digital antennas to the top of their towers once the analog antennas can be removed and for the relocation of kuns to the komo transmitter site 
during a filing window for low power stations in august kunw and kvvk either applied for or modified existing construction permits for digital transmissions 
these additional digital broadcasting investments by some of our stations could result in less cash being available to fund other aspects of our business or repay our debt 
if we are unable to secure or maintain carriage of our television stations signals over cable and or direct broadcast satellite systems  our television stations may not be able to compete effectively 
pursuant to fcc rules  local television stations may elect every three years to either require cable and or direct broadcast satellite operators to carry the stations signals or enter into retransmission consent negotiations for carriage 
on or before october   consistent with fcc rules  each of our television stations sent notices to each of the cable systems in its market electing retransmission consent status for the period from january  through december  failure to reach timely retransmission consent agreements with the relevant cable operators may harm our business 
there is no assurance that we will be able to agree on terms acceptable to us  which could lead to reduction in our cable earnings 
some of our television stations are located in markets in which direct to home satellite operators are distributing local television signals to their subscribers local into local 
television stations in such markets have the opportunity to elect must carry or retransmission consent status according to the same triennial cycle applicable to cable carriage  described above 
stations not sending such elections are deemed to have elected retransmission consent status  in which case the satellite operator may not retransmit that station s signal without the permission of the station after january  we have elected must carry status from satellite providers for some of our stations in certain markets for the election period ending december   and for our other stations  we have elected retransmission consent status 
our stations in local into local markets are presently being carried by directv  one of the two major direct to home satellite operators pursuant to an existing retransmission consent agreement 
failure to reach agreement with directv prior to the expiration of the existing contract may harm our business 
there is no assurance that we will be able to agree on terms acceptable to us prior to the contract s expiration date 
our retransmission consent agreement with the other major direct to home satellite operator  dish network  expired on december  as a result  our television stations have not been carried by dish network since december we continue to be in talks with dish network to reach an agreement that will allow our stations to return to dish network 
however  there can be no assurance as to the timing or terms of any such agreement or whether  in fact  an agreement will be reached 
until we reach an agreement with dish network  our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected  possibly materially 
dependence on key personnel may expose us to additional risks 
our business is dependent on the performance of certain key employees  including executive officers and senior operational personnel 
we do not enter into employment agreements with most of our key executive officers and senior operational personnel 
we also employ several on air personalities who have significant loyal audiences in their respective markets  with whom we have entered into employment agreements 
we cannot assure you that all such key personnel or on air personalities will remain with us or that our on air personalities will renew their contracts 
the loss of any key personnel could harm our operations and financial results 
failure of our information technology systems would disrupt our operations  which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue 
our computer systems are vulnerable to viruses  unauthorized tampering  system failures and potential obsolescence 
our operations depend on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers and computer systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
our computer systems are also subject to potential system failures and obsolescence 
any of these events could cause system interruption  delays and loss of critical data that would adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers 
our recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
our ownership and operation of fisher plaza is subject to risks  including those relating to the economic climate  local real estate conditions  potential inability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  potential collection problems  reliance on significant tenants  and regulatory risks 
revenue and operating income from  and the value of  fisher plaza may be adversely affected by the general economic climate  the seattle economic climate and real estate conditions  including prospective tenants perceptions of attractiveness of the property and the availability of space in other competing properties 
in addition  the economic conditions in the telecommunications and high tech sectors may significantly affect our ability to attract tenants to fisher plaza  because space at fisher plaza is marketed in significant part to organizations from these sectors 
other risks relating to the operation of fisher plaza include the potential inability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and the potential inability to collect rent  due to bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise  especially in light of the current difficult economic environment 
we also risk facing lower rents due to the current economic downturn and abundance of available commercial space in downtown seattle 
real estate income and values may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws and regulations  including tax and environmental laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rent loss insurance with respect to fisher plaza 
there are  however  certain losses that may be either uninsurable  not economically insurable  or in excess of our current insurance coverage limits 
if an uninsured loss occurs with respect to fisher plaza  it could harm our operating results 
we are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting  if identified in future periods  could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules  we are required to furnish a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as part of our annual report on form k 
our independent registered public accountants are required to audit and provide a separate opinion on their evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting 
to issue our report  we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion  and then we test and evaluate the results 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses  if any  that may be identified in future periods  or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement 
if we or our independent registered public accountants discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
we may not be able to effectively and timely implement necessary control changes and employee training to ensure continued compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and other regulatory and reporting requirements 
there likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel  especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies 
our operations may be adversely affected by earthquakes and other natural catastrophes in the pacific northwest or california 
our corporate headquarters  fisher plaza and the majority of our operations are located in the pacific northwest and we own two television stations in california 
the pacific northwest and california have from time to time experienced earthquakes 
we do not know the ultimate impact on our operations of being located near major earthquake faults  but an earthquake could harm our operating results 
our broadcasting towers may also be affected by other natural catastrophes  such as forest fires 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural catastrophes

item management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions 
words such as may  could  would  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are based on our current expectations and projections about future events  are not guarantees of future performance  are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions including those described herein and apply only as of the date of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled risk factors as well as those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion is intended to provide an analysis of significant trends and material changes in our financial position and operating results during the period through overview we are an integrated media company 
we own and operate full power including a owned television station and seven low power television stations and eight radio stations 
our television and radio stations are located in washington  oregon  idaho  california and montana 
we also own and operate fisher plaza  a mixed use commercial facility located near downtown seattle that serves as the home for our corporate offices and our seattle television and radio stations  and also houses a variety of unaffiliated companies  including media and communications companies 
our broadcasting operations receive revenue from the sale of local  regional and national advertising and  to a much lesser extent  from network compensation  satellite and fiber transmission services  tower rental and commercial production activities 
our operating results are therefore sensitive to broad economic trends that affect the broadcasting industry in general  as well as local and regional trends  particularly those affecting the pacific northwest economy 
excluding revenue derived from seasonal sports rights  the advertising revenue of our stations is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring  and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during national election years due to spending by political candidates and advocacy groups 
this political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
our television revenue is significantly affected by network affiliation and the success of programming offered by those networks 
our two largest television stations komo tv and katu tv  which account for approximately percent of our television broadcasting revenue  are affiliated with the abc television network 
nine of our television stations are affiliated with the cbs television network including a owned television station  one of our television stations is affiliated with the fox television network  two of our television stations are independent  and the remainder of our television stations are affiliated with univision 
our broadcasting operations are subject to competitive pressures from traditional broadcasting sources  as well as from alternative methods of delivering information and entertainment  and these pressures may cause fluctuations in operating results 
in addition to our broadcasting operations  we own and operate fisher plaza  and we lease space to other companies that are attracted by the property location and the infrastructure provided at this facility 
as of december   approximately of fisher plaza was occupied or committed for occupancy was occupied by fisher entities  compared to occupied or committed for occupancy at december  was occupied by fisher entities 
revenue and operating income from fisher plaza are dependent upon the general us economic climate  and the seattle economic climate in particular  the outlook of the telecommunications and technology sectors and real estate conditions  including the availability of space in other competing properties 
management focuses on key metrics from operational data within our broadcasting and fisher plaza operations 
information on significant trends is provided in the section entitled consolidated results of operations 
significant developments the following significant developments affect the comparability of our financial statements for the months ended december   and goodwill and intangibles impairment 
we conduct our annual impairment review in october 
given the rapid economic deterioration and significant decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter  we conducted an additional interim assessment at year end 
based on this interim review we recorded a goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge of million as of december  excluding the million impairment of investment in equity investee 
please refer to note in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of several key assumptions used in the fair value estimate of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill during our fourth quarter interim impairment test 
investment in equity investee impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of an impairment review  we recorded an impairment charge of million on the investment in equity investee 
as such  we recorded total impairments of million in special dividend 
on july  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share on our common stock  which was paid on august  to shareholders of record on august  the dividend amount was million in the aggregate 
sale of safeco corporation shares 
in june  we sold  shares of safeco corporation common stock  which represented of our total safeco corporation holdings 
the shares were sold at an average price of per share  resulting in pre tax net proceeds of million 
the book basis of the shares sold totaled  resulting in a pre tax gain on sale of million 
in july  we sold our remaining  shares of safeco corporation common stock 
the shares were sold at an average price of per share  resulting in pre tax net proceeds of million 
the book basis of the shares sold totaled  resulting in a pre tax gain on sale of million 
the pre tax gain on sales of million is included in other income  net 
expiration of seattle mariners radio rights agreement 
in may  we entered into a radio rights agreement the rights agreement to broadcast seattle mariners baseball games on komo am for the through baseball seasons 
the impact of the rights agreement was greater during periods that included the broadcast of mariners baseball games 
accordingly  the impact on the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year was less than for the second and third quarters of the calendar year 
in july  we announced that we would not renew the rights agreement with the seattle mariners 
therefore  the season was the final year of our commitments under this agreement 
all commitments under the rights agreement have been satisfied 
termination of national advertising representation agreement 
in april  we terminated the agreement with our national advertising representation firm 
the successor firm will satisfy our contractual termination obligation to the predecessor firm with no cash payment made by the company 
in the second quarter of  we recognized a non cash termination charge of million to selling  general and administrative expenses and will amortize the resulting liability as a non cash benefit over the five year term of the new agreement 
in addition  we recognized a non cash benefit of million to selling  general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of  representing the remaining unamortized balance of our non cash charge resulting from the termination of our national advertising representation agreement 
purchase of bakersfield  california television stations 
on january  we completed the purchase of the assets of two television stations in the bakersfield  california designated market area dma kbak tv and kbfx ca  for million in cash 
option to purchase television stations 
in november  we finalized the purchase of two oregon television stations kunp and kunp lp for million in cash 
the purchase agreement  as amended  included an option to purchase one to three additional television stations in the northwest 
in june  after finalizing our evaluation of various acquisition alternatives  we determined that we would not exercise the option to purchase additional stations 
accordingly  we recognized a million charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of for the forfeiture of the non refundable option payment 
sale of radio stations 
in october  we completed the sale of of small market radio stations located in montana and eastern washington for million 
the sale of one additional montana station to the same buyer closed in june  for million 
the remaining five stations had continued to be actively marketed and held for sale until the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we determined that in view of the uncertainty around the timing or probability of a sale of the remaining five stations  the requirements of sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets necessary to classify the remaining five radio stations as discontinued operations were no longer met and that it was appropriate to present the stations as held for use in our continuing operations as of the fourth quarter of and going forward 
the assets and liabilities of the five stations have been classified as held for use in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   and the results of operations of the five stations through december  have been classified as continuing operations in our radio segment in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including  but not limited to  those affecting revenues  goodwill and intangibles impairment  the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables and broadcast rights  stock based compensation expense  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes and liabilities and contingencies 
the brief discussion below is intended to highlight some of the judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them  as presented in this annual report 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
approximately million or of our total assets as of december  consisted of unamortized goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of certain media properties over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired and is accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
indefinite lived intangible assets include broadcast licenses primarily fcc licenses 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
the impairment test for fcc licenses consists of a station by station comparison of the carrying amount of fcc licenses with their fair value  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the impairment step for goodwill utilizes a two step fair value approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the combined stations in a market reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing an assumed purchase price allocation  using the reporting unit s fair value as determined in step as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment loss of million for our goodwill and intangible assets primarily broadcasting licenses 
as of december   our total market capitalization was million greater than our equity book value 
we believe this difference can be attributed to the recent volatility of our stock price in the current economic environment and to the control premium that a market participant may pay in the event we were acquired 
from the end of until the date of this filing  our market capitalization has decreased significantly 
since significant reduction in market capitalization is one of the key trigger events for us to conduct an interim goodwill and intangible assets impairment review  we could recognize further impairments in future quarters on the approximately million of goodwill and intangibles currently included in our total assets 
we believe our estimate of the value of our goodwill and broadcasting licenses is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
please refer to note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of several key assumptions used in the fair value estimate of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill during our fourth quarter interim impairment test 
tangible long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we use our judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors we consider which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and significant negative cash flows or industry trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is primarily based on market transactions for comparable businesses  discounted cash flows  and a review of the underlying assets of the reporting unit 
in estimating these future cash flows  we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and that were expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these projections rely on significant assumptions 
if it is determined that a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
changes in any of our estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and could result in a future impairment of the involved assets with a material effect on our future results of operations 
television and radio broadcast rights 
television and radio broadcast rights are recorded as assets when the license period begins and the programs are available for broadcast  at the gross amount of the related obligations or  for non sports first run programming  at the amount of the annual obligation 
costs incurred in connection with the purchase of programs to be broadcast within one year are classified as current assets  while costs of those programs to be broadcast after one year are considered non current 
these programming costs are charged to operations over their estimated broadcast periods using either the straight line method or in proportion to estimated revenue of the related program 
program obligations are classified as current or non current in accordance with the payment terms of the license agreement 
we periodically assess net realizable value for our capitalized broadcast rights  in which we compare estimated future revenues on a program by program basis to the carrying value of the related asset 
impairments  if any  are charged to programming expenses in the period of the impairment 
revenue recognition 
television and radio revenue is recognized when the advertisement is broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
rentals from real estate leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  while revenue from related service fees is recognized when the services are delivered 
pensions 
we maintain a noncontributory supplemental retirement program that was established for key management 
no new participants have been admitted to this program since and the benefits of active participants were frozen in the program provides for vesting of benefits under certain circumstances 
funding is not required  but generally we have acquired annuity contracts and life insurance on the lives of the individual participants to assist in payment of retirement benefits 
we are the owner and beneficiary of such policies 
accordingly  the cash values of the policies as well as the accrued liability are reported in the financial statements 
the program requires continued employment or disability through the date of expected retirement 
the cost of the program is recognized over the participants average expected future lifetime 
the cost of this program is reported and accounted for in accordance with accounting rules that require significant assumptions regarding such factors as discount rates 
we use actuarial consulting services to assist in estimating the supplemental retirement obligation and related periodic expenses 
the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was at december   and at december  the rate of increase in future compensation was no longer applicable at december  or due to freezing plan benefits for active participants 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results could differ from our estimates 
changes in benefits provided by us may also affect future plan costs 
income taxes 
the determination of our provision of income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover some or all our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  and are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of our deferred tax assets not considered recoverable 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant management judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in expectations and actual future results could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient state taxable income to realize our deferred state tax assets  a valuation allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes 
the valuation allowance was million and  at december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had utilized all of our prior year federal net operating losses 
our federal and state income tax returns are subject to periodic examination  and the tax authorities may challenge certain of our tax positions as a result of examinations 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the tax authorities could require us to make additional tax payments 
valuation allowances are established when we determine that there exists significant uncertainty that we will realize our deferred tax assets 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january  the adoption of fin did not impact our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are sometimes ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make certain subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
accordingly  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
we believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded for the years ended december  and pursuant to fin allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on factors such as our historical experience of bad debts as a percent of past due balances for each business unit  as well as changes in current economic conditions 
variable interest entities 
we may enter into joint sales agreements jsas or local marketing agreements lmas with non owned stations 
under the terms of these agreements  we make specific periodic payments to the station s owner operator in exchange for the right to provide programming and or sell advertising on a portion of the station s broadcast time 
nevertheless  the owner operator retains control and responsibility for the operation of the station  including responsibility over all programming broadcast on the station 
generally  we continue to operate the station under the agreement until the termination of such agreement 
as a result of these agreements  we may determine that the station is a variable interest entity vie as defined by the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and that we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest 
this typically occurs if we also have an agreement to acquire a station and the conditions to close are considered to be perfunctory 
we also may determine that a station is a vie in connection with other types of local service agreements entered into with stations in markets in which we own and operate a station 
we did not have any vie s in or stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock option awards 
our determination of the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected life of the award  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  forfeitures  and projected exercise behaviors 
although the fair value of stock option awards is determined in accordance with sfas r  the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
consolidated results of operations we report financial data for three reportable segments television  radio and fisher plaza 
the television segment includes the operations of our owned and operated network affiliated television stations including a owned television station and internet business 
the radio segment includes the operations of our three seattle radio stations and five radio stations in montana 
corporate expenses of the broadcasting business unit are allocated to the television and radio reportable segments based on actual expenditures incurred or based on a ratio that approximates historic revenue and operating expenses of the segments 
the fisher plaza segment consists of the operations of fisher plaza 
fisher owned entities that reside at fisher plaza do not pay rent 
however  these entities do pay common area maintenance expenses 
the segmental data includes additional allocation of depreciation and certain operating expenses from fisher plaza to the seattle based television and radio segments

comparison of fiscal years ended december   december   and december  revenue television revenue increased in as compared to  primarily due to increased political advertising offset by a decrease in non political national and local advertising revenue due to overall weak advertising demand in the economic downturn 
the acquisition of our two bakersfield  california television stations in january contributed million in additional television revenue for the year ended december  revenues from our abc affiliated stations were relatively flat for the year ended december   as compared to  due primarily to increases in political advertising offset by weak demand in non political national and local advertising 
revenues from our cbs affiliated stations increased over the same period  excluding the addition of our bakersfield cbs station due to weak demand in non political national and local advertising at our other cbs stations 
in may  we signed agreements with abc to renew the network s affiliation at komo tv in seattle and katu tv in portland through august in january  we also renewed affiliation agreements with cbs through february the terms of the renewals include decreasing network compensation which we recognize on a straight line basis over the term of the agreements 
television network compensation revenue was approximately million in each of  and in november  we entered into affiliation agreements with univision for our spanish language television stations for terms extending into television revenue increased in as compared to  primarily due to the acquisition of spanish language television stations late in these stations contributed million in additional television revenue for the year ended december  in addition  revenues from our growing internet business which is included in our television segment have increased 
revenues from our abc affiliated stations decreased for the year ended december   as compared to  due primarily to lower political advertising  partially offset by increases in non political national and local advertising 
revenues from our cbs affiliated stations increased over the same period  due primarily to increased non political local and national advertising 
radio revenue decreased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of a decline in local advertising revenue and in revenue attributed to our broadcasting of seattle mariners baseball games 
as discussed above  the season was the last year of our broadcasting of seattle mariners baseball games 
excluding revenue specifically attributable to our mariners broadcast agreement  radio revenue decreased for the year ended december   as compared to we attribute the decrease to weak demand for non political revenues across all categories 
revenue and expenses from our small market great falls  montana radio operations have been included in the regular operations of the radio segment as we no longer consider them held for sale 
this change has been reflected in the prior year comparisons as well 
radio revenue increased in as compared to  primarily as a result of increases in non political national advertising 
excluding revenue specifically attributable to our broadcasting of mariners baseball games  radio revenue increased in  as compared to we attribute this increase to improved ratings and a growth in national market share 
revenue and expenses from our small market great falls  montana radio operations have been included in the regular operations of the radio segment as we no longer consider them held for sale 
the revenue increases at fisher plaza in and as compared to the prior years  were due primarily to increased rental and service fees  as well as increased electrical infrastructure fees  parking garage fees and tenant reimbursements 
occupancy levels have increased at fisher plaza over the past three years  and recurring third party rental and service revenues have also increased 
fisher plaza occupancy was as of december  and  and as of december  direct operating costs direct operating costs are expenses required to produce and promote broadcast programming for the television and radio segments and costs to operate fisher plaza 
many of these costs are relatively fixed in nature and do not necessarily vary on a proportional basis with revenue 
the increase in direct operating costs for the television segment in as compared to was primarily the result of expenses associated with operating our new bakersfield television stations  as well as increased promotional spending 
in addition  expenses rose as we invested in our television news product and incurred news costs associated with our growing internet business 
the increase in direct operating costs for the television segment in compared to was primarily the result of costs associated with operating our spanish language television stations  as well as increased promotional expenses 
expenses also increased because we invested in our television news product and incurred news costs associated with our growing internet business 
increased direct operating costs at our radio segment for as compared to and for as compared to were primarily due to increased labor costs 
the increase in direct operating costs at fisher plaza in as compared to was primarily attributable to increased property taxes  maintenance costs and utilities expenses 
the increase in direct operating costs in as compared to was primarily attributable to increased property taxes and utilities expenses 
the corporate and eliminations category consists primarily of the reclassification and elimination of certain operating expenses between operating segments 
for example  komo tv and seattle radio recognize facilities related expenses as selling  general and administrative  while fisher plaza records the reimbursement of these intercompany expenses as a reduction of direct operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the television segment in as compared to was due primarily to the addition of our two bakersfield stations  as well as an increase in commissions  market research and development expenses and selling costs associated with our growing internet business 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was due primarily to the addition of the spanish language stations  and an increase in commissions  market research and development expenses and selling costs associated with our growing internet business 
broadcasters may periodically terminate existing agreements with national advertising representation firms  under such circumstances  the successor firm generally satisfies the broadcaster s contractual termination obligation to the predecessor firm with no cash payment made by the broadcaster 
when we terminate national advertising representation agreements with contractual termination penalties  we record a non cash charge to selling  general and administrative expense and amortize the resulting liability over the term of the new agreement 
based on this policy  we recognized a non cash charge of approximately million in the second quarter of and will recognize a non cash benefit on a straight line basis over the five year term of the new contract 
selling  general and administrative expenses at our radio segment in were flat compared to the increase in as compared to was due primarily to mariners merchandising expense and commissions 
total selling  general and administrative expenses at fisher plaza increased in as compared to due primarily to costs incurred to market the fisher plaza during the summer of as of december   approximately of fisher plaza was occupied or committed for occupancy at december  and at december  and  consequently  broad based selling and marketing initiatives have been reduced 
the corporate group incurred higher selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to  due primarily to a million non cash charge for the forfeiture of a non refundable option payment related to our decision not to exercise an option to acquire additional television stations  as well as increased legal and professional services fees  retirement plan costs and stock based compensation  partially offset by reduced incentive compensation 
the corporate group incurred higher selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to  due primarily to higher legal and professional services fees  compensation and payroll related expenses and stock based compensation  partially offset by reductions in severance and recruiting costs 
amortization of program rights amortization of program rights for the television segment increased in as compared to  due primarily to our acquisition of the two bakersfield television stations 
amortization of program rights for the radio segment are related the agreement to broadcast seattle mariners baseball games  which increased slightly in  as compared to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of that included a million impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses  related to five of the company s television stations and two of the company s radio stations  a  impairment to the carrying value of a network affiliation agreement  related to one of the company s television stations  and a million impairment to the carrying values of goodwill  related to six reporting units consisting of of the company s television stations and five of the company s radio stations 
as required by sfas  the company tested its fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment at december   between the annual impairment tests  because the company believed events had occurred and circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company s reporting units below their carrying amounts and that the company s fcc licenses might be impaired 
these events included a the decline of the price of the company s common stock as of december   b the deterioration in overall economic conditions  and c the decline in advertising revenues at the company s radio and television stations 
impairment of investment in equity investee we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of on the investment in equity investee as part of our fourth quarter impairment review 
as such  we recorded total impairments of million in depreciation and amortization depreciation for all segments except fisher plaza increased in as compared to  due primarily to significant television broadcast and information technology additions in depreciation for the fisher plaza segment declined in as compared to  primarily as a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
depreciation for all segments increased in as compared to  due primarily to significant television broadcast and fisher plaza asset additions in late other income  net other income  net  includes a gain on the sale of marketable securities  dividends received on marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  interest and miscellaneous income received 
the significant increase in as compared to was due primarily to the june and july sales of our remaining million shares of safeco corporation common stock  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
the significant increase in as compared to was due primarily to the december sale of  shares of safeco common stock  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in addition  a portion of the increase was due to an increase in the dividend rate on our investment in safeco shares prior to our sale of the shares 
interest expense  net interest expense  net consists primarily of interest on our senior notes  amortization of loan fees  and interest on borrowings under our former million senior credit facility 
the increase in interest expense in as compared to was due primarily to interest expense related to borrowings on our million senior credit facility  which we terminated in december this increase in interest expense included the  in unamortized transaction costs charged to expense upon our termination of the credit facility 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was due primarily to interest expense related to uncertain tax positions and borrowings on our million senior credit facility in this borrowing facilitated the purchase of three television stations in oregon and washington in provision benefit for federal and state income taxes our effective tax increased to in as compared to in due primarily to an increase in permanent differences 
our effective tax rate is calculated on the statutory rate of being increased or decreased for estimated permanent differences  including dividend deductions and non deductible expenses  and changes in discrete or other non recurring items  including federal or state tax audit adjustments 
in we recognized additional federal income tax expense of  as a result of irs examinations of prior year tax returns 
our effective tax rate in increased to from the effective tax rate in the increase in tax rate was due primarily to increase in permanent differences and irs audit adjustments 
in we recognized additional federal income tax expense of  as a result of irs examinations of prior year tax returns 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient state taxable income to realize our deferred state tax assets  a valuation allowance has been established for these deferred tax assets 
as a result  our effective tax rate is not affected by changes in the state tax rates 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes the loss from discontinued operations in was related primarily to our sale of pegasus news  inc in december we sold pegasus news for a net after tax loss of  in addition  we recognized an after tax loss of  upon final settlement of a dispute related to the sale of small market radio stations in the income from discontinued operations in was related to the operations of pegasus news  in addition to the small market radio stations which we sold in  and is presented net of income taxes 
in june  we closed the sale of one of these radio stations and recognized a gain on sale of million  net of tax 
in october  we closed the sale of of these stations and recognized a gain on sale of million  net of tax 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our liquidity is primarily dependent upon our net cash from operating activities and short term investments 
our net cash from operating activities is sensitive to many factors  including changes in working capital and the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures 
working capital at any specific point in time is dependent upon many variables  including operating results  receivables  capital expenditures  the timing of cash receipts and payments 
the extensive weakening of the us economy and tightening investment and credit markets has had a significant impact on advertising spending by our customers in various categories 
if the current challenging general economic conditions continue  we believe that our revenue  cash flow from operations and net income will be negatively impacted and may decline from historical levels 
we expect cash flows from operations  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to provide sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements for operations  projected working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million as of december  compared to million as of december  in june and july  we sold our remaining  shares of safeco common stock 
the shares were sold at an average price of per share  resulting in pre tax net proceeds to the company of million 
our senior notes indenture contains provisions that limit our ability to distribute proceeds from asset sales  which includes the proceeds from the sale of our shares of safeco corporation common stock 
in the event that we do not use the proceeds from asset sales for qualifying purposes as specified in the indenture within days from the date of sale  we will be required to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes at par value to the extent of such unused proceeds the excess proceeds 
under the indenture  qualifying purposes include i repayment of secured indebtedness  ii purchase of assets used or useful in our business  iii certain acquisitions of other companies  iv expenditures used or useful in our business  and v certain investments in the company or our subsidiaries 
we expect that the company will have used all of the proceeds from the sale of safeco shares for qualifying purposes and therefore will not have any excess proceeds that would require us to offer to repurchase the notes 
on july  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share on our common stock  which was paid on august  to shareholders of record on august  the dividend amount was million in the aggregate 
in december  we terminated our senior credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the market risk in our financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in financial rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and securities prices 
these exposures are directly related to our normal funding and investing activities 
interest rate exposure as a result of our placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  substantially all of our debt as of december   is at a fixed rate 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million less than its carrying value 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and  as of december   amounted to approximately million 
fair market values are determined based on market quotes by brokers 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes do not impact book value  operations  or cash flows 
as of december   our fixed rate debt totaled million 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million more than its carrying value 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and  as of december   amounted to approximately million 
our short term investments are comprised of commercial paper with original maturities of greater than days but less than one year  and we have classified our short term investments as held to maturity 
the securities are carried at amortized cost using the specific identification method  and interest income is recorded using an effective interest rate with the associated discount amortized to interest income 
commercial paper prices are susceptible to changes in market interest rates 
however  the relatively short term nature of these investments minimizes interest rate risk 
our short term investments are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates do not affect the carrying value or interest income recognized 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a significant exposure to interest rate risk related to our short term investments 
as of december   our short term investments carrying value of million approximated fair value 
fair values for these instruments are estimated using best available evidence including broker quotes  prices for similar investments  interest rates and credit risk 
marketable securities exposure in we sold our remaining million shares of safeco corporation common stock 
our investment in safeco represented nearly all of our investments in marketable securities 
accordingly  our exposure to market risk in the area of securities prices was not significant as of december  as of december   the fair value of our investments in marketable securities  consisting primarily of million shares of safeco common stock  was million
