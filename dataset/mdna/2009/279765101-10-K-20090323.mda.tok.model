 unaudited revenue sources subscriptions data licenses advertising and e commerce total liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was for the year ended december   an improvement from net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  this was primarily due to continued increases in revenues and reduced operating expenses through continued cost control measures in the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  and included related to capital expenditures and in capitalized product development costs 
the capital expenditures were primarily for computers and equipment to support our expansion and increased infrastructure 
the capitalized product development costs primarily related to the continued development of our xbrl processing platform 
we expect capitalized product development costs to increase in future years as we continue the development of our xbrl processing platform 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was and related primarily to capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities of for the year ended december  consisted of the repayment of of notes payable  as described below  which was partially offset by proceeds from the exercises of stock options of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted of  of proceeds from notes payable and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants which were partially offset by of deferred financing costs 
on april   we entered into a financing agreement financing agreement with rosenthal rosenthal  inc rosenthal for additional working capital 
under the financing agreement  rosenthal made a term loan in the principal amount of  to us and has additionally agreed to provide up to an additional  under a revolving line of credit 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the financing agreement is payable at variable rates of interest over the published jpmorgan chase prime rate with a minimum prime rate of  on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our obligations under the term loan are evidenced by a secured term note and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we are required to maintain certain collateral ratios and financial covenants under the agreement 
on april   the ratios and covenants were amended effective as of december  on march   the ratios and covenants were further amended effective as of december  in addition  the maturity date was amended to march  and the renewal date was amended to march  we were in compliance with these ratios and covenants  as amended  at december  and we believe that we will be in compliance throughout the financing agreement  as amended  terminates on march  
table of contents unless sooner terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the financing agreement 
in connection with the financing agreement  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the closing date of the transaction to rosenthal 
the warrant expires on april  also in connection with this transaction  we paid our financial advisor  which represents of the gross principal amount of the term loan and of the gross principal amount of the revolving credit 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of  we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we may also consider such financings prior to such time if conditions suggest engaging in such a financing would be advantageous to us 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
our future contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest operating lease obligations severance agreements total critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we derive revenues from three primary sources subscriptions to our web services  data licenses and solutions and advertising and other e commerce based revenues 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically twelve months 
revenue from data licenses is recognized over the term of the contract 
our data solutions sometimes involve some upfront one time customization fees  along with more traditional annual data licensing arrangements for the ongoing delivery of the data solution 
in addition  some of our data solutions are billed on a time and materials basis  per service level agreements or for delivery of data 
upfront customization fees are recorded systematically over the expected customer relationship period 
we review each contract in connection with the respective governing accounting literature to determine revenue recognition on a case by case basis 
revenue from time and materials based agreements and data delivery is recognized as the data and services are provided 
advertising and e commerce revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is recognized provided acceptance and delivery  if applicable  has occurred  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
if amounts are received in advance of the services being performed  the amounts are recorded and presented as deferred revenues 
revenue is recognized net of any related state sales taxes charged and sales taxes payable are included in accrued expenses 

table of contents several of our accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectability of accounts receivable  the estimated useful lives and fair values of intangible assets and the estimated fair value of goodwill 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product  or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
our evaluation is based primarily on market capitalization as we have only one reporting unit 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized 
we recognize compensation expense for all employee and director stock based compensation awards based on estimated grant date fair values 
we estimate the fair value using the black scholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options  stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend yields 
we recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adopting sfas r  we estimated expected forfeitures over the life of each individual award and included the impact of these expected forfeitures in stock based compensation expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued fsp partial deferral of the effective date of statement fsp 
fsp delays the effective date of fas  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas revised and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas revised requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date  with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired 
this standard also requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies 
sfas revised applies prospectively to business combinations and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the impact that sfas revised will have on our consolidated financial statements when effective will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions  if any  completed after the effective date as well as the accounting for income taxes on prior acquisitions 
sfas requires that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated net income should include the net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of income 
the calculation of earnings per share will continue to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent 
the presentation provisions of sfas are to be applied retrospectively  and sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we generally invest in short term  low risk instruments 
we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
we experience changes in interest expense when market interest rates change as interest on our debt is calculated as over the published jpmorgan chase prime rate  with a minimum prime rate of 
we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
currency rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the us dollar 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments
