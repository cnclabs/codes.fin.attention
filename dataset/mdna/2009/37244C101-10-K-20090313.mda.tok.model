item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
business overview we are a life science company focused on the development and commercialization of genomic based clinical diagnostic tests for cancer that allow physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions 
our diagnostic test  oncotype dx  is used for breast cancer patients to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit and is conducted at our clinical reference laboratory in redwood city  california 
effective july   we increased the list price of our test from  to  substantially all of our historical revenues have been derived from the sale of oncotype dx ordered by physicians in the united states 
adoption and reimbursement for the year ended december   more than  test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning  compared to more than  and more than  test reports delivered for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   more than  tests had been delivered for use in treatment planning by more than  physicians 
we believe increased demand resulted from the inclusion of oncotype dx in the clinical practice guidelines of the american society of clinical oncologists  or asco  and the national comprehensive cancer network  or nccn  publication of peer reviewed articles on studies we sponsored  conducted or collaborated on that support the use and reimbursement of oncotype dx  clinical presentations at major symposia  and our ongoing commercial efforts 
however  this increased demand is not necessarily indicative of future demand  and we cannot assure you that this level of increased demand can be sustained or that publication of articles  future appearances or presentations at medical conferences or increased commercial efforts will have a similar impact on demand for oncotype dx 
we believe that each year we may experience slower demand for our test in the second and third calendar quarters  which may be attributed to physicians  surgeons and patients scheduling vacations during this time 
we depend upon third party payors to provide reimbursement for our test 
accordingly  we have focused substantial resources on obtaining reimbursement coverage from third party payors 
as of february  more than of all us insured lives were covered by health plans that provide reimbursement for oncotype dx for patients with n  er disease through contracts  agreements or policy decisions 

table of contents in order to enhance the clinical utility of oncotype dx  we introduced quantitative gene expression reporting for estrogen receptor  or er  and progesterone receptor  or pr  genes with the oncotype dx report in february and for the human epidermal growth factor receptor  or her  gene in september in the second half of  we experienced an increase in usage of oncotype dx for n patients 
while some payors provide coverage for the use of oncotype dx in patients with lymph node micrometastasis greater than mm  but not greater than mm in size  substantially all of our existing reimbursement coverage is limited to women with early stage n  er breast cancer 
we may not be able to obtain reimbursement coverage for oncotype dx for breast cancer patients with n  er disease 
our domestic sales  marketing and reimbursement efforts are focused on direct interaction with medical and surgical oncologists  pathologists and payors 
in january  we hired an additional us sales representatives  increasing our domestic sales force to a total of sales representatives 
we have also continued to expand internationally 
as of february  we had received test samples from countries  completed or initiated multiple international studies and established exclusive distribution agreements for oncotype dx with partners in eight countries outside of the us we established a subsidiary in geneva  switzerland in february and have appointed lead executives in europe and in asia to support our international efforts 
we do not expect international product revenues to comprise a significant portion of our total revenues for at least the next three years 
product pipeline we are investigating the utility of oncotype dx in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ  or dcis  which generally refers to a pre invasive tumor with reduced risk of recurrence 
we plan to evaluate the use of the oncotype dx gene panel and also seek to identify other genes that may be used for treatment planning in dcis 
we are also conducting studies of oncotype dx with clinical samples from breast cancer patients who were treated with aromatase inhibitors 
outside of breast cancer  we are conducting an independent clinical validation study in stage ii colon cancer for our gene colon cancer assay  utilizing more than  patient samples from an international trial which examined the benefit associated with fluorouracil leucovorin chemotherapy 
we anticipate reporting results of this validation study in the second half of we do not currently expect to commercialize a test for colon cancer until economic environment continuing concerns over inflation  deflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the federal stimulus plan  federal budget proposals  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence  a declining stock market and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic slowdown and recession 
we evaluated the impact of this environment on our cash management  cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments  and we expect that we will continue to be able to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities 
from time to time  we monitor the financial position of our significant third party payors  which include medicare and managed care companies 
as of the date of this report  we do not expect the current economic environment to have a material negative impact on our ability to collect payments from our third party payors in the foreseeable future 
the economic slowdown could negatively impact the volume of tests we deliver if patients lose healthcare coverage  delay medical checkups or are unable to pay for our test 
we intend to continue to assess the impact of the economic environment on our business activities 
if the economic climate in the us does not improve or continues to deteriorate  our cash position  cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered could be negatively impacted and we could experience lower revenues 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we exercise judgment in determining whether revenue is recognized on an accrual basis when test results are delivered or on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
our revenues for tests performed are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the nature of the fee charged for the products or services delivered and existing contractual agreements 
when evaluating collectibility  we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate a payor s individual payment patterns 
based upon at least several months of payment history  we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor s outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the contracted payment amount 
to the extent all criteria set forth above are not met  including where there is no evidence of payment history at the time test results are delivered  product revenues are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
contract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract specific basis 
under certain contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed 
we may exercise judgment when estimating full time equivalent level of effort  costs incurred and time to project completion 
for certain contracts  we utilize the performance based method of revenue recognition  which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a project then recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date 
the estimated total costs to be expended are necessarily subject to revision from time to time as the underlying facts and circumstances change 
allowance for doubtful accounts we accrue an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable based on estimates consistent with historical payment experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated quarterly and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
the year over year increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reflected the impact of moving several third party payors from a cash basis to an accrual basis 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities salaries and benefits  allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs  contract services and other outside costs  and costs to acquire in process research and development projects and technologies that have no alternative future use 
research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 

table of contents prior to january   we recognized non refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used for future research and development activities as an expense when payments were made 
beginning january   these payments are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for non refundable payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  or eitf as a result of our adoption of eitf  our research and development collaboration expenses and net loss decreased by  for the year ended december  our net loss per share decreased by for the year ended december  we expect to recognize these deferred and capitalized amounts as expense in future periods as the related services are delivered 
we enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses 
we record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms 
all potential future product programs outside of breast and colon cancer are in the research or early development phase 
the expected time frame in which a test for one of these other cancers can be brought to market is uncertain given the technical challenges and clinical variables that exist between different types of cancers 
in  we began maintaining information regarding costs incurred for activities performed under certain contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
however  we do not generally record or maintain information regarding costs incurred in research and development on a program specific basis 
our research and development staff and associated infrastructure resources are deployed across several programs 
many of our costs are thus not attributable to individual programs 
as a result  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development programs or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which addresses the accounting for stock based payment transactions whereby an entity receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments  including stock options 
under the provisions of sfas r  our employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the application of sfas r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions used in determining fair value 
the black scholes valuation method requires the use of estimates such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value stock based compensation 
as of january  our assumptions regarding expected volatility are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
prior to january  our assumptions regarding expected volatility were based primarily on comparable peer data because our common stock had been publicly traded for less than two years 
the expected life of options is estimated based on historical option exercise data and assumptions related to unsettled options 
expected option forfeiture rates are based on historical data  and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results 
as required under sfas r  we review our valuation assumptions on an ongoing basis  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
see note  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for more information 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and we recorded net loss for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents revenues we derive our revenues primarily from product sales and  to a lesser extent  from contract research arrangements 
we operate in one industry segment 
our product revenues are derived solely from the sale of our oncotype dx test 
payors are billed upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician 
product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or policy is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as contractual obligations are completed 
year ended december  in thousands product revenues contract revenues total revenues year over year dollar increase in product revenues year over year percentage increase in product revenues the year over year increases in product revenues resulted from increased adoption  as evidenced by a increase in test volume for compared to and a increase in test volume for compared to  expanded reimbursement coverage  resulting in increases in the amount paid per test  and increases in revenues recorded on an accrual basis 
approximately million  or  of product revenues for the year ended december  were recorded on an accrual basis and recognized at the time the test results were delivered  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively

for all periods  the balance of product revenues was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received 
product revenues from medicare payments for the year ended december  were million  or of product revenues  compared to million  or  and million  or  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
medicare revenue for the year ended december  included million of payments for services provided to medicare patients prior to medicare s february  effective coverage date for oncotype dx 
product revenues from united healthcare insurance company payments were million  or of product revenues  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of product revenues  for the year ended december  there were no product revenues from united healthcare insurance company payments for the year ended december  contract revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract revenues represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners 
the increase in contract revenues for compared to included the recognition of million in related to the completion of a contract 
the decrease in contract revenues for compared to was due to project timing for ongoing research and development collaboration activities 
we expect that our contract revenues will continue to fluctuate based on the number and timing of studies being conducted 

table of contents cost of product revenues year ended december  in thousands tissue sample processing costs employee stock based compensation total tissue sample processing costs license fees total cost of product revenues year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase cost of product revenues represents the cost of materials  direct labor  equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples including histopathology  anatomical pathology  paraffin extraction  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  or rt pcr  quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport tissue samples and license fees 
infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
costs associated with performing our test are recorded as tests are processed 
costs recorded for tissue sample processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues and fixed annual payments relating to the launch and commercialization of oncotype dx are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations 
license fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
test volume increased from to and from to  driving the million  or  and million  or  year over year increases in tissue sample processing costs 
the million  or  and million  or  year over year increases in license fees included higher royalties primarily driven by year over year increases in product revenues of and  respectively 
we expect the cost of product revenues to increase to the extent we process more tests 
research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation collaboration expenses reagents and laboratory supplies infrastructure and all other costs total research and development expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and carry out clinical studies and include personnel related expenses  reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work  infrastructure expenses  including allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs  contract services and other outside costs 
research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
the million increase in research and development expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses due primarily to an increase in headcount year over year  a 
table of contents million increase in stock based compensation and a  increase in costs incurred for reagents and laboratory supplies 
the million increase in research and development expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses due primarily to an increase in headcount year over year  a million increase in infrastructure expenses  including allocations for laboratory facilities expansion and improvements  a million increase in employee stock based compensation and a  increase in costs incurred for reagents and lab supplies 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we increase investment in our product pipeline for a variety of cancers  including cancers other than breast and colon 
selling and marketing expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation promotional and marketing materials travel  meetings and seminars infrastructure and all other costs total selling and marketing expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  education and promotional expenses associated with oncotype dx and infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
these expenses include the costs of educating physicians  laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding our genomic technologies  how our oncotype dx test was developed and validated and the value of the quantitative information that oncotype dx provides 
selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education  medical meeting participation and dissemination of our scientific and economic publications related to oncotype dx 
the million increase in selling and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  reflecting our investment in our field sales and support organization  a million increase in infrastructure and other expenses  including allocations for facilities expansion and improvements and medical affairs support for breast cancer product enhancements  a million increase in promotional field and marketing expense  a  increase in travel related expenses  primarily associated with field sales personnel  and a  increase in stock based compensation 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries and related expenses and  was attributable to higher commissions and bonus payments related to increased product revenues 
the million increase in selling and marketing expenses in compared to was due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  largely due to the expansion of our domestic field sales and support organization in the second half of  million in higher travel related expenses primarily associated with field sales personnel  a million increase in promotional field and marketing expense  a million increase in stock based compensation expense  and a million increase in infrastructure expenses  including facilities expansion and improvements 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries and related expenses  including the expansion of our domestic field sales force in july  and  million was attributable to higher commissions and bonus payments related to increased product revenues 
we expect that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our domestic field sales force and support organization and expand our commercial efforts in international 
table of contents markets 
in january  we hired an additional us sales representatives  increasing our domestic sales force by to a total of sales representatives 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation professional fees and all other costs total general and administrative expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses and professional fees and other costs  including legal fees  advisory and auditing expenses  billing and collection costs  bad debt expense and other professional and administrative costs and related infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses due primarily to an increase in headcount year over year  a million increase in bad debt expense related to growth in our aged accounts receivable balances  a million increase in billing and collections expense related to an increase in the number of tests processed and cash collected  a  increase in stock based compensation expense and a  increase in professional fees  due primarily to legal fees related to regulatory and other matters  and a  increase in infrastructure and related costs 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expense due primarily to an increase in headcount year over year  a million increase in stock based compensation and  in higher billing and collection fees paid to third party billing and collection vendors 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense due to changes in our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts  which resulted in a  credit to bad debt expense for the year ended december  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we hire additional staff and incur other expenses to support the growth of our business and to the extent we spend more on fees for billing and collections as we process more tests 
interest and other income interest and other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income for compared to reflected decreased interest income due to lower average cash and short term investment balances compared to the prior year  which reflected the investment of a portion of the proceeds from our may common stock offering  and lower market yields on our investments in the increase in interest and other income for compared to was due to increased interest income from higher average short term investment balances  resulting from our investment of a portion of the cash proceeds from our may public offering of common stock  and higher market yields on our investments in we expect our interest and other income may continue to decrease if the overall decline in the interest rate environment related to the current economic crisis continues 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we incur interest expense on our equipment financing established in march the  decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to lower 
table of contents average balances on these borrowings as we paid them down 
the  increase in interest expense in compared to was due to higher average balances on these borrowings reflecting draws made on our equipment financing line in january we expect our interest expense to decline as we continue to make payments on our equipment financing 
we do not anticipate using additional equipment financing as a funding source in the next twelve months 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will likely incur net losses for at least the next year 
however  we cannot provide assurance as to when  if ever  we will achieve profitability 
we expect that our research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and  as a result  we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability 
in thousands as of december cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital for the year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources of liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at december  in accordance with our investment policy  available cash is invested in short term  low risk  investment grade debt instruments 
our cash and short term investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including money market accounts  obligations of us government sponsored entities  high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper 
at december   our holdings of obligations of us government sponsored entities consisted entirely of debt securities issued by the federal home loan bank  the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
historically we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities and cash received in payment for our tests 
in may  we completed a public offering of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
at december   we had approximately million of securities available for issuance under a shelf registration statement 
purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements have been partially financed through capital equipment financing arrangements 
at december  and december   we had notes payable under these equipment financing arrangements of million and million  respectively 
our existing notes payable under these arrangements are scheduled to be fully paid by november cash flows net cash used in operating activities was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities includes net loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
the million decrease in net cash used in operating activities from to was primarily due to a million decrease in net loss excluding depreciation and stock based compensation expense  a million decrease in net cash used related to increases in deferred revenues  a  decrease in net cash used related to accounts payable and a million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by a  million increase in net cash used related to increases in accounts receivable and a million increase in net cash used related to decreases in accrued compensation 
the million decrease in net cash used in operating activities from to was primarily due to a million 
table of contents decrease in net loss excluding depreciation and stock based compensation expense and a  decrease in net cash used related to increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in net cash used related to increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets and a million increase in cash used due to a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  our investing activities have consisted predominately of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures 
the million increase in net cash used in investing activities from to was due to a million increase in net purchases of short term investments as we invested a portion of the cash proceeds from our may public offering of common stock as well as a million increase in capital expenditures for facility expansion and improvements 
the million increase in net cash used in investing activities from to was due to a million increase in net purchases of short term investments as we invested a portion of the cash proceeds from our may public offering of common stock  partially offset by a million decrease in capital expenditures for facility expansion and improvements 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our financing activities include sales of our equity securities and capital equipment financing arrangements 
the million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities from to was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock 
the million increase in net cash provided by financing activities from to included net proceeds of million from our may public offering of common stock  partially offset by a million decrease in cash provided by capital equipment financing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands notes payable obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations total our notes payable obligations are for principal and interest payments on capital equipment financing 
in march  we entered into an arrangement to finance the acquisition of laboratory equipment  computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
in connection with this arrangement  we granted the lender a security interest in the assets purchased with these borrowings 
beginning in april  we could prepay all  but not part  of any amounts owing under the arrangement so long as we also paid a premium on the remaining outstanding principal balance 
this premium was reduced to in april and was further reduced to in april as of december   the outstanding principal balance under this arrangement was million at annual interest rates ranging from to  depending upon the applicable note 
our non cancelable operating lease obligations are for laboratory and office space 
in september  we entered into a non cancelable lease for  square feet of laboratory and office space in redwood city  california 
in january  we entered into a non cancelable lease for an additional  square feet of laboratory and office space in a nearby location 
both leases expire in february we are required to make a series of fixed annual payments under one of our collaboration agreements beginning on the date that we commercially launched oncotype dx 
we made payments of   and  in january  and  respectively 
we are required to make additional payments of  
table of contents in each of through however  because either party may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice  these payments are not included in the table above 
we have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our collaboration agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of specific project milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is generally neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such commitments have not been included in the table above 
off balance sheet activities as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements other than the lease obligations and collaboration payments discussed above 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the next months and to make capital expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and development programs and to scale our commercial operations 
however  we cannot provide assurance as to when  if ever  we will achieve profitability 
we expect to spend approximately million over the next months for planned laboratory equipment and other capital expenditures in order to support the growth of our business 
it may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund working capital and for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  such as licensing technology rights  partnering arrangements for our tests outside the us  establishing direct sales capabilities outside of the us or reduction of debt obligations 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
we have no current plans  agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition or investment  and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to any such transaction 
the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the progress of our product development  regulatory requirements  commercialization efforts  the amount of cash used by operations  progress in reimbursement and the pace of international expansion 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with collections from oncotype dx  will be sufficient to fund our operations and facilities expansion plans for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that our development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these programs through to a successful commercial product 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  the cost of expanding our commercial and laboratory operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of oncotype dx for breast cancer  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with products in the early development and validation phase focused on cancers other than breast cancer  the cost of acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  costs related to international expansion  the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations  and 
table of contents the economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations 
the issuance of equity securities may result in dilution to stockholders  or may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock 
if we raise funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the us federal government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing difficult to obtain 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives 
in addition  we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product or market development programs  which would lower the economic value of those programs to our company 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas  or fsp fsp delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected a partial deferral of sfas under the provisions of fsp we do not expect the application of sfas to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  fasb ratified emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf  which defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in a collaborative arrangement and third parties 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our investment policy provides for investments in short term  low risk  investment grade debt instruments 
our investments in marketable securities  which are comprised primarily of money market funds  obligations of us government agencies and government sponsored entities  high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
due to recent financial and economic conditions  similar investments have experienced losses in value and liquidity constraints which differ from historical patterns 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rate interest rates increase 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  totaling million at december   did not include any auction preferred stock  auction rate securities or mortgage backed investments 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  and we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
to date  we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments 
although we currently expect that our ability to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities will continue  we cannot ensure that this will not change 
we believe that  if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the impact on the fair value of these securities or our cash flows or income would not be material
