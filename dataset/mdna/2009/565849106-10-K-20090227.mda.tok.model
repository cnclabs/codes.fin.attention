prior to our acquisition of western  the first fully integrated expansion of the existing aosp facilities was approved in expansion  which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the jackpine mine  expansion of treatment facilities at the existing muskeg river mine  expansion of the scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure  is anticipated to begin operations in late or when expansion is complete  we will have more than  bpd of net production and upgrading capacity in the canadian oil sands 
the timing and scope of future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review 
during  the alberta government accepted the project s application to have a portion of the expansion capital costs form part of the muskeg river mine s allowable cost recovery pool 
due to commodity price declines in the year  royalties for were one percent of the gross mine revenue 
commencing january   the alberta royalty regime has been amended such that royalty rates will be based on the canadian dollar cad equivalent monthly average west texas intermediate wti price 
royalty rates will rise from a minimum of one percent to a maximum of nine percent under the gross revenue method and from a minimum of percent to a maximum of percent under the net revenue method 
under both methods  the minimum royalty is based on a wti price of cad per barrel and below while the maximum royalty is reached at a wti price of cad per barrel and above  with a linear increase in royalty between the aforementioned prices 
the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of aosp expansion factors which could affect the expansion project include transportation logistics  availability of materials and labor  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects

some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics  availability of materials and labor  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by government or third party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects 
integrated gas our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations 
also included in the financial results of the integrated gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas 
lng operations we hold a percent interest in egholdings  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in may  egholdings completed construction of a million metric tonnes per annum mmtpa lng production facility on bioko island and delivered its first cargo of lng 
lng from the production facility is sold 
table of contents 
index to financial statements under a mmtpa  or mmcfd  sales and purchase agreement with a year term 
the purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the lng on bioko island  with pricing linked principally to the henry hub index  regardless of destination 
this production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the alba field  as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the alba field participants under a long term natural gas supply agreement 
sales of lng from this production facility totaled metric tonnes in in we continued discussions with the government of equatorial guinea and partners regarding a potential second lng production facility on bioko island 
we also own a percent interest in a kenai  alaska  natural gas liquefaction plant  and lease two  cubic meter tankers used to transport lng to customers in japan 
feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the cook inlet 
from the first production in  we have sold our share of the lng plant s production under long term contract with two of japan s largest utility companies  with lng deliveries totaling gross bcf 
in june we  along with our partner  received approval from the doe to extend the export license for this natural gas liquefaction plant through march in april  we began delivering lng cargoes at the elba island  georgia  lng regasification terminal pursuant to an lng sales and purchase agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we have the right to deliver and sell up to bcf of natural gas as lng per year  through march   with a possible extension to november  in september  we signed an agreement under which we will be supplied with bcf of natural gas per year  as lng  for a minimum period of five years 
the agreement allows for delivery of lng at the elba island lng regasification terminal with pricing linked to the henry hub index 
this supply agreement enables us to fully utilize our rights at elba island during the period of this agreement  while affording us the flexibility to commercialize other stranded natural gas resources beyond the term of this contract 
the agreement commenced in methanol operations we own a percent interest in ampco  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
ampco owns a methanol plant located in malabo  equatorial guinea 
feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the alba field 
sales of methanol from the plant totaled  metric tonnes in production from the plant is used to supply customers in europe and the united states 
natural gas technology we are developing a range of natural gas conversion technologies that can connect stranded natural gas to both conventional and transportation fuel markets 
our proprietary gas to fuels gtf process offers the ability to convert natural gas into premium fuels while bypassing conventional intermediate synthetic gasification technology 
the base patent for this technology was awarded in during  we entered into agreements with grt  inc  a delaware corporation  to cooperate on the advancement of gas to fuels related technology 
this transaction provides us with access to additional specialized technical and research personnel and lab facilities  and significantly expanded the portfolio of patents available to us via license and through a cooperative development program 
in addition  we have acquired a percent interest in grt  inc also  during  we completed construction of a facility to demonstrate operation of the fully integrated gtf process at a practical scale 
we are evaluating the commercialization of this technology and have engaged an engineering contractor to provide engineering and design services for using the gtf technology on a commercial scale 
in addition to gtf  we continue to evaluate the application of other natural gas technologies  including lng technology enhancements  gas hydrates and gas to liquids technology 
the above discussion of the integrated gas segment contains forward looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the lng production facility and expectations for a gtf demonstration facility 
factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the lng production facility include partner and government approvals  access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity 
factors that could potentially affect the gtf demonstration facility include construction delays  start up difficulties relating to scale up in the process and unforeseen difficulties in our testing program related to moving from laboratory to practical scale 
the foregoing factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements competition and market conditions strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  in the exploration for and development of new reserves 
we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies  as well as national oil companies  for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties 
we compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end users 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us 
acquiring the more attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front end bonus payments or commitments to work programs 
we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel  including geologists  geophysicists and other specialists 
based upon statistics compiled in the global upstream performance review published by ihs herold inc  we rank ninth among us based petroleum companies on the basis of worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production 
we also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries in north america 
there are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and  if undertaken and completed  these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market 
since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes  there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the aosp at economically viable prices 
we must also compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products 
based upon the the oil gas journal worldwide refinery survey  we rank fifth among us petroleum companies on the basis of us crude oil refining capacity as of december  we compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products wholesale  spot  branded and retail distribution 
we believe we compete with about companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers  including private brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers  about companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market  ten refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded jobbers and dealers  and approximately retailers in the retail sale of refined products 
a jobber is a business who does not carry out refining operations  but who supplies refiner branded products to gasoline stations or convenience stores 
dealers refer to a retail service station or convenience store operator  affiliated with a brand identity 
we compete in the convenience store industry through ssa s retail outlets 
the retail outlets offer consumers gasoline  diesel fuel at selected locations and a broad mix of other merchandise and services 
in recent years  several nontraditional fuel retailers  such as supermarkets  club stores and mass merchants  have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into the retail transportation fuel business 
our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve 
generally  results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases 
price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results 
market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations 
environmental matters the public policy committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues  including environmental matters 
our corporate health  environment and safety organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that are in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs 
we also have a crisis management team  composed primarily of senior management  which oversees the response to any major emergency  environmental or other incident involving us or any of our properties 
legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us 
the kyoto protocol  effective in  has been ratified by countries in which we have or in the future may have operations 
canadian federal and provincial laws  the us energy independence and security act of  the european union requirements and california laws contain provisions related to greenhouse gas emissions 
other climate change legislation and regulations in the united states  canada and abroad are in various stages of development or implementation 
these regulations are further along in development in alberta  canada  and in the european union  where we have significant operations 
our industry and businesses 
table of contents 
index to financial statements throughout the united states are also awaiting the us environmental protection agency s epa actions upon the remand of the us supreme court decision in massachusetts v 
usepa  which could have impacts on a number of air permitting and environmental regulatory programs 
in july  the epa issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anpr to address the supreme court decision and to seek public input on potential actions it may take to regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
action by epa on the anpr is expected in there also is other pending litigation which could affect whether epa regulates greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  a new administration in the us may choose to address greenhouse gas emissions through regulation  permitting or other action in our liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and bitumen production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases 
likewise  emissions arise from our rm t operations  including the refining of crude oil and the transportation of crude oil and refined products 
although there may be adverse financial impact including compliance costs  potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products associated with any legislation  regulation  epa or other action  the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented 
private party litigation has also been brought against emitters of greenhouse gas emissions  but we have not been named in those cases 
as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship  we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations 
we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates 
in addition  we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective 
our businesses are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the oil pollution act of opa with respect to oil pollution and response 
in addition  many states where we operate have their own similar laws dealing with similar matters 
new laws are being enacted  and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more accurately defined 
in some cases  they can impose liability for the entire cost of clean up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not clearly known or determinable because certain implementing regulations for some environmental laws have not yet been finalized or  in some instances  are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the amendments to the caa and its implementing regulations  new water quality requirements and stricter fuel regulations  could result in increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
for a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air  water  solid waste and remediation  see item legal proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of environmental matters  litigation and contingencies 
air of particular significance to our refining operations are epa regulations that require reduced sulfur levels in diesel fuel for off road use 
we have spent approximately million between and  and plan to spend approximately million in on refinery investments to produce ultra low sulfur diesel fuel for off road use  in compliance with epa regulations 
further  we have estimated that we may spend approximately billion over a five year period beginning in to comply with mobile source air toxics ii msat ii regulations relating to benzene content in refined products 
we have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these requirements 
our actual msat ii expenditures have totaled million through december  and we expect to spend million in the cost estimates are forward looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in the epa is in the process of implementing regulations to address current national ambient air quality standards naaqs for fine particulate emissions and ozone 
in connection with these standards  the epa will designate certain areas as nonattainment  meaning that the air quality in such areas does not meet the naaqs 
to address these nonattainment areas  the epa proposed a rule in called the interstate air quality rule iaqr that would require significant emissions reductions in numerous states 
the final rule  promulgated in  was renamed the clean air interstate rule cair 
while the epa expects that states will meet their 
table of contents 
index to financial statements cair obligations by requiring emissions reductions from electric generating units  states were to have the final say on what sources they regulate to meet attainment criteria 
significant uncertainty in the final requirements of this rule resulted from litigation state of north carolina  et al 
v 
epa 
in july  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the cair in its entirety and remanded it to epa to promulgate a rule consistent with the court s opinion 
in december  the court modified its july ruling to leave the cair in effect until epa develops a new rule and control program 
it is expected that the cair will be significantly altered  and it could result in changes in emissions control strategies 
our refinery operations are located in affected states  and some of these states may choose to propose more stringent fuels requirements to meet the cair 
in addition  the epa promulgated a revised ozone standard in march  and the epa has commenced the multi year process to develop the implementing rules required by the clean air act 
we cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the state actions to implement the cair until the epa has issued a revised rule and states have taken further action to implement that rule 
we also cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of the revised ozone standard until the implementing rules are established and judicial challenges over the revised ozone standard are resolved 
water we maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the national pollutant discharge elimination system program of the cwa and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts 
in addition  we are regulated under opa  which amended the cwa 
among other requirements  opa requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances 
also  in case of any such release  opa requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages 
opa also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions 
additionally  opa requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in us waters be double hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double hulled be retrofitted or removed from us service  according to a phase out schedule 
all of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double hulled requirements of opa we operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur 
some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to opa  but with expanded liability provisions  including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility 
we have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by opa  and we have established spill prevention  control and countermeasures spcc plans for facilities subject to cwa spcc requirements 
solid waste we continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations 
the resource conservation and recovery act rcra establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes 
besides affecting waste disposal practices  rcra also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations  the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks usts containing regulated substances 
we have ongoing rcra treatment and disposal operations at one of our rm t facilities and primarily utilize offsite third party treatment and disposal facilities 
in  canada will implement a ban on the land application of certain wastes  and we are developing options to treat or dispose of these wastes consistent with these new restrictions 
ongoing waste handling and disposal related costs  however  are not expected to be material 
remediation we own or operate certain retail outlets where  during the normal course of operations  releases of refined products from usts have occurred 
federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards 
the enforcement of the ust regulations under rcra has been delegated to the states  which administer their own ust programs 
our obligation to remediate such contamination varies  depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate 
a portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state ust reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied 
we also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law

the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its on going reclamation work 
the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan 
the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies 
in february  the alberta energy resources conservation board issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings 
the aosp joint venture parties are reviewing this directive to determine the impact on the oil sands operations and the timeline for the required compliance

we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 
the usx separation on december   pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of july   marathon completed the usx separation  in which its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel llc converted into a delaware corporation named united states steel corporation and became a separate  publicly traded company  and usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation 
as a result of the usx separation  marathon and united states steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership interest in the other 
in connection with the usx separation and pursuant to the plan of reorganization  marathon and united states steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the usx separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the usx separation 
the following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements financial matters agreement under the financial matters agreement  united states steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our principal repayment  interest payment and other obligations under the following  including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations  other than any default caused by us obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former us steel group facilities  with maturities ranging from through  sale leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at united states steel s fairfield works facility  with a lease term to  subject to extensions  obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements  all of which were assumed by united states steel  and certain other guarantees 
the financial matters agreement also provides that  on or before the tenth anniversary of the usx separation  united states steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds 
united states steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or  to the extent not refinanced  paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on  and any premium required to immediately retire  the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds 
under the financial matters agreement  united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us  including all rights related to purchase options  prepayments or the grant or release of security interests 
however  united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases 
the financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations 
the agreement also obligates us to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain letters of credit and other liquidity arrangements required under the assumed obligations 
united states steel s obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to united states steel s accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations 
the financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and united states steel is free to incur additional debt  grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent 
concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties  a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy related industries 
the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review  including the use of master netting agreements  where appropriate 
while no single customer accounts for more than percent of annual revenues  we have significant exposures to united states steel arising from the transaction discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
trademarks  patents and licenses we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications 
although in the aggregate our trademarks  patents and licenses are important to us  we do not regard any single trademark  patent  license or group of related trademarks  patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole

risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business 
the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a substantial or extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices  or in refining and wholesale marketing gross margins  would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets 
prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins fluctuate widely 
our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and the margins we realize on our refined products 
historically  the markets for liquid hydrocarbons  natural gas and refined products have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins are beyond our control 
these factors include worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons  natural gas and refined products  the cost of exploring for  developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  the cost of crude oil to be manufactured into refined products  utilization rates of refineries  natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  changes in weather patterns and climate  natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados  the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and general economic conditions worldwide 
the long term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  as well as on refining and wholesale marketing gross margins  are uncertain 
lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices  may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce  which may reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flows 
significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices or refining and wholesale marketing gross margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets 
estimates of liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and bitumen reserves depend on many factors and assumptions  including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates 
any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and bitumen reserves 
the proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves information included in this report has been derived from engineering estimates 
those estimates were prepared by our in house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and reviewed  on a selected basis  by our corporate reserves group or third party consultants we have retained 
the estimates were calculated using liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices in effect as of december   as well as other conditions in existence as of that date 
any significant future price 
table of contents 
index to financial statements changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves 
future reserve revisions could also result from changes in  among other things  governmental regulation and severance and other production taxes 
proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas that cannot be directly measured 
estimates of economically recoverable liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including location  size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid  rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation  historical production from the area  compared with production from other comparable producing areas  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and repair costs 
as a result  different petroleum engineers  each using industry accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods  may produce different estimates of proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data 
because of the subjective nature of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserve estimates  each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated the amount and timing of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production  the revenues and costs associated with that production  and the amount and timing of future development expenditures 
the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves reflected in this report should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties 
as required by sec rule of regulation s x  the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
in addition  the percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general 
the proved bitumen reserves information included in this report has also been derived from engineering estimates 
reserves related to mining operations are defined as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
proved reserves are measured by various testing and sampling methods 
bitumen reserves as of december  were estimated by third party consultants  using volumetric estimation techniques similar to those used in estimating liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves and are subject to many of the same uncertainties discussed above  except that estimates of bitumen reserves are based on average annual prices consistent with industry practice in canada 
the estimated quantity of net proved bitumen reserves is based on a number of assumptions  including among others commodity prices  volumes in place  presently known physical data  recoverability of bitumen  industry economic conditions  levels of cash flow from operations and other operating considerations 
to the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate  actual recoveries could be different than current estimates 
future proved bitumen reserve revisions could also result from changes in  among other things  governmental regulation and taxation 
if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves  our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline  thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition 
the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  optimize production 
table of contents 
index to financial statements performance  identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced 
accordingly  to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce  our future revenues will decline 
creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors  including obtaining rights to explore for  develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas  drilling success  the ability to complete long lead time  capital intensive projects timely and on budget  the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs  and the ability to fund such activity 
the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce our refining  marketing and transportation profitability and refining and wholesale marketing gross margins 
the profitability of our refining  marketing and transportation operations depends largely on the margin between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks that we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products 
we are a net purchaser of crude oil 
a significant portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies  producing companies and trading companies  including suppliers from the middle east 
these purchases are subject to political  geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in that area of the world 
our overall refining  marketing and transportation profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and rising crude oil and other feedstock prices which we do not recover in the marketplace 
refining and wholesale marketing gross margins historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas  the regulatory climate  logistical capabilities and the available supply of refined products 
we will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with  and changes in environmental health  safety and security laws and regulations  and  as a result  our profitability could be materially reduced 
our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  waste management  pollution prevention measures  greenhouse gas emissions  and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels  as well as laws and regulations relating to public and employee safety and health and facility security 
we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the specific impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of operating facilities  marketing areas and production processes 
we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations  install pollution control equipment  perform site cleanups or curtail operations 
we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new  amended or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us 
we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent  causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue  with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations 
currently  various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of review  discussion or implementation in the united states  canada and european union 
these include proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs  each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
these actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities  install new emission controls at our refineries and other facilities and administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon tax program 
although uncertain  these developments could increase our costs  reduce the demand for the products we sell and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 
our operations and those of our predecessors could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous 
table of contents 
index to financial statements substances 
for example  we have been  and presently are  a defendant in various litigation and other proceedings involving products liability and other claims related to alleged contamination of groundwater with the oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether  or mtbe 
we may become involved in further litigation or other proceedings  or we may be held responsible in existing or future litigation or proceedings  the costs of which could be material 
environmental laws are subject to frequent change and many of them have become more stringent 
in some cases  they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party  without regard to negligence or fault  and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
in  the us congress passed the energy independence and security act eisa  which  among other things  sets a target of miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the united states by model year  and contains a multiple part renewable fuel standard rfs 
the rfs was billion gallons of renewable fuel in  and is billion gallons in  increasing to billion gallons by in the near term  the rfs will be satisfied primarily with fuel ethanol blended into gasoline 
the rfs presents production and logistics challenges for both the fuel ethanol and petroleum refining industries 
the rfs has required  and may in the future continue to require  additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased fuel ethanol use 
the advanced biofuels programs will present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels  including biomass based diesel and cellulosic biofuel  with potentially uncertain supplies of these new fuels 
there will be compliance costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in this law and related regulations 
we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage per gallon or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels 
in addition  tax incentives and other subsidies have made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been which may have reduced and may further reduce refined product margins and refined products ability to compete with renewable fuels 
the recent distress in the financial markets may impact our ability to obtain future financing and could adversely affect entities with which we do business 
in the future we may require financing to grow our business 
financial institutions participate in our revolving credit facility and provide us with business insurance coverage  cash management services  commercial letters of credit and short term investments 
the recent distress affecting the financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go bankrupt has reduced levels of activity in the credit markets 
this could diminish the amount of financing available to companies 
in addition  such turmoil in the financial markets could significantly increase our costs associated with borrowing 
our liquidity and our ability to access the credit or capital markets may also be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
continuing turmoil in the financial markets could make it more difficult for us to access capital  sell assets  refinance our existing indebtedness  enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities 
in addition  there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on us  including insolvency of customers  key suppliers and other counterparties to our commodity and foreign exchange derivative instruments 
worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 
local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us 
a total of percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in was derived from production outside the united states and percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december   were located outside the united states 
all of our bitumen production and proved reserves are located in canada 
in addition  a significant portion of the feedstock requirements for our refineries is satisfied through supplies originating in saudi arabia  kuwait  canada  mexico and various other foreign countries 
we are  therefore  subject to the political  geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located in  and supplies originating from  those areas 
there are many risks associated with operations in international markets  including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas  bitumen or refined product pricing and taxation  other political  economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations 
these risks include political and economic instability  war  acts of terrorism and civil disturbances  the possibility that a foreign government may seize our property with or without compensation  may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens  and fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages and currency controls 

table of contents 
index to financial statements continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other developed countries 
a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 
these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons  natural gas and refined products 
in addition  these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate 
actions of governments through tax and other legislation  executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability  both in the united states and abroad 
the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries 
these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in  or gain access to  opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future 
our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses  and we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities 
our exploration and production operations are subject to unplanned occurrences  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  spills  hurricanes and other adverse weather  labor disputes and accidents 
our oil sands mining operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires  earthquakes  explosions or other interruptions 
in addition  our refining  marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions  fires  pipeline ruptures or other interruptions  crude oil or refined product spills  severe weather and labor disputes 
our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks  as well as hazards of marine operations  such as capsizing  collision  acts of piracy and damage or loss from severe weather conditions 
these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life  significant damage to property and equipment  environmental pollution  impairment of operations and substantial losses to us 
certain hazards have adversely affected us in the past  and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent 
uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital  exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
historically  we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities  with significant self insured retentions 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further 
in some instances  certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  due to hurricane activity in recent years  the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or  in many instances  it is prohibitively expensive 
as a result  our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased 
litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance 
we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future 
the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities  products liability  consumer credit or privacy laws  product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations 
while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us  in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants  and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances 
if we are not able to successfully defend such claims  they may result in substantial liability 
we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities 
there has been a trend in recent years of litigation by attorneys general and other government officials seeking to recover civil damages from companies 
we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future 
in addition to substantial liability  litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations

index to financial statements if ashland fails to pay its taxes  we could be responsible for satisfying various tax obligations of ashland 
as a result of the transactions in which we acquired the minority interest in mpc from ashland in  marathon is severally liable for federal income taxes and in some cases for certain state taxes of ashland for tax years still open as of the date we completed the transactions 
we have entered into a tax matters agreement with ashland  which provides that we will be responsible for the tax liabilities of the marathon group of companies  including the tax liabilities of mpc and the other companies and businesses we acquired in the transactions for periods after the completion of the transactions  and ashland will generally be responsible for the tax liabilities of the ashland group of companies before the completion of the transactions  and the income taxes attributable to ashland s interest in mpc before the completion of the transactions 
however  under certain circumstances we will have several liability for those tax liabilities owed by ashland to various taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service 
if ashland fails to pay any tax obligation for which we are severally liable  we may be required to satisfy this tax obligation 
that would leave us in the position of having to seek indemnification from ashland 
in that event  our indemnification claims against ashland would constitute general unsecured claims  which would be effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of ashland  and we would be subject to collection risk associated with collecting unsecured debt from ashland 
we are required to pay ashland for deductions relating to various contingent liabilities of ashland  which could be material 
we are required to claim tax deductions for certain contingent liabilities that will be paid by ashland after completion of the transactions 
under the tax matters agreement  we are required to pay the benefit of those deductions to ashland  with the computation and payment terms for such tax benefit payments divided into two baskets  as described below basket one this applies to the first million of contingent liability deductions increased by inflation each year up to a maximum of million that we may claim in each year for the first years following the acquisition 
the benefit of basket one deductions is determined by multiplying the amount of the deduction by percent or  if different  by a percentage equal to three percentage points less than the highest federal income tax rate during the applicable tax year 
we are obligated to pay this amount to ashland 
the computation and payment of basket one amounts does not depend on our ability to generate actual tax savings from the use of the contingent liability deductions in basket one 
upon specified events related to ashland or after years  the contingent liability deductions that would otherwise have been compensated under basket one will be taken into account in basket two 
in addition  basket one applies only for federal income tax purposes  state  local or foreign tax benefits attributable to specified liability deductions will be compensated only under basket two 
because we are required to make payments to ashland whether or not we generate any actual tax savings from the basket one contingent liability deductions  the amount of our tax benefit payments to ashland with respect to basket one contingent liability deductions may exceed the aggregate tax benefits that we derive from these deductions 
we are obligated to make these payments to ashland even if we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any benefit for the deductions 
basket two all contingent liability deductions relating to ashland s pre transactions operations that are not subject to basket one are considered and compensated under basket two 
the benefit of basket two deductions is determined on a with and without basis  that is  the contingent liability deductions are treated as the last deductions used by the marathon group 
thus  if the marathon group has deductions  tax credits or other tax benefits of its own  it will be deemed to use them to the maximum extent possible before it will be deemed to use the contingent liability deductions 
to the extent that we have the capacity to use the contingent liability deductions based on this methodology  the actual amount of tax saved by the marathon group through the use of the contingent liability deductions will be calculated and paid to ashland 
because basket two amounts are calculated based on the actual tax saved by the marathon group from the use of basket two deductions  those amounts are subject to recalculation in the event there is a change in the marathon group s tax liability for a particular year 
this could occur because of audit adjustments or carrybacks of losses or credits from other years  for example 
to the extent that such a recalculation results in a smaller basket two benefit with respect to a contingent liability deduction for which ashland has already received compensation  ashland is required to repay 
table of contents 
index to financial statements such compensation to marathon 
in the event we become entitled to any repayment  we would be subject to collection risks associated with collecting an unsecured claim from ashland 
if the transactions resulting in our acquisition of the minority interest in mpc that was previously owned by ashland were found to constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance  we could be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return a portion of interest in mpc  and either of those results could have a material adverse effect on us 
in a bankruptcy case or lawsuit initiated by one or more creditors or a representative of creditors of ashland  a court may review our transactions with ashland under state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws 
under those laws  the transactions would be deemed fraudulent if the court determined that the transactions were undertaken for the purpose of hindering  delaying or defrauding creditors or that the transactions were constructively fraudulent 
if the transactions were found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance  we might be required to provide additional consideration to ashland or to return all or a portion of the interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired from ashland 
under the laws of most states  a transaction could be held to be constructively fraudulent if a court determined that the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value or  in some jurisdictions  less than fair consideration or valuable consideration  and the transferor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by the transfer  was engaged  or was about to engage  in a business or transaction for which its remaining property constituted unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur  or believed it would incur  debts beyond its ability to pay as those debts matured 
in connection with our transactions with ashland completed in  we delivered part of the overall consideration specifically  shares of marathon common stock having a value of million to ashland s shareholders 
in order to help establish that ashland received reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration from us in the transactions  we obtained a written opinion from a nationally recognized appraisal firm to the effect that ashland received amounts that were reasonably equivalent to the combined value of ashland s interest in mpc and the other assets we acquired 
we also obtained a favorable opinion from that appraisal firm relating to various financial tests that supported our conclusion and ashland s representation to us that ashland was not insolvent either before or after giving effect to the closing of the transactions 
those opinions were based on specific information provided to the appraisal firm and were subject to various assumptions  including assumptions relating to ashland s existing and contingent liabilities and insurance coverage 
although we are confident in our conclusions regarding ashland s receipt of reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and ashland s solvency  it should be noted that the valuation of any business and a determination of the solvency of any entity involve numerous assumptions and uncertainties  and it is possible that a court could disagree with our conclusions 
if united states steel fails to perform any of its material obligations to which we have financial exposure  we could be required to pay those obligations  and any such payment could materially reduce our cash flows and profitability and impair our financial condition 
in connection with the separation of united states steel from marathon  united states steel agreed to hold marathon harmless from and against various liabilities 
while we cannot estimate some of these liabilities  the portion of these liabilities that we can estimate amounts to million as of december   including accrued interest of million 
if united states steel fails to satisfy any of those obligations  we would be required to satisfy them and seek indemnification from united states steel 
in that event  our indemnification claims against united states steel would constitute general unsecured claims  effectively subordinate to the claims of secured creditors of united states steel 
the steel business is highly competitive and a large number of industry participants have sought protection under bankruptcy laws in the past 
the enforceability of our claims against united states steel could become subject to the effect of any bankruptcy  fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other law affecting creditors rights generally  or of general principles of equity  which might become applicable to those claims or other claims arising from the facts and circumstances in which the separation was effected

index to financial statements many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners  which may decrease our ability to manage risk 
we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations  such oil and gas exploration and production or pipeline transportation  with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations 
however  these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs  particularly those where we are not the operator 
we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations 
this could affect our operational performance  financial position and reputation 
we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue  without the approval of our stockholders  one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional and other rights  including preferences over marathon common stock respecting dividends and distributions  as our board of directors generally may determine 
the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon common stock 
for example  we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions 
similarly  the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock
