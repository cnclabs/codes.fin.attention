item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition recent trends and outlook 

table of contents as the costs and prices of our products correspondingly rise  certain of those products  particularly those directed at end use markets such as the detergent and oral care markets where their portion of the end product cost is often larger  face an increasing threat of substitution from cost factors alone 
under circumstances where the costs of known and acceptable substitute non phosphate chemistries become economically viable for a significant portion of our end use markets  our customers may decide to utilize the substitute chemistries to control their costs 
if higher costs and prices result in such substitutions for major products and markets and we are not able to shift our manufacturing capabilities to alternate products we can sell profitably  we could face a loss of volumes  revenues and or profits from this kind of cost driven substitution 
although we cannot estimate the pricing levels at which cost substitution will affect us since it depends on variables such as the duration of price escalations  the availability and costs of our products relative to the substitutes  and future marketing and pricing decisions made by our customers  we believe  based on our understanding of where substitutions become feasible  at least of our current end use markets could be exposed to some level of potential cost substitution 
we cannot be sure that actions we take to reduce the effects of cost driven substitution will be effective  nor that those effects ultimately will not be material to our results of operations or financial position 
competitive factors we face significant competition in each of our markets 
in the specialty chemicals industry  competition is based upon a number of considerations  including product differentiation and innovation  product quality  technical service  and supply reliability 
in addition  in some markets  our products are subject to price competition due to factors such as competition from low cost producers  import competition  excess industry capacity and consolidation among our customers and competitors 
new products or technologies developed by competitors may also have an adverse impact on our competitive position 
future expansions could have a negative impact on our competitive position 
innophos mexican production is sold across latin america where  from time to time  it faces strong competition from chinese materials produced by the thermal method  a process more heavily dependent on energy which may be cost advantaged during periods of low energy costs 
the current collapse in energy prices  when combined with depressed domestic markets and relaxed export controls in china  has resulted in a shift in chinese specialty phosphate products into american markets  and has put heavy pressure on our mexican operations 
in the event that prices for chinese products remain low for an extended time and we do not succeed in our arbitration with ocp concerning or future prices for phosphate rock  it is possible that our mexican operations could be unable to compete effectively with chinese phosphate products and thus become uneconomic 
from time to time  we have experienced pricing pressure  particularly from significant customers and often coincident with periods of overcapacity in the markets in which we compete 
the pricing environment for  in line with worldwide economic slowdown  substitutions and increased import presence  appears to be taking on that character 
in the past  we have taken steps to reduce costs and resist possible price reductions by structuring our contracts and developing strong value oriented non price related customer service relationships 
however  price reductions in the past have adversely affected our sales and margins  and if we are not able to offset price pressure when it arises through improved operating efficiencies  reduced expenditures and other means  we may be subject to those same effects in the future 
supplier contract concentration our business activities depend on long term or renewable contracts to supply materials or products 
in particular  we rely to a significant degree on single source supply contracts and some of these contractual relationships may be with a relatively limited number of suppliers 
although most of our supplier relationships are typically the result of multiple contractual arrangements of varying terms  in any given year  one or more of these contracts may come up for renewal 
in addition  from time to time  we enter into toll manufacturing agreements or other arrangements to produce minimum quantities of product for a certain duration 
if we experience delays in delivering contracted production  we may be subject to contractual liabilities to the buyers to whom we have promised the products 
changing technologies our future results will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new products and applications that offer distinct value for our customers 
many of our products could be affected by technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
for example technical grade stpp used as a builder in automatic dishwasher detergents may be substituted by a new builder  specialty acids products  such as polyphosphoric acid used in asphalt modification applications  may be substituted by polymers  or specialty salts products  such as calcium phosphates used in calcium fortification  may be substituted by other sources of calcium such as calcium carbonate 
we expect to continue to enhance our existing products  to identify  develop  and manufacture new products with improved capabilities  and to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position 
we also intend to devote resources to the development of new technologically advanced products and systems and to continue to devote a substantial amount of expenditures to the research and development functions of our business 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving our goals in those regards 

table of contents reliance on rhodia we depend on rhodia s ability to perform its obligations under our acquisition agreements  primarily to indemnify us or provide security against potential liabilities whether asserted or yet to be asserted 
however  rhodia has experienced financial difficulties in recent years  and recently stated it was under significant margin pressure due to the global recession 
there is no assurance that rhodia will be able to fund its obligations to us when  as and if required 
in february  new york state s highest court affirmed a declaratory judgment we won in the lower courts holding rhodia liable for taxes asserted by the mexican national waters commission  or cna  for fresh water extraction  or fresh water claims  at our coatzacoalcos  mexico facility dating back to the period the fresh water claims amount to approximately million inclusive of interest  inflation and penalties  at current exchange rates and are currently being contested in mexican court proceedings 
we cannot be sure that  if proceedings are decided in favor of the cna  the fresh water claims or other claims we have made or will make against rhodia can be satisfied by it  or recovered through actions to attach rhodia s assets in the us or elsewhere 
as a result  we may have to pay cna taxes from our own resources 
we also depend on rhodia s ability to fulfill its responsibilities under certain operating arrangements  including the sulfuric acid supply agreement providing feedstock to the interconnected pcs facility supplying mga at our geismar  la plant 
adverse financial developments affecting rhodia s continued performance under its supply agreement with innophos could require us to provide replacement sulfuric acid  if available  at significantly higher market prices than provided in the contract with rhodia 
international operations we have significant production operations in mexico and canada and believe that revenue from sales outside the us will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
there are inherent risks in international operations  including currency fluctuations and devaluations  economic and business conditions that differ from us cycles  unsettled political conditions and communication and translation errors due to language barriers 
among those additional risks potentially affecting our mexican operations are changes in local economic conditions  currency devaluations  disruption from political unrest and difficulty in enforcing agreements due to differences in the mexican legal and regulatory regimes compared to those of the us risks that our canadian operations may be subject to include changes in laws or regulations differing from trends in the us and currency fluctuations and devaluations 
our overall success as a multinational business depends  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing economic  social and political conditions 
among other things  we are faced with potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  and we have to design local solutions to manage credit risks posed by local customers and distributors 
we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business 
these risks are not limited to just those countries in which we operate facilities 
for example  our mexican operations and the supply of phosphate rock from morocco  including territories under disputed moroccan sovereignty claims  are both subject to the risk of adverse affects from local political unrest 
as a us corporation  we are subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  which generally prohibit us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business 
we sell many of our products in developing countries through sales agents and distributors that are not subject to our disciplinary procedures 
while we and our subsidiaries are committed to conducting business in a legal and ethical manner and we communicate our policies to all who do business with us  we cannot be sure that all our third party distributors or agents remain in full compliance with the fcpa at all times 
product liability exposure many of our products are additives used in the food and beverage  consumer product  nutritional supplement and pharmaceutical industries 
the sale of these additives and our customers products that include them involve the risk of product liability and personal injury claims  which may be brought by our customers or end users of products 
while we adhere to stringent quality standards  in the course of their production  storage and transportation  our products could be subject to adverse effects from foreign matter such as moisture  dust  odors  insects  mold  or other substances organic or inorganic  or from excessive temperature 
historically  we have not been subject to material product liability claims  and none are currently outstanding 
however  because our products are used in manufacturing a wide variety of our customers products  including those ingested by people  we cannot be sure we will not be subject to material product liability or recall claims in the future 
production facility operating hazards our production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including failure of pipeline integrity  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  
table of contents terrorist attacks  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remedial complications  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances  storage tank leaks and other environmental risks 
we have implemented and installed various management systems and engineering controls and procedures at all our production facilities to minimize these risks 
we also insure our facilities to protect against a range of risks 
however  these potential hazards do exist and could cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment  and environmental and natural resource damage  and may result in a suspension of operations or extended shutdowns and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  whose nature  timing  severity and non insured exposures are unknown 
intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures and agreements  and patent  trademark  copyright  unfair competition  trade secrecy  and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
nonetheless  we cannot be sure that any pending patent application or trademark application will result in an issued patent or registered trademark  or that any issued or registered patents or trademarks will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
the use of our intellectual property by others could reduce any competitive advantage we have developed or otherwise harm our business 
moreover  we cannot be sure that our property rights can be asserted in all cases or that we can defend ourselves successfully or cost effectively against the assertion of rights by others 
contingency planning we operate a number of manufacturing facilities in the us  canada and mexico  and we coordinate company activities  including our sales  customer service  information technology systems and administrative services and the like  through headquarters operations in those countries 
our sites and those of others who provide services to them are subject to varying risks of disaster and follow on consequences  both manmade and natural  that could degrade or render inoperable one or more of our facilities for an extended period of time 
such disaster related risks and effects are not predictable with certainty and  although they can be mitigated  they cannot be avoided 
we seek to mitigate our exposures to physical disaster events in a number of ways 
for example  where feasible  we design and engineer the configuration of our plants to reduce the consequences of disasters 
we also maintain insurance for our facilities against casualties  including extended business interruption  and we continually evaluate our risks and develop contingency plans for dealing with them 
although we have reviewed and analyzed a broad range of risks applicable to our business  the ones that actually affect us may not be those we have concluded most likely to occur 
furthermore  although our reviews have led to more systematic contingency planning  our plans are in varying stages of development and execution  such that they may not be adequate at the time of occurrence for the magnitude of any particular disaster event that befalls us 
risks relating to our indebtedness leverage issues our assets were acquired in in a transaction with a high proportion of debt 
after our initial public offering of equity in  we remained what could be characterized as a highly leveraged company through however  by december   our total indebtedness had been reduced to million and our stockholders equity had grown to million  respectively  reflecting a significant de leveraging in accordance with our business policy 
nevertheless  to the extent we are not prohibited by our debt instruments in effect from time to time from incurring additional debt or obligations that do not constitute indebtedness  doing so could intensify the risks to our financial condition resulting from a renewed condition of high leverage 
those risks may include  for example  difficulty satisfying our obligations directly related to our debt including complying with restrictive financial covenants  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt  and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds  refinance existing debt or make discretionary use of funds such as the payment of dividends on our stock 
as noted in the section entitled liquidity in item of this form k  the revolving credit line under our senior bank credit facility expires on august   and we have installment payments of million of term loans under that facility that must be repaid from march to august  the general economic recessionary climate may render us unable to find replacement sources of external working capital facilities in adequate amounts or in a timely manner to make up for the current facility or  if we do find them  they may not be at rates or other terms as favorable to innophos as the expiring facility 
exposure to interest rate volatility as of december   approximately of our total indebtedness bore interest at variable rates 
because these rates change with prevailing interest rates  higher prevailing rates will increase the amount of interest we have to pay on our debt 
although 
table of contents the recent trend has been a reduction in interest rates  rates could increase over the next several years 
we estimate based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december  that our annual debt service obligations could increase by million per year for each increase in the average interest rate we pay 
risks related to our equity ownership structure overhang of salable or issuable stock relative to float the trading market for our common stock was first established in november the float in that market now consists of slightly less than million shares out of a total of million shares issued and outstanding as of february  and an additional million shares subject to issuance covered by exercisable options estimated at february  
under a registration rights agreement  our largest stockholders  affiliated partnerships of bain capital  may require us to register for sale publicly at times largely of their choosing substantially all the outstanding shares of common stock not now in the float 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or the perception that significant sales could occur particularly if the sales are concentrated in time or amount  may depress the trading price of our common stock 
stock sales in the market by persons other than the company could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through our sale of equity securities 
our certificate of incorporation provides for a total authorized capital consisting of up to million shares of common stock and up to million shares of preferred stock in serial designation  of which million shares of common stock had been issued or reserved for issuance and million shares remained authorized but unreserved and unissued all as of february  
we may continue to issue our stock and  subject to any restrictions in our debt instruments  we may issue the stock of our subsidiaries to raise capital 
issuances of our stock or the stock of a subsidiary could dilute the interest of our existing stockholders and may reduce the trading price of our common stock 
contingencies affecting dividends following our public offering  our board of directors initiated a policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock  subject to the availability of funds  legal and contractual restrictions and prudent needs of our business 
however  we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own 
as a result  we are normally dependent upon cash dividends  distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries  most directly innophos  inc  our primary operating subsidiary  and innophos investments holdings  inc  its parent  to make dividend payments on our common stock 
the amounts available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted by covenants in debt agreements governing us and our subsidiaries and by provisions of delaware law 
as allowed by existing debt instruments  we may incur additional indebtedness that may restrict to an even greater degree  or prohibit  the payment of dividends on stock 
we cannot be sure that agreements governing our current or future indebtedness will permit us to adhere to our current dividend policy  or pay any dividends at all  or that continued payment of dividends will remain prudent for our business in the future judgment of our board of directors

table of contents dividends consistent with the determination of our board of directors made in december  we continued to declare and pay quarterly dividends of per share of common stock in subject to action by the board of directors on a quarterly basis  management s present policy is to recommend such dividends be continued  reflecting its judgment at the present time that stockholders are better served if we distribute to them  as quarterly dividends payable at the discretion of the board  a portion of the cash generated by our business in excess of our expected cash needs rather than retaining or using the cash for other purposes 
our expected cash needs include operating expenses and working capital requirements  interest and principal payments on our indebtedness  capital expenditures  incremental costs associated with being a public company  taxes and other costs 
if our financial needs change  management s recommendations concerning dividends may also change 
we are not required to pay dividends  and our stockholders will not be guaranteed  or have contractual or other rights  to receive dividends

background innophos is a leading north american producer of specialty phosphates 
most specialty phosphates are highly customized  application specific compounds that are engineered to meet customer performance requirements 
specialty phosphates are often critical to the taste  texture and performance of foods  beverages  pharmaceuticals  oral care products and other applications 
for example  specialty phosphates act as flavor enhancers in beverages  electrolytes in sports drinks  texture additives in cheeses  leavening agents in baked goods  calcium and phosphorus sources for nutritional supplements  pharmaceutical excipients and cleaning agents in toothpaste 
below is a summary chart of the corporate structure of our subsidiaries 
logo in november we completed an initial public offering of our common stock  or ipo  selling a total of  shares together with  shares sold by selling stockholders at per share for total net proceeds to innophos of million after underwriters discounts  commissions and expenses 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders 
we used the net offering proceeds to pay down approximately million in principal of floating rate senior notes due of a subsidiary  or the floating rate senior notes  in december  paying a call premium and accrued interest of approximately million and resulting in an approximate million charge to earnings for the acceleration of deferred financing charges 

table of contents overview our financial performance in was highlighted by sales of million including selling price increases of million which outpaced increases in raw material costs and other manufacturing expenses in all segments offset by negative volume and mix impacts on revenue of or million that occurred mostly in stpp other products  interest expense improvement of million as a result of the debt restructuring and principal payments  benefit of million from the reversal of the valuation allowance against the united states net deferred tax assets mainly as the result of the usage of our net operating loss carryforwards  net income improvement of million which was mainly driven by selling price improvements  earnings per share improvement of on a diluted basis to versus a loss per share of for  dividends of

recent trends and outlook raw material costs market prices of phosphate rock  sulfur and sulfuric acid  the primary raw materials used in the production of specialty phosphates  increased substantially during the first three quarters of due to high phosphate fertilizer demand 
during the fourth quarter of  as demand for phosphate fertilizers collapsed  the market price of sulfur decreased rapidly  and recently the market price of phosphate rock has also begun to decrease 
innophos purchases phosphate rock  sulfur and sulfuric acid for mexico and has raw material supply contracts in the united states whose pricing is determined in part by phosphate rock and sulfur market prices 
based on current and market price levels for phosphate rock and sulfur  innophos overall us cost structure is expected to remain substantially unchanged from fourth quarter levels 
in december  innophos initiated binding arbitration with ocp  sa  its sole supplier of phosphate rock for mexico  concerning pricing terms for and under the company s agreement with that supplier 
a panel of three arbitrators has now been selected to hear the case  interpret the pricing provisions of the contract  and derive the phosphate rock price for both years 
absent agreement on an expedited process  which the company is seeking  innophos has been advised that a final decision could take up to a year 
last year  the parties reached agreement on interim prices  which the company paid for shipments during management has determined that the contingent liability of having to pay more than the amounts paid for as interim prices is not material 
most recently  the parties reached agreement on interim prices for  which the company will be paying for this year s shipments 
management has determined that the contingent liability of having to pay more than such interim prices is neither remote nor probable  and is reasonably possible 
due to phosphate rock pricing uncertainty for mexico  weakness in the markets served by those operations  and some loss of traditional business  innophos anticipates operating its coatzacoalcos plant at substantially reduced levels during in addition  innophos also built considerable raw material inventory at the end of as a result of these factors  increases in phosphate rock cost will not begin to affect financial performance adversely until after the first quarter of at the earliest 
assuming sulfur market prices in mexico remain at current levels and phosphate rock prices reflect the upper range management has determined to be reasonably possible outcomes of the rock arbitration proceedings discussed in the risk factors section of this report  innophos raw material costs for mexico could then increase by approximately million per quarter at approximately of capacity operations 
overall  therefore  innophos expects its first quarter cost structure  in the united states  mexico  and canada to be substantially similar to the fourth quarter of 
table of contents selling prices historically  innophos has successfully recovered raw material  energy and other cost increases through price increases 
fourth quarter represented a increase compared to fourth quarter  after a series of price increases that were implemented throughout however  current softening demand due to the global recession and increased competition primarily from chinese and european firms are causing downward pressure on selling prices 
management anticipates therefore that selling prices will trend downward throughout management will focus on maintaining market position against increased pressures in all segments by maintaining a competitive offering through continued focus on selling price  enhanced service  innophos proprietary technology  and the overall value the company provides to its customers 
volumes volumes in the us were lower in the fourth quarter of due to overall economic slowness  particularly in accounts exposed to agricultural and industrial markets 
in addition  competitive pressure from european and chinese producers increased as they sought to gain access to the us market as their home market demand slowed 
finally  innophos has seen a modest amount of reformulation that is  changes in customer product composition due to record prices 
the company expects these pressures to continue in volumes in mexico for are expected to be affected more severely by the lack of demand in the fertilizer market  greater import competition  especially for export business  reformulation and recession 
innophos largest mexican customer  for which innophos historically supplied purified phosphoric acid  recently lost significant stpp business due to a combination of reformulation and lost share 
in january  the customer closed one of its three plants estimated at more than half its stpp capacity and is expected to greatly reduce its phosphoric acid purchases 
based on current circumstances  management estimates this could translate into a revenue loss of approximately to of historical total company sales and an annual consolidated operating income reduction of approximately million based on pre historical profitability 
innophos anticipates supplying approximately of this customer s historical quarterly volumes in the first half of and is working with this customer to support its reduced operations by focusing on increasing innophos overall share with this account  including marketing other products to the customer 
management is reducing manufacturing costs across the whole site and is considering several options for the longer term  including seeking new customers for innophos mexican purified phosphoric acid capacity to increase the company s diversification of end markets and customers  or with reasonable investment levels  using the capacity to supply the us operations 
to support these efforts  innophos is investing to upgrade the majority of its technical grade purified acid capacity to food grade capability 
management anticipates this investment will be completed by the end of however  it may take several years to build a customer base for this capacity 
innophos purified phosphoric acid supply chain includes production at its coatzacoalcos  mexico and geismar  la complexes along with purchases from a third party at aurora  nc 
innophos supply of purified phosphoric acid from aurora  nc is being partially disrupted in the first quarter of due to an announced temporary shutdown in part of that complex from lack of phosphate fertilizer demand 
innophos is responding by operating its geismar  la acid purification complex at full capacity and expects that the company will be able to meet its current operating and supply plans 
finally  due to greatly depressed latin american phosphate fertilizer demand  innophos mexico expects to have minimal sales of granular triple superphosphate gtsp in the first quarter of however  innophos volumes are small relative to the market  and innophos expects the reappearance of south american fertilizer demand in the second quarter operations outlook innophos is currently expecting that its us business will have solid financial performance in the first quarter of while demand has been affected by the recession  geismar supplied purified acid is cost effective in today s marketplace  and product selling prices are now at historically high levels 
during  management expects to continue to respond as needed to the increase in overall market competitiveness in order to maintain innophos market position in this business 
in  management anticipates operating innophos mexican facilities at reduced levels of capacity in response to the combination of factors noted above adversely affecting prices and volumes 
the level of operations will be dictated by innophos ability to develop and sustain profitable business in mexico 
in response to anticipated cost increases in raw materials  the company remains focused on running efficiently and reducing costs  particularly in its manufacturing operations 
innophos is benefiting from declining sulfur  energy and transportation costs  and management expects to continue to operate in a manner that optimizes business performance while mitigating uncertainties  particularly as regards phosphate rock price 
management has scrutinized its planned capital expenditures for and expects to focus capital investments on essential projects that maintain the flexibility and efficiency needed in the current dynamic market environment 
for example  innophos is continuing with the expansion and upgrade of its chicago heights facility  which is critical to the growth of the pharmaceutical and 
table of contents nutraceutical excipient product line 
management now projects company wide capital expenditures to approximate million  in line with historical levels 
this amount includes the investments being made to upgrade the mexican phosphoric acid purification plant

operating expenses increased mainly due to professional fees to support growth and other corporate initiatives such as assessing our it systems  higher short term incentive program accruals  higher non cash share based compensation  and increased commercial efforts  partially offset by expense incurred in in connection with the early cancellation of the company s pharma sales agency arrangement with rhodia  inc the increase in the united states from to was mainly due to decreased unusual costs between the two periods

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth a summary of the company s cash flows for the periods indicated 
dollars in millions year ended december  operating activities investing activities financing activities year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in operating activities cash resulted from a favorable change of million in net income partially offset by unfavorable changes of million in net working capital  million in non cash items affecting net income  and million in non current accounts 
the change in net working capital is a use of cash of million in compared to a use in of million  an increase in the use of cash of million 
the increased use of cash is due to higher selling prices which increased accounts receivable balances  higher quantities and raw material costs increasing inventory values without any compensating increase in accounts payable due primarily to advance payments with raw material suppliers to ensure timely deliveries 
decreased current liabilities and accounts payable  and increased other current assets also added to the increased use of cash in during the fourth quarter of  the company made a significant estimated tax payment in mexico due to the high mexican income for total inventories increased million from december levels as the result of increased raw material costs  higher quantities of raw materials purchased prior to january  price increases and increased on hand gtsp inventory due to reduced fertilizer demand 
days of inventory on hand increased days as a result 
the following chart shows its historical performance inventory days on hand net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  a decrease in the use of cash of million 
this was mainly due to million lower capital spending related to the cogeneration project in coatzacoalcos  mexico  and million lower spending for the purchase in of certain assets from rhodia related to the early cancellation of our ten year pharma sales agency agreement 
this was partially offset by an increase in capital spending of million in all other projects 
net cash used for financing activities for the year ended december   was a use of million  compared to a use of million in  a decrease in the use of cash of million 
this was primarily due to million lower term loan principal payments and million tax benefits from stock option exercises  partially offset by million higher dividend payments  million lower proceeds from stock option exercises  and million less for the bond refinancing done in year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase in operating activities cash resulted from a favorable change of million in net income  partially offset by unfavorable changes of million in non cash items affecting net income  million change in net working capital  and million change in non current accounts 
non cash items affecting net income were unfavorable by million in primarily due to our election to pay cash interest on the floating rate senior notes instead of making interest payments in kind  the april refinancing of those notes to solely cash paying notes  and lower deferred financing expense  partially offset by increased depreciation expense and decreased benefit from deferred taxes 
changes in non current accounts had an unfavorable impact on cash of million 
this was mainly due to increased long term liabilities in which were mostly pension related  partially offset by a favorable movement in other comprehensive income 
the change in net working capital was a use of cash of million in compared to a source in of million  an increase in the use of cash of million 
increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and other current assets exceeded increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities in  leading to the million use of cash 
this is due in part to higher selling prices  increasing accounts receivable balances and high raw material costs increasing both inventory and accounts payable 

table of contents total inventories increased million from december levels as the result of higher raw material costs 
days of inventory on hand increased days as a result 
the following chart shows its historical performance inventory days on hand the company and the union in mexico reached an agreement  which was ratified by the union on march  as a result  the company paid approximately million for the severance and benefits for the elimination of personnel and approximately million for benefit reductions for continuing employees  all in the second quarter of net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase in the use of cash of million 
this was mainly due to increased capital spending related to the cogeneration project in coatzacoalcos  mexico  and the purchase of assets from rhodia related to the early cancellation of the pharma sales agency agreement 
as of december   we expended for the cogeneration project which remained on budget and on schedule 
net cash used for financing activities for the year ended december   was a use of million  compared to a use of million in  a decrease of million 
this was primarily due to million less term loan principal payments made in versus  and million of regular quarterly dividends paid on the common stock during indebtedness total debt was million as of december  short term and long term debt net of cash was million as of december   a decrease of million  or from december  total debt comprised borrowings of million of term loan under our bank senior credit facility  million senior subordinated notes due  and million senior unsecured notes due in addition  as part of our bank senior credit facility  we also have a million revolving credit line  of which up to million may be used for letters of credit 
funds are available for continuous borrowing under our senior credit facility revolving credit line  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including the absence of intervening material adverse effects as defined and the absence of default 
we expect that our primary liquidity requirements will be for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
as of december   million remained available under the revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs  as there were no amounts outstanding except for million issued under our letter of credit sub facility 
the commitments under the revolving credit line will expire on august  and  although we expect to seek a new facility  immediate replacement of the current facility cannot be assured given the state of the current credit market 
while the commitments remain in effect  we are permitted to repay revolving credit loans and reborrow amounts that are repaid up to the amount of the revolving credit commitment then in effect  subject to the debt agreement provisions 
the outstanding amount of the term loan at year end is repayable by its terms in quarterly installments of approximately million through september  and four quarterly installments of approximately million thereafter with final payment due august  the interest rate on the borrowings under the senior credit facility is predicated upon the absence of any events of default under the facility 
as of december   no events of default had occurred under the facility and we believe we were in compliance with our covenants under the facility 
in february  innophos mexicana  one of our subsidiaries  secured a million letter of credit facility for suppliers under contractual arrangements 
as indicated elsewhere  the current recommendation of management and the policy of our board of directors is to pay a quarterly dividend on our common stock at an annual rate of per share 
that policy may change and is subject to numerous conditions and variables 
see the section entitled dividends in item of this form k 
the company is required within five days from the issuance of the annual financial statements to make a prepayment of the term loan in an amount equal to of the excess cash flow as defined in our credit agreement in addition to the quarterly principal payments 
as such  as of december  million is classified as the current portion of long term debt which represents million for the excess cash flow requirement plus the required principal payments 
in addition to the estimated excess cash flow payment described above  the company will have increased working capital needs during the first half of when raw material prices reset 
similar to  the company expects to draw on cash in the first half and build cash in the second half of we believe that on hand cash combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our obligations such as debt service  tax payments  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to fund all these obligations through our existing cash and our future operating cash flows 
our current business plans support these operating needs  including our scheduled repayments of debt in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
however  future operating performance is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and other factors that are uncertain 
if the cash flows and other capital resources available to the company are insufficient to fund our debt and other liquidity needs  the company may have to take alternative actions that differ from the company s current operating plan 
included in these actions would be to replace our existing revolving credit facility which expires august  with a new revolving credit facility 
innophos and its subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time seek to acquire or otherwise retire outstanding debt including publicly issued debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  exchanges or otherwise 
debt repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  company liquidity requirements  restrictive financial covenants and other factors applicable at the time 
the amounts involved may be material 

table of contents capital expenditures we spent million in on projects that were capitalized 
additionally  we spent million in on maintenance projects that were expensed during the year 
of this million  million was related to planned major non annual maintenance expenses 
these amounts compare to million of capitalized projects and million of maintenance projects that were expensed during the year of which million was related to planned major non annual maintenance 
we expect our capital expenditures to continue to run below depreciation levels 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our long term contractual cash obligations as of december  dollars in thousands years ending december  contractual obligations total thereafter senior credit facility senior subordinated notes due future service pension benefits other operating leases senior unsecured notes due total amounts do not include variable rate interest payments  any voluntary principal prepayments  and excess cash flow requirements as defined by the credit agreement

critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for bad debts  the recoverability of long term assets such as goodwill and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization periods  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
claims and legal proceedings the categories of asserted or unasserted claims for which the company has estimated a probable liability and for which amounts are estimable are critical accounting estimates 
please refer to the section entitled commitments and contingencies contained in note of item for additional information about such estimates 

table of contents deferred taxes deferred taxes are accounted for by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are assessed for recoverability and a valuation allowance is considered necessary if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we continue to analyze our current and future profitability and probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets in future periods 
please refer to the section entitled income taxes contained in note for additional information regarding deferred taxes 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets of the businesses acquired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires periodic tests of the impairment of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires a comparison  at least annually  of the net book value of the assets and liabilities associated with a reporting unit  including goodwill  with the fair value of the reporting unit  which corresponds to the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit  in the absence of an active market 
when this comparison indicates that impairment must be recorded  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of these assets 
the annual goodwill impairment review is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year 
fair values for goodwill testing are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
significant estimates in the discounted cash flow approach include the cash flow forecasts for each of our reporting units mexico  us and canada  the discount rate and the terminal value 
the five year cash flow forecasts of the reporting units is based upon managements best estimate at the date of the assessment  which incorporates managements long term view of selling prices and sales volumes for the company s products  market conditions for key raw materials and energy  and our operating cost structure 
the discount rate used by the company is consistent with our industry s weighted average cost of capital 
the aggregated fair value of our reporting units was reconciled to our market capitalization at the date of the assessment plus a suitable control premium 
our market capitalization during fourth quarter of exceeded the book value of our equity 
the terminal value is determined by applying each reporting unit business growth factors  which are in line with longer term historical growth rates  to the latest year for which a forecast exists 
given the current economic environment and uncertainties regarding the impact on the company s business  including but not limited to market conditions impacting our selling prices  sales volumes  and raw material costs  the ultimate resolution of our phosphate rock arbitration  and other factors there can be no assurance that the company s estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
any significant changes in assumptions will impact the goodwill impairment analysis which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
based on those valuations  we determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and no goodwill impairment charge was required during the fourth quarter 
in light of the difficult economic conditions for our mexican operations  which experienced a sudden reduction in volumes partially attributable to expected reduced demand from its largest customer  we reassessed our assumptions for the goodwill impairment analysis for this reporting unit 
we have considered this impact in our assessment of fair value for that reporting unit and based on our current projections we continue to believe the mexican reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value 
however  additional significant declines in volumes  declines in selling prices or increased raw material costs above our current projections may result in goodwill impairment charges for this reporting unit in the future 
long lived assets including property  plant and equipment and amortized intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
when this comparison indicates that impairment must be recorded  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of these assets 
impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the determination whether or not these assets are impaired and the corresponding useful lives of these long lived assets requires significant judgment 
as a result of the expected declines in volumes in our mexican operation as described above  the company completed an impairment analysis for certain of its long lived assets during the fourth quarter of and  based on the undiscounted cash flows  no asset impairment charges were recorded 
the development of undiscounted future cash flow projections require management estimates related to forecasted sales and expected costs trends 
to the extent that changes in the current business conditions occur or other management decisions are made that result in adjusted management projections or alternative use of the assets  impairment losses or accelerated depreciation may occur in future periods 
on february   the company has entered into a letter of intent with quimir  a subsidiary of mexichem  to toll manufacture stpp for innophos to lower our production costs 
if this arrangement is finalized the company may temporarily idle its coatzacoalcos stpp unit and associated assets which have a carrying value of approximately million  and therefore  could trigger an asset impairment charge for those assets in 
table of contents stock based compensation expense our compensation programs can include share based payments 
the primary share based awards and their general terms and conditions are as follows stock options  which entitle the holder to purchase  after the end of a vesting term  a specified number of shares of innophos common stock at an exercise price per share set equal to the market price of innophos common stock on the date of grant 
restricted stock grants  which entitle the holder to receive  at the end of each vesting term  a specified number of shares of innophos common stock  and which also entitle the holder to receive dividends paid on such grants throughout the vesting period 
performance share awards which entitle the holder to receive  at the end of a vesting term  a number of shares of innophos common stock  within a range of shares from zero to a specified maximum  calculated using a three year future average return on invested capital ie the three year period for a award as defined solely by reference to the company s own activities 
dividends will accrue over the vesting period and are paid on performance share awards when fully vested 
annual board of directors stock retainer grants  which entitle external members of the board to receive a number of shares of the company s common stock equal to the annual retainer value 
the fair value of the options granted during and was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model were as follows non qualified stock options year ended december  year ended december  expected volatility dividend yield risk free interest rate expected term years years weighted average grant date fair value of stock options since innophos holdings  inc is a newly public entity and has limited historical data on the price of its publicly traded shares  the expected volatility for the valuation of its stock options and performance shares was based on peer group historical volatility data equaling the expected term 
the expected term for the stock options is based on the simplified method as prescribed by staff accounting bulletin no 
and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab sab since the company has limited data on the exercises of stock options 
these stock options qualify as plain vanilla stock options as outlined in sab sab the dividend yield is the expected annual dividend payments divided by the average stock price up to the date of grant 
the risk free interest rates are derived from the us treasury securities in effect on the date of grant whose maturity period equals the options expected term 
the company applies an expected forfeiture rate to stock based compensation expense 
the estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
as actual forfeitures become known  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
in october  the company s board of directors awarded  shares of restricted common stock with a fair value of million to certain executive officers 
these awards were classified as equity awards  vested over nine quarters in equal installments of per quarter and became fully vested by january  for those executives who remained employed by the company

table of contents in canada  salaried employees are covered by defined contribution plans which provide for company contributions as a percent of pay  employee contributions  and company matching contributions 
union represented hourly employees are covered by a defined benefit plan providing benefits based on a negotiated benefit level and years of service 
our pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate on plan assets 
these assumptions require significant judgment and material changes in our pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  changes in levels of benefits provided  and changes in asset levels 
such assumptions are based on benchmarks obtained from third party sources 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption would increase our net periodic benefit cost for our pension and post retirement plans by approximately a decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets would increase our pension plan expense by recently issued accounting standards new accounting standards effective in are described in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates  as borrowings under our senior credit facility will bear interest at floating rates based on libor or the base rate  in each case plus an applicable borrowing margin 
we manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed rate and floating rate debt to the extent practicable consistent with our credit status 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes do not affect earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally affect our earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   we had million principal amount of fixed rate debt and a maximum of million of available floating rate debt  including million under our revolving credit facility 
the company s revolving credit facility expires on august  and renewal or extension of our revolving credit facility is uncertain given the state of the current credit market 
based on million outstanding borrowings as floating rate debt under our senior credit facility  an immediate increase of one percentage point would cause an increase to cash interest expense of approximately million per year 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and other operating expenses and reducing our funds available for capital investment  operations or other purposes 
in addition  a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to service debt  which may affect our ability to make future acquisitions or capital expenditures 
we may from time to time use interest rate protection agreements to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuation 
regardless of hedges  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge our commodity or currency rate risks 
in april  we entered into an interest rate cap derivative instrument with a notional amount of million with a rate cap of  with a referenced index based on a three month libor expiring in april we believe that our concentration of credit risk related to trade accounts receivable is limited since these receivables are spread among a number of customers and are geographically dispersed 
our largest customer represented of our sales  otherwise no other customer accounted for more than of our sales in the last years 
we have purchased forward natural gas contracts which require us to purchase a portion of our monthly natural gas usage requirements at a fixed price 
these contracts are for periods september through december  and apply to our us  canadian and mexican facilities 
foreign currency exchange rates the us dollar is the functional currency of the canadian and mexican operations 
accordingly  these operations monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates  non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates  and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates and at historical exchange rates for the related revenue and expenses of non monetary assets and liabilities 
all transaction gains and losses are included in net income 

table of contents our principal source of exchange rate exposure in our foreign operations consists of expenses  such as labor expenses  which are denominated in the foreign currency of the country in which we operate 
a decline in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency would generally cause our operational expenses particularly labor costs to increase conversely  a decline in the value of the foreign currency relative to the us dollar would cause these expenses to decrease 
we believe that normal exchange rate fluctuations consistent with recent historical trends would have a modest impact on our expenses  and would not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations 
nearly all of our sales are denominated in us dollars and our exchange rate exposure in terms of sales revenues is minimal 
inflation and changing prices our costs and expenses will be subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
significant price fluctuations in raw materials  freight  and energy costs  if not compensated for by cost savings from production efficiencies or price increases passed on to customers could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
refer to risk factors for further discussions on raw materials availability and pricing 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes
