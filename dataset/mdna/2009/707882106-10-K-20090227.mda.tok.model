item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a more detailed description of our and pvr s debt covenants and borrowing capacities 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that future funding will be available if needed and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  it might adversely affect our development plan as currently anticipated and our ability to complete acquisitions each of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce  our reserves will decline  eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations 
we have historically succeeded in substantially replacing reserves primarily through exploration and development and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions 
we have conducted such activities on our existing oil and gas properties as well as on newly acquired properties 
we may not be able to continue to replace reserves from such activities at acceptable costs 
the currently depressed oil and gas prices may further limit the types of reserves that can be developed at acceptable costs 
lower prices also decrease our cash flows and may cause us to reduce capital expenditures 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
we may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flows from operations are reduced and external sources of capital remain limited or unavailable due to the deterioration of the global economy  including financial and credit markets 
in addition  exploration and development activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes  the failure to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 
we are continually identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities 
however  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us 
depending on the longevity of the deterioration of the market  our ability to make acquisitions may be significantly adversely affected 
in the event we are successful in completing an acquisition  we cannot ensure that such acquisition will consist of properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that such acquisition will be profitably integrated into our operations 
we may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures to find  acquire  develop  exploit and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
in  we anticipate making oil and gas segment capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of up to approximately million 
this is million  or  lower than the million of capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  that our oil and gas segment made in as a result of our decreased anticipated capital expenditures  we project a decrease in the number of wells that will be drilled in 
table of contents if oil and gas prices decrease or we encounter operating difficulties that result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected  we may have to reduce the capital we can spend unless we raise additional funds through debt or equity financing 
the current global economic downturn may adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity in the future at prices which will not be dilutive to our existing shareholders or preclude us from issuing equity at all 
in addition  debt financing may not be available if needed and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
future cash flows and the availability of financing will also be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells  and prices of oil and natural gas 
if our revenues were to decrease due to lower oil and natural gas prices  decreased production or other reasons  and if we could not obtain capital through the revolver  or otherwise  our ability to execute our development plans  replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reserves will be found 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment  shortages in experienced labor  failure to secure necessary regulatory approvals and permits  fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  and adverse weather conditions 
the prevailing prices of oil and gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
the availability of drilling rigs can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand  an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region 
another significant risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state  local and other governmental authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and drilling permits  including delays which jeopardize our ability to realize the potential benefits from leased properties within the applicable lease periods  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on or develop our properties 
the wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that natural gas or oil is present or may be produced economically 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
drilling activities can result in dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling costs 
our future drilling activities may not be successful  nor can we be sure that our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular area will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 
also  we may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify 
although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations  we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from all of them 

table of contents we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers  and nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers would reduce our cash flows 
we are subject to risk from loss resulting from our customers nonperformance or nonpayment 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues from our oil and gas segment 
in  of our oil and gas segment revenues and of our total consolidated revenues resulted from two of our oil and gas customers 
any nonpayment or nonperformance by our oil and gas customers would reduce our cash flows 
our business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate 
our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the exploitation  development and exploration for and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas 
these operating risks include fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering and casing collapses  formations with abnormal pressures  pipeline ruptures or spills  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could result in substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damages  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations 
in addition  under certain circumstances  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own  lease or operate 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities  which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
the occurrence of a significant event  not fully insured or indemnified against  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business depends on transportation facilities owned by others 
we deliver substantially all of our oil and natural gas production through pipelines that we do not own 
the marketability of our production depends upon the availability  proximity and capacity of these pipelines as well as gathering systems and processing facilities 
the unavailability or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
federal  state and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and market our oil and natural gas 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are not precise 
this annual report on form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
these estimates are dependent on many variables and  therefore  changes often occur as these variables evolve and commodity prices fluctuate 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could 
table of contents materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed by us 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped 
estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves is based on volumetric calculations and adjacent reserve performance data 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
production revenues from proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized until some time in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  these estimated costs may not be accurate  development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not occur as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of estimated future net cash flows standardized measure referred to herein is the current fair value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual current and future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
as a result  net present value estimates using actual prices and costs may be significantly less than the sec estimate that is provided herein 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for us 
the oil and gas segment may record impairment losses on its oil and gas properties 
quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence in the period of assessment 
lower oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives on certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields  thus reducing proved property reserve estimates 
if such revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves occur  it will have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  on the affected properties  which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher dd a expense 
the revisions may also be sufficient enough to cause impairment losses on certain properties that would result in a further non cash expense to earnings 
if natural gas  crude oil and ngl prices decline or we drill uneconomic wells  it is reasonably possible we will have a significant impairment 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
in  other companies operated approximately of our net production 
our success in properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs 
certain working interest owners in our properties have the right to control the timing of drilling activities on our properties under certain circumstances 
under certain circumstances  certain of the other working interest owners in our properties have the right to limit the amount of drilling activities that can take place on our properties at any given time 
if these working interest owners chose to exercise this right  we could be required to scale back anticipated drilling activities on the affected properties 
in such an event  production from the affected properties would be deferred  thereby decreasing production from the properties in the short term 
our producing property acquisitions carry significant risks 
acquisition of producing oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production 
competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense 
depending on the longevity of the deterioration of the market  our ability to make acquisitions may be significately adversely affected 
in the event we do complete an acquisition  
table of contents its success will depend on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the purchase price  future oil and gas prices  the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves  future operating and capital costs  results of future exploration  exploitation and development activities on the acquired properties and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
a customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems 
additionally  significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 
to the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties  our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited 
integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks 
these risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees 
any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short term or long term effects on our operating results  and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the sale of our oil and natural gas  we periodically enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of two years or less 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil or natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements 
in trying to maintain an appropriate balance  we may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how oil or natural gas prices fluctuate in the future 
in addition  derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
in addition  derivative instruments involve basis risk 
basis risk in a derivative contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
for example  a nymex index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including complex environmental laws 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or a failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection and taxation 
our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water 
in the event of environmental violations  we may be charged with remedial costs 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may  in some circumstances  result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault 
in addition  pollution and similar environmental risks generally are 
table of contents not fully insurable 
these liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

risks related to our ownership interests in pvg and pvr we are not the only partners of pvg and pvr  and pvg s and pvr s respective partnership agreements require them to distribute all available cash to their respective partners  including public unitholders 
pvg and pvr are publicly traded limited partnerships 
we own pvg gp  llc  the sole general partner of pvg 
as of december   we also owned an approximately limited partner interest in pvg 
as of december   pvg owned an approximately limited partner interest in pvr  as well as of the general partner of pvr  which owns a general partner interest and the idrs 
we directly owned an additional limited partner interest in pvr as of december  the remainder of the outstanding limited partner interests in each of pvg and pvr are owned by public unitholders 
although pvg s and pvr s respective partnership agreements require them to distribute  on a quarterly basis  of their available cash to their respective unitholders of record and their respective general partners  we are not the only limited partners of pvg and pvr and  therefore  we receive only our proportionate share of cash distributions from each of pvg and pvr based on our partner interests in each of them 
the remainder of the quarterly cash distributions is distributed  pro rata  to the public unitholders 
for each of pvg and pvr  available cash is generally all cash on hand at the end of each quarter  after payment of fees and expenses and the establishment of cash reserves by their respective general partners 
pvg s and pvr s general partners determine the amount and timing of cash distributions by pvg and pvr and have broad discretion to establish and make additions to the respective partnership s reserves in amounts the general partner determines to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the proper conduct of partnership business  and in the case of pvr  the businesses of its operating subsidiaries including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs  to provide funds for distributions to the respective unitholders and the respective general partner for any one or more of the next four calendar quarters  or to comply with applicable law or any loan or other agreements 
accordingly  cash distributions we receive on our partner interests in pvg and pvr may be reduced at any time  or we may not receive any cash distributions from pvg or pvr  which would in turn reduce our available cash 
pvg s ability to make distributions to us is entirely dependent upon pvg receiving distributions from pvr  and the amount of cash that pvr will be able to distribute to its unitholders  including pvg  principally depends upon the amount of cash it can generate from its coal and natural resource management and natural gas midstream businesses 
pvg s earnings and cash flow consist exclusively of cash distributions from pvr 
consequently  a significant decline in pvr s earnings or cash distributions would have a negative impact on its distributions to its partners  including us 
the amount of cash that pvr will be able to distribute to its partners  including pvg  each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it can generate from its coal and natural resource management and natural gas midstream businesses 
the amount of cash that pvr will generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the amount of coal its lessees are able to produce  the price at which its lessees are able to sell the coal  its lessees timely receipt of payment from their customers  the amount of natural gas transported in its gathering systems  the amount of throughput in its processing plants  the price of and demand for natural gas  the price of and demand for ngls  the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  the fees it charges and the margins it realizes for its natural gas midstream services  and 
table of contents its hedging activities 
in addition  the actual amount of cash that pvr will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond its control  including the level of capital expenditures it makes  the cost of acquisitions  if any  its debt service requirements  fluctuations in its working capital needs  restrictions on distributions contained in its debt agreements  prevailing economic conditions  and the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion for the proper conduct of its business 
because of these factors  pvr may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to continue paying distributions at their current level or at all 
if pvr reduces its per unit distribution  pvg will have less cash available for distribution to its unitholders  including us  and would probably be required to reduce its per unit distribution to its unitholders  including us 
the amount of cash that pvr has available for distribution depends primarily upon pvr s cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and is not solely a function of profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  pvr may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records profits 
since pvr s inception as a publicly traded partnership  it has grown principally by making acquisitions in both of its business segments and  to a lesser extent  by organic growth on its properties 
readily available access to debt and equity capital and credit availability has been and continue to be critical factors in pvr s ability to grow 
the current deterioration in the global financial markets and the consequential adverse effect on credit availability is adversely impacting pvr s access to new capital and credit availability 
depending on the longevity and ultimate severity of this deterioration  pvr s ability to make acquisitions may be significantly adversely affected  as may pvr s ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders and  in turn  would affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
in addition  the timing and amount  if any  of an increase or decrease in distributions by pvr to its unitholders will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of any changes in distributions made by pvg 
pvg s ability to distribute cash received from pvr to its unitholders  including us  is limited by a number of factors  including pvg s estimated general and administrative expenses as well as other operating expenses  expenses of pvr s general partner and pvr  reserves necessary for pvg to make the necessary capital contributions to maintain its general partner interest in pvr  as required by pvr s partnership agreement upon the issuance of additional limited partner secutities by pvr  reserves pvg s general partner believes prudent for pvg to maintain the proper conduct of its business or to provide for future distributions by pvg  and restrictions on distributions contained in any future debt agreements 
a reduction in pvr s distributions will disproportionately affect the amount of cash distributions to which pvg is currently entitled  and  consequently  will affect the amount of cash distributions pvg is able to make to its unitholders  including us 
pvg s ownership of the idrs in pvr  through pvg s ownership of pvr s general partner  entitles pvg to receive its pro rata share of specified percentages of total cash distributions made by pvr with respect to any particular quarter only in the event that pvr distributes more than per unit for such quarter 
as a result  the holders of pvr s common units have a priority over the holders of pvr s idrs to the extent of cash distributions by pvr up to and including per unit for any quarter 
pvg s idrs entitle it to receive increasing percentages  up to  of incremental cash distributions above per unit distributed by pvr on a quarterly basis 
because pvg is at the maximum target cash distribution level on the idrs  
table of contents future growth in distributions pvg receives from pvr  and in distributions we receive from pvg  will not result from an increase in the target cash distribution level associated with the idrs 
furthermore  a decrease in the amount of distributions by pvr to less than per unit per quarter would reduce pvg s percentage of the incremental cash distributions above per common unit per quarter from to  consequently resulting in less cash available to pvg to distribute to its unitholders  including us 
a decrease in the amount of distributions by pvr and  consequently  pvg may be caused by a variety of circumstances 
pvr may generate less cash available for distributions or determine to create larger reserves in computing cash available for distribution 
even if cash available for distribution remained stable  pvg and pvr may determine to modify the idrs to reduce the percentage of incremental cash distributions such idrs are entitled to receive 
pvr may issue additional limited partner interests or other equity securities  which may increase the risk that pvr will not have sufficient available cash to maintain or increase its cash distribution level  which in turn may reduce the available cash that pvg has to distribute to its unitholders  including us 
pvr has wide latitude to issue additional limited partner interests on the terms and conditions established by its general partner 
pvg receives cash distributions from pvr on the general partner interest  idrs and the limited partner interest that pvg holds 
because a majority of the cash pvg receives from pvr is attributable to pvg s indirect ownership of the idrs  payment of distributions on additional pvr limited partner interests may increase the risk that pvr will be unable to maintain or increase its quarterly cash distribution per unit  which in turn may reduce the amount of incentive distributions pvg receives and the available cash that pvg has to distribute to its unitholders  including us 
conflicts of interest may arise because the board of directors of the respective general partners of pvg and pvr has a fiduciary duty to manage the general partners in a manner that is beneficial to their owners  and at the same time  in a manner that is beneficial to the respective unitholders of pvg and pvr 
we own the sole general partner of pvg and pvg owns the sole general partner of pvr 
pvg and pvr are publicly traded limited partnerships 
each of the board of directors of the general partners owes a fiduciary duty to the respective unitholders of pvg and pvr  and not just to us and pvg as owners of the general partners 
as a result of these conflicts  the board of directors of the general partners of pvg and pvr may favor the interests of the public unitholders of pvg and pvr over the interests of the respective owners of the general partners 
our ability to sell our common units of pvg  and pvg s ability to sell its partner interests in pvr  may be limited by securities law restrictions and liquidity constraints 
as of december   we owned  common units of pvg and pvg owned  common units of pvr  all of which are unregistered and restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act of  or the securities act 
unless we or pvg were to register these units  we or pvg are limited to selling into the market in any three month period an amount of pvg common units or pvr common units that does not exceed the greater of of the total number of common units outstanding or the average weekly reported trading volume of the common units for the four calendar weeks prior to the sale 
in addition  pvg faces contractual limitations on its ability to sell its general partner interest and idrs in pvr and the market for such interests is illiquid 
congress is considering proposed legislation that may  if enacted  negatively impact the value of our limited partner interests in pvg by precluding pvg from qualifying for treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership rules 
in response to recent public offerings of interests in the management operations of private equity funds and hedge funds  members of congress are considering substantive changes to the definition of qualifying income under section d of the internal revenue code and changing the characterization of certain types of income received from partnerships 
in particular  one proposal recharacterizes certain income and gain received with respect to investment service partnership interests as ordinary income for the performance of services  which may not be treated as qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships 
as such proposal is currently interpreted  a significant portion of pvg s interests in pvr may be viewed as an investment service partnership interest 
although we are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation  or any other proposals  will ultimately be enacted  the enactment of any such legislation could negatively impact the value of our limited partner interests in pvg 
risks related to pvr s coal and natural resource management business 
table of contents if pvr s lessees do not manage their operations well or experience financial difficulties  their production volumes and pvr s coal royalties revenues could decrease 
pvr depends on its lessees to effectively manage their operations on its properties 
pvr s lessees make their own business decisions with respect to their operations  including decisions relating to the method of mining  credit review of their customers  marketing of the coal mined  coal transportation arrangements  negotiations with unions  employee hiring and firing  employee wages  benefits and other compensation  permitting  surety bonding  and mine closure and reclamation 
if pvr s lessees do not manage their operations well  or if they experience financial difficulties  their production could be reduced  which would result in lower coal royalties revenues to pvr and could have a material adverse effect on pvr s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the coal mining operations of pvr s lessees are subject to numerous operational risks that could result in lower coal royalties revenues 
pvr s coal royalties revenues are largely dependent on the level of production from its coal reserves achieved by its lessees 
the level of pvr s lessees production is subject to operating conditions or events that may increase pvr s lessees cost of mining and delay or halt production at particular mines for varying lengths of time and that are beyond their or its control  including the inability to acquire necessary permits  changes or variations in geologic conditions  such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock embedded in or overlying the coal deposit  changes in governmental regulation of the coal industry  mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems  adverse claims to title or existing defects of title  interruptions due to power outages  adverse weather and natural disasters  such as heavy rains and flooding  labor related interruptions  employee injuries or fatalities  and fires and explosions 
any interruptions to the production of coal from pvr s reserves could reduce its coal royalties revenues and could have a material adverse effect on pvr s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  pvr s coal royalties revenues are based upon sales of coal by its lessees to their customers 
if pvr s lessees do not receive payments for delivered coal on a timely basis from their customers  their cash flow would be adversely affected  which could cause pvr s cash flow to be adversely affected and could have a material adverse effect on pvr s business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues and the value of pvr s coal reserves 
a substantial or extended decline in coal prices from recent levels could have a material adverse effect on pvr s lessees operations including mine closures and on the quantities of coal that may be economically produced from its properties 
in addition  because a majority of pvr s coal royalties are derived from coal mined on pvr s properties under leases containing royalty rates based on the higher of a fixed base price or a percentage of the gross sales price  pvr s coal royalties revenues could be reduced by such a decline 
such a decline could also reduce pvr s coal services revenues and the value of its coal reserves 
additionally  volatility in coal prices could make it difficult to estimate with precision the value of pvr s coal reserves and any coal reserves that pvr may consider for acquisition 
the future impact of the current deterioration of the global economy  including financial and credit markets on coal production levels and prices is uncertain 
depending on the longevity and ultimate severity of the deterioration  demand for coal may decline  which could adversely effect production and pricing for coal mined by pvr s lessees  and  consequently  adversely effect the royalty income received by pvr 
pvr depends on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of its coal royalties revenues and the loss of or reduction in production from any of pvr s major lessees would reduce its coal royalties revenues 
pvr depends on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of its coal royalties revenues 
in the year ended december   five primary operators  each with multiple leases  accounted for of pvr s coal royalties revenues and of our total consolidated revenues 
if any of these operators enters bankruptcy or decides to cease operations or significantly reduces its production  pvr s coal royalties revenues would be reduced 
a failure on the part of pvr s lessees to make coal royalty payments could give pvr the right to terminate the lease  repossess the property or obtain liquidation damages and or enforce payment obligations under the lease 
if pvr repossessed any of its properties  pvr would seek to find a replacement lessee 
pvr may not be able to find a replacement lessee and  if it finds a replacement lessee  pvr may not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time 
in addition  the outgoing lessee could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings that could further delay the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to another operator 
if pvr enters into a new lease  the replacement operator might not achieve the same levels of production or sell coal at the same price as the lessee it replaced 
in addition  it may be difficult for pvr to secure new or replacement lessees for small or isolated coal reserves  since industry trends toward consolidation favor larger scale  higher technology mining operations to increase productivity rates 
pvr s coal business will be adversely affected if pvr is unable to replace or increase its coal reserves through acquisitions 
because pvr s reserves decline as its lessees mine its coal  pvr s future success and growth depends  in part  upon its ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable 
the current deterioration in the global economy  including financial markets  and the consequential adverse effect on credit availability is adversely impacting pvr s access to new capital and credit availability 
depending on the longevity and ultimate severity of this deterioration  pvr s ability to make acquisitions may be significantly adversely affected 
if pvr is unable to negotiate purchase contracts to replace or increase its coal reserves on acceptable terms  pvr s coal royalties revenues will decline as its coal reserves are depleted and pvr could  therefore  experience a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
if pvr is able to acquire additional coal reserves  there is a possibility that any acquisition could be dilutive to earnings and reduce its ability to make distributions to unitholders  including us  or to pay interest on  or the principal of  its debt obligations 
any debt pvr incurs to finance an acquisition may similarly affect its ability to make distributions to unitholders  including us  or to pay interest on  or the principal of  its debt obligations 
pvr s ability to make acquisitions in the future also could be limited by restrictions under its existing or future debt agreements  competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates 
pvr s lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with coal from properties other than pvr s  depriving pvr of the ability to receive amounts in excess of the minimum coal royalties payments 
pvr does not control its lessees business operations 
pvr s lessees customer supply contracts do not generally require its lessees to satisfy their obligations to their customers with coal mined from pvr s reserves 
several factors may influence a lessee s decision to supply its customers with coal mined from properties pvr does not own or lease  including the royalty rates under the lessee s lease with pvr  mining conditions  transportation costs and availability and customer coal quality specifications 
if a lessee satisfies its obligations to its customers with coal from properties pvr does not own or lease  production under its lease will decrease  and pvr will receive lower coal royalties revenues 

table of contents fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation could reduce the production of coal mined from pvr s properties 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for the customers of pvr s lessees 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make coal produced by some or all of pvr s lessees less competitive than coal produced from other sources 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition for pvr s lessees from coal producers in other parts of the country or increased imports from offshore producers 
pvr s lessees depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to deliver coal to their customers 
disruption of these transportation services due to weather related problems  strikes  lockouts  bottlenecks  mechanical failures and other events could temporarily impair the ability of pvr s lessees to supply coal to their customers 
pvr s lessees transportation providers may face difficulties in the future and impair the ability of its lessees to supply coal to their customers  thereby resulting in decreased coal royalties revenues to pvr 
pvr s lessees workforces could become increasingly unionized in the future  which could adversely affect their productivity and thereby reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues 
one of pvr s lessees has one mine operated by unionized employees 
this mine was pvr s third largest mine on the basis of coal production for the year ended december  all of pvr s lessees could become increasingly unionized in the future 
if some or all of pvr s lessees non unionized operations were to become unionized  it could adversely affect their productivity and increase the risk of work stoppages 
in addition  pvr s lessees operations may be adversely affected by work stoppages at unionized companies  particularly if union workers were to orchestrate boycotts against its lessees operations 
any further unionization of pvr s lessees employees could adversely affect the stability of production from its coal reserves and reduce its coal royalties revenues 
pvr s coal reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate  which could materially adversely affect the quantities and value of pvr s coal reserves 
pvr s estimates of its coal reserves may vary substantially from the actual amounts of coal its lessees may be able to economically recover 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves  including many factors beyond pvr s control 
estimates of coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions  any one of which may  if incorrect  result in an estimate that varies considerably from actual results 
these factors and assumptions relate to geological and mining conditions  which may not be fully identified by available exploration data  the amount of ultimately recoverable coal in the ground  the effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and future coal prices  operating costs  capital expenditures  severance and excise taxes and development and reclamation costs 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to pvr s coal reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variations may be material 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on the coal reserve data provided by pvr 
any change in fuel consumption patterns by electric power generators away from the use of coal could affect the ability of pvr s lessees to sell the coal they produce and thereby reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues 
according to the us department of energy  domestic electric power generation accounted for approximately of domestic coal consumption in the amount of coal consumed for domestic electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity  the price and availability of competing fuels for power plants such as nuclear  natural gas  fuel oil and hydroelectric power and environmental and other governmental regulations 
pvr believes that most new power plants will be built to produce electricity during peak periods of demand 
many of these new power plants will likely be fired by natural gas because of lower construction costs compared to coal fired plants and because natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel 
the increasingly stringent requirements of the caa may result in more electric power generators shifting from coal to natural gas fired power plants 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment air emissions 

table of contents extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generators could have corresponding effects on the ability of pvr s lessees to sell the coal they produce and thereby reduce pvr s coal royalties revenues 
federal  state and local laws and regulations extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides  mercury and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants  which are the ultimate consumers of the coal pvr s lessees produce 
these laws and regulations can require significant emission control expenditures for many coal fired power plants  and various new and proposed laws and regulations may require further emission reductions and associated emission control expenditures 
as a result of these current and proposed laws  regulations and trends  electricity generators may elect to switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions  possibly further reducing demand for the coal that pvr s lessees produce and thereby reducing its coal royalties revenues 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment air emissions 
concerns about the environmental impacts of fossil fuel emissions  including perceived impacts on global climate change  are resulting in increased regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases in many jurisdictions and increased interest in and the likelihood of further regulation  which could significantly affect pvr s coal royalties revenues 
global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention 
several widely publicized scientific reports have engendered widespread concern about the impacts of human activity  especially fossil fuel combustion  on global climate change 
legislative attention in the united states is being paid to global climate change and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  particularly from coal combustion by power plants 
such legislation was introduced in congress in  and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the united states and further proposals or amendments are likely to be offered in the future 
although the united states supreme court s recent decision in massachusetts v 
environmental protection agency related to new motor vehicles  the reasoning of the decision could affect regulation of carbon dioxide emissions under other federal regulatory programs  including those that regulate emissions from coal fired power plants 
several states have also either passed legislation or announced initiatives focused on decreasing or stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels  and many of these measures have focused on emissions from coal fired power plants 
see item  business governmental regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment air emissions 
enactment of laws  passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the united states or some of its states  or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources 
this may adversely affect the use of and demand for fossil fuels  particularly coal 
delays in pvr s lessees obtaining mining permits and approvals  or the inability to obtain required permits and approvals  could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
mine operators  including pvr s lessees  must obtain numerous permits and approvals that impose strict conditions and obligations relating to various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining 
the permitting rules are complex and can change over time 
the public has the right to comment on many permit applications and otherwise participate in the permitting process  including through court intervention 
accordingly  permits required by pvr s lessees to conduct operations may not be issued  maintained or renewed  may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements that restrict pvr s lessees ability to economically conduct their mining operations 
limitations on pvr s lessees ability to conduct their mining operations due to the inability to obtain or renew necessary permits  or due to uncertainty  litigation or delays associated with the eventual issuance of these permits  could have an adverse effect on its coal royalties revenues 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment mining permits and approvals 
uncertainty over the precise parameters of the cwa s regulatory scope and a recent federal district court decision may adversely impact pvr s coal lessees ability to secure the necessary permits for their valley fill surface mining activities 
to dispose of mining overburden generated from surface mining activities  pvr s lessees often need to obtain government approvals  including cwa section permits to construct valley fills and sediment control ponds 
ongoing uncertainty over which waters are subject to the cwa may adversely impact pvr s lessees ability to secure these necessary permits 
in addition  a decision by a us district court in west virginia invalidated a permit issued to one of pvr s lessees for the republic no 
mine and enjoined pvr s lessee  alex energy  inc  from taking any further actions under this permit 
this ruling was appealed and the appellate court reversed and vacated the district court s order 
it is unclear if this ruling will be appealed or if the permits will be challenged on other grounds 
uncertainty over the correct legal standard for issuing section permits may lead to rulings invalidating other permits  additional challenges to various permits and additional delays and costs in applying for and obtaining new permits that could ultimately have an adverse effect on pvr s

see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment clean water act  for more information about the litigation described above pvr s lessees mining operations are subject to extensive and costly laws and regulations  which could increase operating costs and limit its lessees ability to produce coal  which could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
pvr s lessees are subject to numerous and detailed federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting coal mining operations  including laws and regulations pertaining to employee health and safety  permitting and licensing requirements  air quality standards  water pollution  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  the discharge of materials into the environment  surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations 
pvr s lessees are required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment 
the costs  liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be significant and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
the possibility exists that new laws or regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially affect pvr s lessees mining operations  either through direct impacts such as new requirements impacting its lessees existing mining operations  or indirect impacts such as new laws and regulations that discourage or limit coal consumers use of coal 
any of these direct or indirect impacts could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalties revenues 
see item  business government regulation and environmental matters pvr coal and natural resource management segment 
because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry and  notwithstanding compliance efforts  pvr does not believe violations by its lessees can be eliminated completely 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and  to a lesser extent  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 
pvr s lessees may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from their operations 
if pvr s lessees are required to pay these costs and liabilities and if their financial viability is affected by doing so  then their mining operations and  as a result  pvr s coal royalties revenues and its ability to make distributions to us  could be adversely affected 
the pvr coal and natural resource management segment may record impairment losses on its long lived assets 
the pvr coal and natural resource management segment has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years
