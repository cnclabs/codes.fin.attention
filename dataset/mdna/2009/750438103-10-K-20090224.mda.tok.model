sales in our accessory platform includes home entertainment  wireless  music  computer  video game and gps accessories  media storage  power adapters  digital imaging products and headphones increased in this increase was driven by sales of digital to analog television converter boxes 
the sales of the converter boxes are a result of the pending transition of full power television broadcast signals in the united states from broadcasting in analog format to broadcasting only in digital format 
this transition is scheduled to take place in the second quarter of and we expect a decrease in the sales of these units in the second half of the year 
we also experienced sales gains in video game accessories in this increase was partially offset by decreases in wireless  music  and imaging accessories sales

kiosks kiosk sales consist primarily of handset sales  postpaid and prepaid commission revenue and related wireless accessory sales 
kiosk sales decreased or million in this sales decrease was driven primarily by a decline in the number of our sprint nextel branded kiosks  but was partially offset by sales gains at our sam s club kiosks 
our contract to operate sprint nextel kiosks expires in june of we are currently in discussion with sprint nextel to renew this contract  but the ultimate resolution is unknown at this time 
the possible outcomes include renewing the contract under the same terms and conditions  modifying the contract  or ceasing operations 
in february  we signed a contract extension through march   with a transition period ending june   with sam s club to continue operating kiosks in certain sam s club locations 
as part of the terms of the contract extension  we will assign the operation of kiosk locations to sam s club by july upon the execution of this agreement  sam s club had the right to assume the operation of approximately kiosk locations

if we had owned of radioshack de mexico for all of  we would have recognized a total of approximately million in net sales and operating revenues for the year 
sales to independent dealers did not significantly change from gross profit consolidated gross profit and gross margin are as follows year ended december  in millions gross profit gross profit decrease gross margin consolidated gross profit and gross margin for were  million and  respectively  compared with  million and in  resulting in a decrease in gross profit dollars and a basis point decrease in our gross margin 
this decrease was primarily driven by increased sales of lower margin products such as digital to analog television converter boxes  video gaming products and accessories  and laptop computers  as well as a product shift away from higher rate new activations to lower rate existing customer upgrades in our postpaid wireless business 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by lower average selling prices in gps and media storage and by aggressive pricing required in our wireless platform in the first quarter to respond to a more competitive market environment 
additionally  the gross margin was favorably impacted by refunds for federal telecommunications excise taxes we recorded in a portion of these refunds totaling million was recorded as a reduction to cost of products sold  which accounted for a basis point increase in our gross margin 
see note federal excise tax in notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of the federal telecommunications excise tax

the amended and restated lease agreement provides for us to occupy approximately of the corporate headquarters complex for a primary term of three years with no rental payments required during the term 
the agreement also provides for a renewal option on approximately half of this space for an additional two years at market rents 
this agreement resulted in a non cash net charge to other sg a of million for the second quarter of this net amount consisted of a net loss of million related to the assets conveyed to tcc and a million charge to reduce a receivable for economic development incentives associated with the corporate headquarters to its net realizable value

we recorded this amount based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores 
it was determined that the net book value of many of the stores long lived assets was not recoverable 
for the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows  we wrote down the associated long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
net interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for  a decrease of million or 
interest expense decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on our floating rate debt exposure resulting from our interest rate swaps 
due to the implementation of fasb staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  for our convertible notes  we will recognize additional non cash interest expense of million for the year ended december  interest income decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a lower interest rate environment

at december   the fair value of these warrants was zero 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate was impacted by the execution of a closing agreement with respect to a puerto rico income tax issue during the year  which resulted in a credit to income tax expense 
this discrete item lowered the effective tax rate for by basis points 
in addition  the effective tax rate was impacted by the net reversal of approximately million in unrecognized tax benefits  deferred tax assets and accrued interest related to the settlement of various state income tax issues and the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to our taxable year

this million reversal lowered our effective tax rate basis points for the year ended december  acquisition of radioshack de mexico in december  we acquired the remaining interest slightly more than of our mexican joint venture radioshack de mexico  sa de cv with grupo gigante  cv de cv we now own of this subsidiary which consists of radioshack branded stores and dealers throughout mexico 
the purchase price was million which consisted of million in cash paid and transaction costs  net of cash acquired  plus million in assumed debt 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the purchase price allocation resulted in an excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired of million  all of which was attributed to goodwill 
the goodwill will not be subject to amortization for book purposes but rather an annual test for impairment 
the premium we paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired was based on the established business in mexico and our ability to expand our business in mexico and possibly other countries 
the goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes

additionally  we consolidated our distribution centers in the fall of management also reduced our cost structure  including our advertising spend rate and our workforce within our corporate headquarters 
a number of other cost reductions were implemented 
as of december   we considered our restructuring program to be substantially complete 
the restructuring affects comparability in certain areas of this md a discussion and is discussed where necessary 
see financial impact of restructuring program below for a discussion of the financial impact of our restructuring program 
net sales and operating revenues consolidated net sales decreased or million to  million in  from  million in this decrease was primarily due to a comparable store sales decline of in addition to the closure of us radioshack company operated stores during june and july as part of our restructuring 
approximately of the stores were closed in july  with a majority of the remainder closed in the last half of june the decrease in comparable store sales was primarily caused by a decline in our wireless and personal electronics platform sales 
us radioshack company operated stores to assist in comparability  the revenue discussion presented below primarily analyzes results excluding the stores closed in excluding the effects of the store closures  sales in our wireless platform decreased in this decrease was primarily driven by a decline in postpaid wireless sales for our two main wireless carriers 
we believe that these sales declines were the result of increased wireless competition  a challenging wireless industry environment  and a shift to prepaid handsets and corresponding service plans 
this decrease  however  was partially offset by increased sales of gps products  particularly in the fourth quarter of  and prepaid wireless handset sales 
including the effects of the store closures  wireless platform sales decreased

including the effects of the store closures  technical platform sales decreased 
excluding the effects of the store closures  sales in our service platform decreased in prepaid airtime sales increased for the year ended december   however  this gain was more than offset by decreases in bill payment revenue 
including the effects of the store closures  service platform sales decreased 
other revenue decreased million or in due in part to the store closures and to a decline in store repair revenue 
kiosks kiosk sales decreased or million in while this decrease is partially attributable to fewer kiosk locations compared to the prior year  we believe that this sales decline was primarily the result of increased wireless competition  a challenging wireless industry environment  and a customer shift to prepaid handsets which are generally priced lower than postpaid handsets 
other sales other sales in included sales of our now closed canadian company operated stores 
other sales were down million or in this sales decrease was primarily due to the sale or closure of five service centers late in the second quarter of  fewer dealer outlets in  and a decline in product sales to the remaining dealers

depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization for declined million or 
this decrease was primarily due to the closure of stores and acceleration of depreciation as part of our restructuring  as well as a reduction in our capital expenditures during additionally  the decline within the kiosk segment was the result of an impairment recorded during the third quarter of impairment of long lived assets and other charges during  we recorded impairment charges for long lived assets related primarily to our sprint nextel kiosk operations and us radioshack company operated stores of million 
we recorded this amount based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores 
it was determined that the net book value of many of the stores long lived assets was not recoverable 
for the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows  we wrote down the associated long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
in february  as part of our restructuring program  our board of directors approved the closure of to us radioshack company operated stores 
during the first half of  we identified the stores for closure and subsequently performed the impairment test 
based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores  it was determined that the net book value of some of the stores long lived assets to be held for use was not recoverable 
for the stores with insufficient estimated cash flows  we wrote down the associated long lived assets to their estimated fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss related to our us radioshack company operated store segment 
by july   we had closed specific stores under the restructuring program  there were no additional closures under this program for the remainder of the year 
also  we purchased certain assets from wireless retail  inc during the fourth quarter of for million  which resulted in the recognition of million of goodwill and a million intangible asset related to a five year agreement with sam s club to operate wireless kiosks in approximately sam s club locations nationwide 
these assets relate to our kiosk segment 
as a result of continued company and wireless industry growth challenges  together with changes in our senior leadership team during the third quarter of that resulted in a refocus on allocation of capital and resources towards other areas of our business  we determined that our long lived assets  including goodwill associated with our kiosk operations  were impaired 
we performed impairment tests on both the long lived assets associated with our sam s club agreement  including the intangible asset relating to the five year agreement  and the accompanying goodwill 
with respect to the long lived tangible and intangible assets  we compared their carrying values with their estimated fair values using a discounted cash flow model  which reflected our lowered expectations of wireless revenue growth and the ceased expansion of our kiosk business  and determined that the intangible asset relating to the five year agreement was impaired 
this assessment resulted in a million impairment charge to the intangible asset related to our kiosk segment in the remaining intangible balance is being amortized over the remaining life of the sam s club agreement  which was originally scheduled to expire in september with respect to the goodwill of million  we estimated the fair value of the sam s club reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model similar to that used in the long lived asset impairment test 
we compared it with the carrying value of the reporting unit and determined that the goodwill was impaired 
as the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value  we then compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
this resulted in an million impairment of goodwill related to our kiosk segment in additionally  based on historical and expected cash flows for us radioshack company operated stores and kiosks  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to property and equipment and an impairment charge of million related to goodwill 
these impairment charges  aggregating million  were recorded within impairment of long lived assets and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
net interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for  a decrease of million or 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower average outstanding debt  which was partially offset by rising interest rates on our floating rate debt exposure 
interest income increased to million in from million in this increase was due to a higher average investment balance for  as well as higher average investment rates 
additionally  we recorded million of interest income related to federal telecommunications excise tax refunds during see note federal excise tax for a discussion of the impact of the federal telecommunications excise tax 
other income loss in  we recognized a net gain of million relating to our derivative exposure to sirius 
during the third quarter of  we modified the expected date at which we would settle the warrants  resulting in a million unrealized gain  which was offset by mark to market losses of million during the year  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  additionally  in we had a million loss related to an other than temporary impairment of other investments

as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility  nor were any of our facilities utilized during interest charges under our facilities are derived using a base libor rate plus a margin which changes based on our credit ratings 
our bank syndicated credit facility has customary terms and covenants  and we were in compliance with these covenants at december  impact of global credit crisis and economic downturn during the last four months of  a combination of economic factors created an extremely adverse environment for the retail industry 
these factors included volatility in the capital markets  increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments  and limited or no access to those markets for many companies and consumers 
these credit market conditions  the general downturn in the us economy  and consumer sentiment as reflected in record low measurements of the conference board consumer confidence index during the fourth quarter of contributed to a significant reduction in consumer spending during the fourth quarter as compared to and other recent years 
our consolidated net sales decreased or million to  million for the fourth quarter  compared with  million in consolidated gross profit decreased or million to million for the fourth quarter  compared with million in while these declines were significant  we were able to generate million in pre tax income and million of net cash provided by operating activities during the fourth quarter 
if the current economic conditions persist or worsen  it could have an adverse impact on our business and on the financial condition of some of our customers  wireless and other service providers  and merchandise suppliers 
although we have not experienced a material increase in customer bad debts or non performance by suppliers or service providers  current market conditions increase the probability that we could experience losses from customer  supplier  or service provider defaults 
if a scenario as described above occurred  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a further reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
we do not have any debt maturities until and  as discussed above  our liquidity needs are generally met through cash provided by operations and our cash on hand 
if we need additional funds  we can draw on our credit facility expiring in capitalization the following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated 
december  dollars in millions dollars of total capitalization dollars of total capitalization current debt long term debt total debt stockholders equity total capitalization our debt to total capitalization ratio increased in from  due to the issuance of million of convertible notes 
debt ratings below are the agencies ratings by category  as well as their respective current outlook for the ratings  as of february  rating agency rating outlook standard and poor s bb stable moody s ba stable fitch bb negative on august   standard and poor s revised their outlook to stable from negative and affirmed our bb corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings 
the remaining ratings and outlooks are consistent with those reported in our annual report on form k for the calendar year ended december   and were affirmed by moody s and fitch on august   and august   respectively 
factors that could impact our future credit ratings include free cash flow and cash levels  changes in our operating performance  the adoption of a more aggressive financial strategy  the economic environment  conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries  continued sales declines in comparable stores  our financial position and changes in our business strategy 
if further downgrades occur  they will adversely impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs  access to debt capital markets  vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs 
due to improvements in liquidity  we terminated our commercial paper program during the third quarter of dividends we have paid common stock cash dividends for consecutive years 
on november   our board of directors declared an annual dividend of per share 
the dividend was paid on december   to stockholders of record on november  the dividend payment of million was funded from cash on hand 
operating leases we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations and our corporate campus  to lower our capital requirements 
share repurchases in february  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to million of our common stock in open market purchases 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares or million of our common stock under this program 
during  we repurchased million shares or million of our common stock under this program 
as of december   there were no further share repurchases authorized under this program 
in july  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
during the third quarter of  we repurchased million shares or million of our common stock under this plan 
as of december   there was million available for share repurchases under this plan 
seasonal inventory buildup typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory buildup range between million and million 
the funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additionally  borrowings may be utilized to fund the inventory buildup as described in available financing above 
contractual and credit commitments the following tables  as well as the information contained in note indebtedness and borrowing facilities to our notes to consolidated financial statements  provide a summary of our various contractual commitments  debt and interest repayment requirements  and available credit lines 
the table below contains our known contractual commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts committed less than year years years over years long term debt obligations interest obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total purchase obligations include our product commitments  marketing agreements and freight commitments 
includes a million liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
for more information regarding long term debt and lease commitments  refer to note indebtedness and borrowing facilities and note commitments and contingencies  respectively  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below contains our credit commitments from various financial institutions 
in millions commitment expiration per period credit commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments assigned lease obligations we have retail leases for locations that were assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these lease obligations arose from leases assigned to compusa  inc compusa as part of its purchase of our computer city  inc subsidiary in august following an announcement in february of its intentions to close as many as stores and an announcement in december that they had been acquired by gordon brothers group  compusa stores ceased operations in january a portion of the closed stores represents locations where we may be liable for the rent payments on the underlying lease 
to date  we have been named as defendants in a total of eleven lawsuits from lessors seeking payment from us 
based on all available information pertaining to the status of these leases  and after applying the provisions set forth within sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and fin  reasonable estimation of a loss an interpretation of sfas no 
 during the fourth quarter of  we established an accrual of million  recorded in current liabilities 
in the first quarter of  we increased our accrual to million  reflecting our revised estimate based on further developments 
we are continuing to monitor this situation and will update our accrual as more information becomes available 
financial impact of restructuring program as discussed previously  our restructuring program  as originally stated in february  contained four key components update our inventory focus on our top performing us radioshack company operated stores  while closing to us radioshack company operated stores and aggressively relocate other us radioshack company operated stores consolidate our distribution centers reduce our overhead costs store closures as of december   we had closed stores as a result of our restructuring program 
our decision to close these stores was made on a store by store basis  and there was no geographic concentration of closings for these stores 
for these closed stores  we recognized a charge in of million to sg a for future lease obligations and negotiated buy outs with landlords 
a lease obligation reserve was not recognized until a store had been closed or when a buy out agreement had been reached with the landlord 
regarding the stores we closed as a result of the restructuring program during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the long lived assets associated with certain of these stores 
it was determined that the net book value of several of the stores long lived assets was not recoverable based on the remaining estimated future cash flows related to these specific stores 
we also recognized million in accelerated depreciation associated with closed store assets for which the useful lives had been changed due to the store closures 
in connection with these store closures  we identified retail employees whose positions were terminated by december  these employees were paid severance  and some earned retention bonuses if they remained employed until certain agreed upon dates 
the development of a reserve for these costs began on the date that the terms of severance benefits were established and communicated to the employees  and the reserve was recognized over the minimum retention period 
as of december   million had been recognized in sg a as retention and severance benefits for store employees  with million in benefits paid to that date 
additionally  as part of our store closure activities  we incurred and recognized in sg a million in expenses in primarily in connection with fees paid to outside liquidators and for close out promotional activities for the stores 
all stores identified for closure under the restructuring program were closed as of july  additionally  we continue to negotiate buy out agreements with our landlords  however  remaining lease obligations of million still existed at december  there is uncertainty as to when  and at what cost  we will fully settle all remaining lease obligations 
distribution center consolidations we closed a distribution center located in southaven  mississippi  and sold a distribution center in charleston  south carolina  in during the year ended december   we recognized a lease obligation charge in sg a in the amount of million on the lease of the southaven distribution center and a gain of million on the sale of the charleston distribution center 
we also incurred a million charge related to severance for approximately employees 
additionally  there were million in other expenses 
service center operations we closed or sold five service center locations during the year ended december   resulting in the elimination of approximately positions 
we recognized charges to sg a of million and million related to lease obligations and severance  respectively 
this severance obligation was paid as of december  additionally  there were million in other expenses 
overhead cost reductions management conducted a review of our cost structure to identify potential sources of cost reductions 
in connection with this review  we made decisions to lower these costs  including reducing our advertising spend rate in connection with adjustments to our media mix 
during the year ended december   we reduced our workforce by approximately positions  primarily within our corporate headquarters 
we recorded charges to sg a for termination benefits and related costs of million  of which million had been paid as of december  during  severance payments totaling million were paid  leaving an accrued severance balance of million as of december  inventory update we replaced underperforming merchandise with new  faster moving merchandise 
we recorded a pre tax charge to cost of products sold of approximately million during the fourth quarter of  as a result of both our normal inventory review process and the inventory update aspect of our restructuring program 
the following table summarizes the activity related to the restructuring program from february   through december  asset accelerated in millions severance leases impairments depreciation other total total charges for total spending for  net of amounts realized from sale of fixed assets total non cash items accrual at december  total spending for additions for accrual at december  we made cash payments during in the amount of million 
the total remaining accrual at december   was million related to remaining lease obligations 
see the allocation of our restructuring charges within our segments in note segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation with the exception of increased energy costs in and the first half of  inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation under the cost method  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  and stock based compensation 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
in most cases  the third party service provider pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
fee or commission revenue  net of a reserve for estimated service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third party service provider  while the residual revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
estimated product refunds and returns  service plan deactivations  residual revenue and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
if actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million in inventory valuation our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost which approximates fifo or market 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated external and internal freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the point of sale 
typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  technological obsolescence  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value  calculated as the amount we expect to realize  net of estimated selling costs  from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory  is determined to be less than the recorded cost  we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use our history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that may arise above the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million 
as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
additionally  for claims that exceed our deductible amount  we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries  since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
effective january   we began recognizing uncertain income tax positions based on our assessment of whether the tax position was more likely than not to be sustained on audit  as set forth within fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
additionally  we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
a reserve has been established based on our best estimate of the probable losses in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside legal counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as negative cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
the carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
we estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges  which could be material to our results of operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets related to business acquisitions 
the original valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates for future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
we review our goodwill and other intangible asset balances on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill or an intangible asset might exceed their current fair value 
the determination of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow and other comparable market analyses 
these valuation techniques require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
if actual results or performance of certain business units are different from our estimates  we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill or intangible assets 
the total value of our goodwill and intangible assets at december   was million 
stock based compensation we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock and deferred stock units 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock based incentive plans for a more complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
at the date that an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a lattice model with monte carlo simulations 
the black scholes merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use highly subjective assumptions  including expected option life  expected volatility  and expected employee forfeiture rate 
we use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and the employee forfeiture rate  and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
additionally  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense in would have affected our net income by approximately million 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in md a and in other parts of this report include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  intend  potential or similar words 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the only derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks were the interest rate swaps noted in our md a 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment position at december   of million  consisting of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of our interest rate swaps  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in a change in annual net interest expense of million 
this hypothesis assumes no change in the principal or investment balance
