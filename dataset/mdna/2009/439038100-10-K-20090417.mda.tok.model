item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risk factors detailed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business 
we may lose market share due to competition  which would decrease future sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented 
hooker competes with many domestic and foreign manufacturers 
some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised  well recognized  branded products 
competition from foreign producers has increased dramatically in the past few years 
we may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  including increases in supplier and production costs 
also  due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings  we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through styling  finish and other construction techniques from those of our competitors 
in addition  large retail furniture dealers have the ability and could at any time begin to obtain offshore sourcing on their own 
as a result  we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share  which may lower sales and earnings 
an economic downturn could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
home furnishings are generally considered a postponeable purchase by most consumers 
economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings 
these events could also impact retailers  hooker s primary customers  possibly resulting in a decrease in our sales and earnings 
changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  new housing starts  existing home sales  and geopolitical factors are particularly significant economic indicators for our company 
failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business and decrease sales and earnings 
furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes 
if we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices 
this could result in lower sales and earnings 
a loss of several large customers through business consolidations  failures or other reasons could result in a decrease in future sales and earnings 
the loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations  failures or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our sales and earnings 
lost sales may be difficult to replace 
amounts owed to hooker by a customer whose business fails may become uncollectible 
our ability to grow sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of our business strategies 
since  we have transitioned from manufacturing most of our products to sourcing most of them from offshore suppliers 
as a result  we are now primarily a design  sourcing  marketing and logistics company with domestic upholstery manufacturing capabilities 
our ability to maintain and grow sales and earnings depends on the continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of our overall business strategies and business systems for designing  marketing  sourcing  distributing and servicing our products 
we must also make good decisions about product mix and inventory availability targets 
since we have exited domestic manufacturing of wood furniture and are now completely dependent on offshore suppliers for wood and metal furniture products  we must continue to enhance relationships and business systems that allow us to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with our global sourcing suppliers 
hooker also must continue to evaluate the appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products 
all of these factors affect our ability to grow sales and earnings 
we depend on suppliers in china for a very high proportion of our imported furniture products  and a disruption in supply from china or from our most significant chinese supplier could undermine our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and our sourcing costs 
in fiscal  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of our import purchases and the factory in china from which we directly source the largest portion of our import products accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported products 
a sudden disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory to adequately meet demand for approximately four months 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months before remedial measures could be implemented 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products could adversely affect net sales and profit margins 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in us dollars for periods typically of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
these price changes could adversely impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods 
our dependence on offshore suppliers could  over time  adversely affect our ability to service customers  which could lower future sales and earnings 
in march  we exited domestic wood furniture manufacturing 
we now rely exclusively on offshore suppliers for our wood and metal furniture products 
our offshore suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality  design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price 
if our suppliers do not meet our specifications  we may need to find alternative vendors  potentially at a higher cost  or may be forced to discontinue products 
also  delivery of goods from offshore vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured wood and metal furniture  such as shipment delays caused by customs or labor issues 
our failure to fill customer orders during an extended business interruption by a major offshore supplier could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in decreased sales and earnings 
we rely on offshore sourcing for all of our wood and metal products  and for some of our upholstered products 
we are subject to changes in local government regulations  which could result in a decrease in earnings 
changes in political  economic  and social conditions  as well as laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we source our products could have an adverse impact on our performance 
these changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to customers 
international trade policies of the united states and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us 
imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports  taxes  import duties and other charges on imports could increase our costs and decrease our earnings 
for example in  the us department of commerce imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the united states from china 
in this case  none of the rates imposed were of sufficient magnitude to alter our import strategy in any meaningful way  however  these tariffs are subject to review and could be increased in the future 
we may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies  which could disrupt our business  dilute our earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock 
we may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages 
however  we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth 
we may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations 
acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business 
we may pay for future acquisitions using cash  stock  the assumption of debt  or a combination of these 
future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share 
if demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines and we respond by realigning manufacturing  our near term earnings could decrease 
since march  our domestic manufacturing operations consist solely of upholstered furniture 
a decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost savings programs 
these programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
we may decide to source certain products from offshore suppliers  instead of continuing to manufacture them domestically 
these realignments and cost savings programs typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near term earnings before the expected cost reductions from realignment are realized 
we may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays  adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers and increase costs  any of which could decrease our sales and earnings 
we use various types of wood  leather  fabric  foam and other filling material  high carbon spring steel  bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
we do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
unfavorable fluctuations in the price  quality and availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers 
the inability to meet customers demands could result in the loss of future sales 
we may not always be able to pass along price increases in raw materials to our customers due to competition and market pressures 
we may experience impairment of our long lived assets  which would decrease earnings and net worth 
accounting rules require that long lived assets be tested for impairment at least annually 
we have substantial long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  trademarks and trade names  which based upon the outcome of the annual test  could result in the write down of all or a portion of these assets 
a write down of our assets would  in turn  reduce our earnings and net worth

on august   hooker approved a change in our fiscal year 
after the fiscal year that ended november   our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to january in addition  starting with the fiscal year that began january   we adopted quarterly periods based on thirteen week reporting periods which will end on a sunday rather than quarterly periods consisting of three calendar months 
as a result  each quarterly period generally will be thirteen weeks  or days  long 
however  since our fiscal year will end on the sunday closest to january  in some years generally once every seven years the fourth quarter will be fourteen weeks long and the fiscal year will consist of weeks eg  the fiscal year that ended february  was weeks 
for more information about the changes in our fiscal year and quarterly periods  please refer to our form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on september  in connection with the change in our fiscal year  we completed a two month transition period that began december  and ended january  and filed a transition report on form q for that period on march  the financial statements filed as part of this annual report on form k include the fifty two week period that began february  and ended on february fifty three week period that began january  and ended on february   two month transition period that began december  and ended january   and twelve month period that ended november  we did not recast the financial statements for the twelve month period ended november   principally because the financial reporting processes in place for that period included certain procedures that were completed only on a quarterly basis 
consequently  to recast that period would have been impractical and would not have been cost justified 
for fiscal year we reclassified warehousing and distribution and operations management expenses from selling and administrative expenses to cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
accordingly  these costs have also been reclassified for prior periods to conform to the current year s method of presentation 
we reclassified million for fiscal and million for fiscal overview we have seen a growing consumer preference for lower priced  high quality imported furniture products since led by the change in consumer demand  from to we systematically increased our reliance on high quality imported home furnishings with a coordinated exit from domestic wood furniture manufacturing 
we closed our last domestic wood manufacturing plant during the first quarter 
following the sale of all manufacturing assets no longer needed in the business and the reduction in the workforce of approximately  wood manufacturing employees  we have replaced a domestic operating model for wood furniture  which had high overhead and high fixed costs  with a low overhead  variable cost import model 
since  our business has been impacted by low levels of consumer confidence and a weak housing market 
by late  the economic malaise  exacerbated by weak credit markets  had spread to the broader us economy 
as a result  the residential home furnishings industry has seen an unprecedented decline in demand for its products 
results of operations for the weeks ended february  and the fifty three weeks ended february  reflect our transformation into a home furnishings design  marketing and logistics company with world wide sourcing capabilities 
we are now focused on imported wood and metal furniture  as well as both domestically produced and imported upholstered home furnishings 
in early  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of sam moore furniture industries  inc  a bedford  virginia manufacturer of upscale occasional chairs with an emphasis on fabric to frame customization in the upper medium to high end price niches 
we began operating the business as sam moore furniture llc during the fiscal second quarter 
on december   we completed our acquisition of certain assets of opus designs furniture  llc  a specialist in moderately priced imported youth furniture 
we have integrated this business with our existing imported wood and metal furniture business and now offer this brand to customers as opus designs by hooker 
because fiscal included four fewer shipping days than fiscal  management s discussion of results of operations includes information regarding profitability performance as a percentage of net sales and daily average sales rates 
following are the principal factors that impacted our results of operations during the week period ended february  based on operating days in each period and excluding discontinued  domestically produced wood furniture  average daily net sales declined during the day fiscal year compared to the day fiscal year 
the decline in average daily net sales mirrors the year over year decline in incoming order rates we have experienced since the fiscal third quarter resulting from an industry wide slow down in business at retail 
operating margin during the fiscal year compared with the fiscal year was negatively impacted by a decrease in gross profit margin  an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  and impairment charges incurred in fiscal we experienced an erosion of gross profit margin to of net sales compared with in the prior fiscal year  largely due to an increase in direct costs as a percentage of net sales  resulting from higher prices from virtually all suppliers of imported products  higher ocean freight costs  including fuel surcharges  higher upholstery material costs  and increased warehousing expense from the addition of two facilities in asia  and the west coast service center in california 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales  due to lower net sales 
however  these expenses actually declined by million  or  driven primarily by lower selling and compensation expenses  and lower professional fees and lower contributions expense  due to the donation of the high point showrooms in fiscal these cost reductions were partially offset by higher allowance for bad debts and costs incurred to introduce the opus designs by hooker product line to our customer base 
finally  we recorded million in asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter  including the elimination of all goodwill related to bradington young and opus designs by hooker youth furniture lines and a partial write down the carrying value of the bradington young trade name 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items for the annual periods included in the consolidated statements of income fifty two fifty three twelve weeks ended weeks ended months ended february  february  november  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses restructuring credits charges goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  hooker furniture reported net sales of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal net sales of our wood and metal furniture decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in fiscal  principally due to lower unit volume 
the decline in wood and metal furniture unit volume was attributed to a sharp decline in sales as a result of the industry wide slow down in business at retail and lower shipments of discontinued domestically produced wood furniture 
based on operating days in each period  and excluding the impact of discontinued  domestically produced wood furniture  average daily net sales declined to million per day during the day fiscal year  compared to million per day during the day fiscal year 
we experienced lower average daily unit volume shipments overall and in every product category  except youth bedroom and upholstered seating  which increased due to the acquisition of opus designs in december and the inclusion of a full year of sales for sam moore  which was acquired in april overall  average selling prices declined significantly 
the primary contributors to the overall decline were  the sharp drop in the average selling price of upholstered furniture 
this drop was due to the increased proportion of upholstery sales of less expensive  predominantly fabric covered products manufactured by sam moore  which was in its first full year as a hooker subsidiary  and the impact of our exit from the domestic wood and metal furniture business 
the unit volume of higher priced domestically produced wood products was partially replaced by lower priced imports 
the remaining domestic wood products were heavily discounted during fiscal the average selling price for imported wood and metal furniture decreased due to heavier discounting in a challenging market and the mix of products shipped 
bradington young s imported and domestically produced leather upholstered furniture showed higher average selling prices while sam moore s average prices declined in both categories 
gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales compared to in fiscal  primarily due to increased product and shipping and warehousing costs  lower fixed cost absorption due to lower sales of domestically produced upholstered furniture  and higher warehousing and distribution expenses due to the addition of two facilities in china and one in california 
these costs were partially offset by lower salary and benefit expenses resulting from staff reductions at our bradington young and domestic wood and metal furniture operations 
for fiscal  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million  compared with million in  due to last year s donation of two former bradington young s showrooms to a local university  and lower selling expenses  professional fees and administrative payroll costs 
these costs were partially offset by higher bad debt expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to lower net sales in the current year 
during fiscal  we recorded million million after tax  or per share in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  principally related to a write off of million in goodwill resulting from the acquisition of opus designs a write off of million in goodwill remaining from the company s purchase of bradington young in  an impairment charge of million in the value of the bradington young trade name 
we also recorded restructuring credits of   after tax or per share in fiscal for previously accrued employee benefits and environmental costs not expected to be paid 
during fiscal  we recorded   after tax  or per share in restructuring and asset impairment charges net of restructuring credits 
our operating income margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales  compared to operating income margin of of net sales for fiscal  principally due to the million increase in restructuring and goodwill and intangible asset impairment costs  the decrease in gross profit margin to from  and the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in fiscal  due to the decline in sales although these costs decreased million or excluding the effect of restructuring and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  operating profitability in fiscal still declined year over year compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of lower gross profit margins on our imported wood and metal furniture and domestic and imported upholstered furniture 
the following table reconciles operating income as a percentage of net sales operating margin to operating margin excluding these charges restructuring and special charges as a percentage of net sales for each period fifty two fifty three weeks ended weeks ended february  february  operating margin  including restructuring and special charges goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges donation of two showrooms restructuring credits charges operating margin  excluding restructuring and special charges the operating margin excluding the impact of restructuring charges and special charges is a non gaap financial measure

other income  net was  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared to other income  net of million for fiscal  primarily the consequence of a decrease in interest income from lower interest rates and lower cash balances 
our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease was principally a result of an increase in non cash charitable contributions of finished furniture as a percentage of pretax income and lower net cost related to our captive insurance program 
net income for fiscal declined by  or million  to million  or per share  from million  or per share  for fiscal as a percent of net sales  net income decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  we reported net sales of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal net sales of our wood and metal furniture decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in fiscal  principally due to lower unit volume 
the decline in wood and metal furniture unit volume was attributed to a sharp decline in discontinued domestically produced wood furniture sales and an industry wide slow down in business at retail 
we experienced lower average daily unit volume on shipments overall and in every product category except bradington young imported leather upholstery  which experienced a slight increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal sam moore fabric upholstery sales amounted to million for the three quarters since it was acquired at the beginning of the fiscal second quarter 
based on actual shipping days in each period  average daily net sales declined to million per day during the day fiscal year compared to million per day during the day fiscal year 
overall  average selling prices declined slightly 
the primary contributor to the overall decline was the sharp decline in domestically produced wood furniture average selling prices  principally due to sharp discounting offered on these discontinued products 
we experienced slight increases in average selling prices for imported wood and metal and bradington young imported and domestically produced leather upholstered furniture 
average selling prices for imported wood and metal furniture during fiscal year increased in part due to the mix of products shipped and lower discounting  compared to fiscal year while average selling prices per unit for both bradington young domestically produced and imported leather upholstered furniture increased  bradington young s overall per unit average selling price declined slightly  due to the higher proportion of imported products shipped 
gross profit margin for fiscal increased to of net sales compared to in fiscal  principally due to the larger proportion of sales of higher margin imported products and the lower delivered cost of those products as a percentage of net sales  as well as to reductions in temporary warehousing and storage costs for imported wood furniture products 
for fiscal  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million compared with million in the increase is principally due to the selling and administrative expenses incurred by sam moore and a million charitable contribution for the donation of two former bradington young showrooms to a local university 
these cost increases were offset by lower early retirement and non cash esop costs  lower selling expenses and a gain on the settlement of a corporate owned life insurance policy in connection with the death of a former hooker executive 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to lower net sales in the current year 
during fiscal  we recorded   after tax  or per share in restructuring and asset impairment charges net of restructuring credits  including  for additional asset impairment  disassembly and exit costs associated with the closing of the martinsville  va

during fiscal  we recorded million million after tax  or per share in restructuring and asset impairment charges net of restructuring credits 
our operating income margin for fiscal increased to of net sales  compared to operating income margin of of net sales for fiscal  principally due to the million  or  decrease in restructuring and asset impairment costs  the increase in gross profit margin to from  partially offset by the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in fiscal  due to the decline in sales  but also to the addition of sam moore and the large donation of property to a local university 
excluding the effect of restructuring and asset impairment charges and the december donation of the two former bradington young showrooms  operating profitability in fiscal improved year over year compared to fiscal  principally as a result of higher gross profit margins on our imported wood and metal furniture

these measures are not intended to reflect our overall financial results other income  net was million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to other expense  net of  for fiscal this improvement was the result of an increase in interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances and a decrease in interest expense on lower debt levels 
our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the effective rate declined in fiscal principally due to the tax effect of the esop 
in fiscal  we reversed previously recorded income tax expense related to our esop in connection with the settlement of an irs audit 
in addition  we recorded no esop compensation cost during the current year period after the termination of that plan in january the effective rate also declined during the current year period due to the non taxable gain recorded on the settlement of a corporate owned life insurance policy discussed previously  and lower assessments under our captive insurance arrangement compared to fiscal these declines were partially offset by an increase in our effective state income tax rate  principally attributed to california state income taxes incurred as a result of opening the new west coast distribution center 
net income for fiscal rose by  or million  to million  or per share  from million  or per share  for fiscal as a percent of net sales  net income increased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal two month transition period compared to fiscal first quarter the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the consolidated statements of operations

based on actual shipping days in each period  average daily net sales declined to  per day during the day fiscal transition period compared to  per day during the day operating period from december  through january  and from  per day during the day fiscal first quarter 
average daily net sales increased for imported wood  metal and upholstered furniture for the transition period compared to the fiscal first quarter  principally due to slightly higher unit volume 
this increase was offset by a continued decline in average daily net sales rates for domestically manufactured wood furniture and a moderate decline in average daily net sales rates for domestically produced upholstered furniture 
overall average selling prices decreased slightly for wood  metal and upholstered furniture during the two month transition period compared with the fiscal first quarter  principally due to higher sales discounting offered on overstocked and discontinued domestically produced wood furniture products  as well as a small decline in domestic upholstered furniture selling prices  partially offset by increases in imported wood and upholstered furniture average selling prices 
average number of units sold per day declined during the two month transition period compared to the fiscal first quarter 
average per day unit sales for imported wood and metal and upholstered furniture increased slightly  while average daily per unit sales for domestic upholstered furniture declined moderately and domestic wood and metal furniture average per day unit sales declined sharply 
gross profit margin increased to of net sales in the two month transition period compared to in the fiscal first quarter 
this improvement was the result of an increase in the gross profit margin for wood and metal furniture  partially offset by a decline in the gross profit margin for upholstered furniture 
the increase in gross profit margin on wood and metal furniture was principally due to an increased proportion of sales of imported wood  metal and upholstered furniture and was partially offset by a significantly lower gross profit margin on domestically produced wood furniture 
gross profit margin on domestically produced wood furniture declined as production costs as a percentage of net sales increased in the two month transition period compared  to the fiscal first quarter  principally due to lower production levels 
bradington young s gross profit margin decline for the two month transition period versus the fiscal first quarter was principally due to lower production levels 
selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in the two month transition period and the fiscal first quarter 
on january   we announced that we had terminated our esop  effective january  the termination resulted in an million  non cash  non tax deductible charge to earnings in january with an offsetting increase in shareholders equity 
as a result of the esop termination  approximately million shares of previously unallocated shares of company common stock held by the esop were allocated to eligible employees  resulting in the million charge to operating income 
to effect the termination of the esop  we redeemed and retired approximately million of the shares of company common stock held by the esop  with proceeds to the esop of million or per share 
the esop used the proceeds to repay the outstanding balance on the esop loan 
through november   we recorded non cash esop cost for the number of shares that we committed to release to eligible employees at the average closing market price of our common stock during the period 
during the two month transition period  except for the effect of the esop termination discussed above  no shares were committed to be released 
as a result  no non cash esop cost was recorded during the two month transition period 
we recorded  in non cash esop cost during the first quarter 
the cost of the plan was allocated to cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses based on employee compensation 
during the two month transition period  we recorded aggregate restructuring and asset impairment charges of million million after tax  or per share  principally for severance and related benefits for approximately hourly and salaried employees that were terminated million and additional asset impairment charges for the expected costs to sell the real and personal property of the martinsville  va 
manufacturing facility 
in the first quarter  we recorded restructuring charges of   after tax  or per share to prepare the pleasant garden  nc manufacturing facility for sale and for additional asset impairment related to the closing of this facility 
principally due to the esop termination and restructuring and asset impairment charges  we incurred an operating loss for the two month transition period of million  or of net sales  compared to operating income of million  or of net sales in the first quarter

these measures are not intended to reflect our overall financial results other income  net increased to  in the two month transition period from  in the first quarter 
this improvement was the result of an increase in interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances and a decrease in interest expense  due to one less month of interest expense in the two month transition period compared  to the three month first quarter 
we recorded income tax expense of million for the two month transition period and million for the first quarter 
despite the net loss for the transition period  we incurred income tax expense in the transition period because the million non cash esop termination charge was not tax deductible 
in connection with the esop termination  we wrote off the related deferred tax asset in the amount of  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share  for the two month transition period and net income of million  or per share  in the first quarter

current liabilities decreased to million at february   from million at february  as a result of lower accounts payable  accrued salaries and accrued taxes 
our long term debt  including current maturities  decreased million to million on february   compared to million on february  as a result of scheduled debt payments

despite lower inventory purchases in fiscal  inventories increased by million in fiscal due to the natural lag between the decline in customer order rates and our reduction of orders with our suppliers 
we continue to modify our inventory plan in reaction to the steepening decline in demand  and expect to bring inventory levels down over the next two to three months 
in fiscal year  cash generated from operations of million increased million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a million decline in payments to suppliers and employees principally due to a decline in the purchase of imported products and a million decrease in interest paid  net due to an increase interest income and a decline in interest expense

swap agreements we are party to an interest rate swap agreement that in effect provides for a fixed interest rate of through on our term loan 
in  we terminated a similar swap agreement  which in effect provided a fixed interest rate of approximately on that term loan 
our million payment to terminate the former swap agreement is being amortized over the remaining payment period of the loan  resulting in an effective fixed interest rate of approximately on the term loan 
we are accounting for the interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge 
the aggregate fair market value of our swap agreement decreases when interest rates decline and increases when interest rates rise 
overall  interest rates have declined since the inception of our swap agreement 
the aggregate decrease in the fair market value of the effective portion of the agreement of   pretax as of february     pretax as of february  and   pretax as of january  is reflected under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note other comprehensive income loss to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
substantially all of the aggregate pre tax decrease in fair market value of the agreement is expected to be reclassified into interest expense during the next twelve months 
debt covenant compliance the credit agreement for our revolving credit facility and outstanding term loan contains  among other things  financial covenants as to minimum tangible net worth  debt service coverage  the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash charges and maximum capital expenditures 
on february   we amended our credit facility with bank of america  na the amendment  effective as of january  modified the definition of cash flow to exclude all non cash charges  including intangible asset impairment from the calculation of cash flow for purposes of the company s debt service coverage ratio under the credit agreement  and increased the commitment fee and the fee for libor loans and letters of credit under the credit agreement 
all other terms were unchanged 
we are in compliance with these covenants as of february  liquidity  financial resources and capital expenditures as of february   we had an aggregate million available under our revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs 
standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of february  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line on february  any principal outstanding under the credit line is due march  we believe that we have the financial resources including available cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations  and lines of credit needed to meet business requirements for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  working capital  dividends on our common stock  repurchases of common stock and repayments of outstanding debt 
cash flow from operations is highly dependent on incoming order rates and our operating performance 
we expect to spend to million in capital expenditures during fiscal year to maintain and enhance our operating systems and facilities 
supplier commitments during fiscal we made advance payments to one of our finished goods suppliers against our purchase orders placed with that supplier 
the purpose of the advances was to facilitate the supplier s purchase of raw materials in order to ensure timely delivery of furniture shipments to us 
the current balance of the advances is approximately  we also assisted the supplier in obtaining additional bank financing by issuing a standby letter of credit in the amount of  which expires in july  as security for that financing 
in conjunction with the issuance of the letter of credit  we entered into a security agreement with the supplier  which provides us with a security interest in certain assets of the supplier and its shareholders 
our maximum exposure under the advances and the standby letter of credit as of february  was approximately  which we believe to be adequately secured under this arrangement 
common stock and dividends since february   our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of million of our common stock in a series of repurchase authorizations  subject to the limitations of a trading plan under rule b of the securities exchange act of and certain board imposed guidelines 
we completed these share repurchases in august on january   awards totaling  shares of restricted common stock were granted to the five non employee members of the board of directors 
each award is subject to vesting requirements and other limitations in accordance with the hooker furniture stock incentive plan 
on april   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on may   to shareholders of record may  commitments and contractual obligations as of february   our commitments and contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period in thousands less than more than year years years years total long term debt a deferred compensation payments operating leases other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations a represents principal and estimated interest payments under our term loan 
standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of february  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line on february  strategy and outlook our strategy is to offer world class style  quality and product value as a complete residential wood  metal and upholstered furniture resource through excellence in product design  global sourcing  manufacturing  logistics  sales  marketing and customer service 
we strive to be an industry leader in sales growth and profitability performance  thereby providing an outstanding investment for our shareholders and contributing to the well being of our employees  customers  suppliers and community neighbors 
additionally  we strive to nurture the relationship focused  team oriented and honor driven corporate culture that has distinguished our company for years 
we have been executing this strategy since in part through exiting domestic wood furniture manufacturing to concentrate on imported wood and metal and domestically produced and imported upholstered home furnishings  expanding product offerings to become a more complete and important resource to our furniture retailers through the acquisitions of upholstery manufacturers bradington young llc and sam moore llc  and in youth furniture lines through the purchase of opus designs llc and by organically expanding the styles and price points offered in existing product lines  continuing to improve and expand our supply chain capabilities  with improvements in forecasting and demand planning software and stock keeping unit sku optimization  filling key leadership positions with people who have the skill sets and experience needed under our new business model  and expanding regional distribution and service capabilities to our retailers on the us west coast through a leased facility located in the port area of southern california and all our container direct customers by adding warehousing at two important suppliers plants in china 
as the general economy has deteriorated  we have experienced a steepening decline in year over year incoming order rates and expect challenging conditions at least through our second fiscal quarter 
we believe however  that the economy may have bottomed 
we are encouraged by recent small improvements in retail sales and housing and modest gains in the equity markets 
we expect to see a slight increase in consumer confidence by the third or fourth quarter if home values stabilize and the stock market continues to rebound from its low point earlier this year 
additionally  we are optimistic that our new product introductions and merchandising programs which we will be introducing at the april market will be seen by our retailers as opportunities to stimulate business and engage consumers 
as a result  our forecasting and inventory planning includes expectations for a marginal improvement in business this fall 
we believe our financial strength has become a key differentiator that is increasingly important to our customers and suppliers  who want to be aligned with partners who can survive the current downturn  continue to invest for the future and help them emerge successfully 
our balance sheet is strong  with good liquidity  little debt and no unutilized assets 
environmental matters hooker furniture is committed to protecting the environment 
as a part of our business operations  our manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
we are in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination and visible air emissions  none of which we believe is material to our results of operations or financial position 
our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with our environmental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 
critical accounting policies and estimates hooker furniture s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that actual results will deviate materially from our estimates related to our accounting policies described below 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  we analyze the payment history of our significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general condition of the economy  we develop what we consider to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual uncollectible amounts may differ materially from our estimate 
valuation of inventories 
we value all of our inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of our inventories is determined using the dollar value  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of sales  while the inventories reported on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to adjustment to the lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of sales and lower profitability as compared to the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventory for excess or slow moving items based on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
we establish an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual values may differ materially from our estimate 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets tangible assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of those assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
the costs to dispose of these assets are recognized when we commit to a plan of disposal 
severance and related benefits paid to terminated employees affected by the closings are recorded in the period when management commits to a plan of termination 
we recognize liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of facilities are based on our best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
we reassess our accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting period 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period during which the change occurs 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we have also recorded the fair value of trade names and furniture designs assumed in business combinations as assets on our balance sheet 
intangible assets with an estimable useful life  such as furniture designs are amortized over their useful lives  while indefinite lived assets such as trade names are reported at the lower of cost or fair value 
we test these assets for impairment annually during our fiscal fourth quarter and at other times as dictated by business conditions or other facts and circumstances 
adverse business developments  specific either to our company or industry or general economic conditions  could create conditions under which we would evaluate the fair value of these business units compared to their carrying values  and if impairment is indicated  write them down to a fair value based on their expected future cash flows or market value 
to test goodwill we apply the two step approach to identify potential impairment and  if impairment exists  to determine the appropriate carrying values 
we use a combination of the income and market approaches in valuing these assets and weight the results as appropriate to each asset  and select discount rates  royalty rates and other factors which reflect current market conditions  business risk attributable to each asset or business unit and recent transactions at comparable companies 
to test trade names or trademarks we use the relief from royalty method  which values the trade name based on comparable trade names in this and similar industries 
accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
the objective of this statement is to require enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities and to improve the transparency of financial reporting 
this statement changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
this statement encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we expect to adopt this standard effective with our fiscal year first quarter  which began february  in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
r  business combinations 
the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
to accomplish that  this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer a recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption of this standard is not permitted 
consequently  we adopted the standard in our fiscal year first quarter  which began february  the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
consequently  hooker adopted the standard in our fiscal year first quarter  which began february  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
consequently  hooker adopted the standard in our fiscal year first quarter  which began february  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hooker furniture is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of interest rate swap agreements with respect to interest rates 
our obligations under our lines of credit and term loan bear interest at variable rates 
the outstanding balance under our term loan amounted to million as of february  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate of interest on our term loan at through the notional principal value of the swap agreement is substantially equal to the outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing denominated in us dollars with our foreign suppliers  for periods typically of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
most of our imports are purchased from china 
the chinese currency now floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in additional exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
we generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during affected periods
