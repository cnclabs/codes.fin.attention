on january   for million in cash and stock consideration of approximately million  we acquired nexo systems  a privately held on line sharing and group services company based in palo alto  california 
our operations and financial performance depend on general economic conditions 
the us economy recently experienced  and could continue to experience  an economic downturn due to the crisis in credit markets  slower economic activity  concerns about inflation  increased energy costs  and decreased consumer confidence  high consumer debt levels and unemployment rates and other adverse business conditions 
such fluctuations in the us economy could cause  among others  deterioration and continued decline in consumer spending and increase in the cost of labor and materials 
as a result  given the combination of the current economic conditions  very low consumer sentiment and limited discretionary funds  the economic slowdown could exacerbate the seasonal decline in sales that we typically see in the first three quarters of the calendar year 
throughout this period we intend to focus on actions that are within our control and initiatives that will increase revenue  earnings  free cash flow and long term shareholder value 
basis of presentation net revenues 
we generate revenues primarily from the printing and shipping of photo based products  such as photo books  cards and calendars  photo prints  and photo based merchandise  such as mugs  mouse pads and magnets 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  promotions redeemed by customers and other discounts 
customers place orders through our website and pay primarily using credit cards 
our personalized products and services revenues are derived from the sale of photo based products  photo based merchandise and ancillary products and services  and the related shipping revenues 
revenue from advertising displayed on our website and commercial print services are also included in personalized products and services revenue 
we believe our products and services are differentiated from other traditional photo processors by our high quality production and numerous form factors and templates  which are key to attracting and retaining customers 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in particular  we generate a substantial portion of our revenues during the holiday season in the calendar fourth quarter 
we also typically experience increases in net revenues during other shopping related seasonal events  such as easter  mother s day  father s day  and halloween 
we generally experience lower net revenues during the first  second and third calendar quarters and  have incurred and may continue to incur losses in these quarters 
due to the relatively short lead time required to fulfill product orders  usually one to three business days  order backlog is not material to our business 
to further understand net revenue trends  we monitor several key metrics including total customers 
we closely monitor total customers as a key indicator of demand 
total customers include the number of transacting customers in a given period 
we seek to expand our customer base by empowering our existing customers with sharing and collaboration services such as shutterfly gallery and shutterfly share sites  and by conducting integrated marketing and advertising programs 
total customers have increased on an annual basis for each year since inception  and we anticipate that this trend will continue 
average order value 
average order value is net revenues for a given period divided by the total number of customer orders recorded during that same period 
we seek to increase average order value as a means of increasing net revenues 
average order value has increased on an annual basis for each year since  and we anticipate that this trend will continue in the future as consumers shift from prints into personalized products and services 
total number of orders 
we closely monitor total number of orders as a leading indicator of net revenue trends 
we recognize the net revenues associated with an order when the products have been shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
orders are typically processed and shipped within two business days after a customer places an order 
total number of orders has increased on an annual basis for each year since  and we anticipate that this trend will continue in the future 
personalized products and services revenues as percentage of net revenues 
we continue to innovate and improve our personalized products and services and expect the net revenues from these products and services to increase as percentage of net revenues as we continue to diversify our product offerings 
personalized products and services as a percentage of total net revenue was in  in and in in addition  as a percentage of total net revenues  revenues from x prints have been declining  from in  to in  and to in we believe the analysis of these metrics and others provides us with important information on our overall net revenue trends and operating results 
fluctuations in these metrics are not unusual and no single factor is determinative of our net revenues and operating results 
cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues consist primarily of direct materials the majority of which consists of paper  ink  and photo book covers  payroll and related expenses for direct labor  shipping charges  packaging supplies  distribution and fulfillment activities  rent for production facilities  depreciation of production equipment  and third party costs for photo based merchandise 
cost of net revenues also includes payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in customer service 
in addition  cost of revenues includes any third party software or patents licensed  as well as the amortization of acquired developed technology and capitalized website development costs 
in  costs of net revenues also include certain costs associated with the closure of our hayward manufacturing and production facility 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist of technology and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenues 
technology and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees and contractors engaged in the development and ongoing maintenance of our website  infrastructure and software 
these expenses include depreciation of the computer and network hardware used to run our website and store the customer data  as well as amortization of purchased software 
technology and development expense also includes co location and bandwidth costs 
sales and marketing expense consists of costs incurred for marketing programs and personnel and related expenses for our customer acquisition  product marketing  business development and public relations activities 
our marketing efforts consist of various online and offline media programs  such as e mail and direct mail promotions  the purchase of keyword search terms and various strategic alliances 
we depend on these efforts to attract customers to our service 
general and administrative expense includes general corporate costs  including rent for our corporate offices  insurance  depreciation on information technology equipment and legal and accounting fees 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes personnel expenses of employees involved in executive  finance  accounting  human resources  information technology and legal roles 
third party payment processor and credit card fees are also included in general and administrative expense and have historically fluctuated based on revenues during the period 
all of the payments we have received from our intellectual property license agreements have been included as an offset to general and administrative expense 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest costs recognized under our capital lease obligations as well as costs associated with our working capital line of credit 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists of the interest earned on our cash and investment accounts as well as unrealized gains losses on our trading securities and rights that were recorded as a result of signing a settlement agreement with one of our investment advisors 
income taxes 
income taxes consist of our federal and state tax expense 
historically  we have only been subject to taxation in the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are the most critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from the printing and shipping of prints and other photo based products  advertising services and commercial print services 
we generally recognize revenues from product sales upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists typically through the use of a credit card or receipt of a check  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
revenues from amounts billed to customers  including prepaid orders  are deferred until shipment of fulfilled orders 
we provide our customers with a satisfaction guarantee whereby products can be returned within a day period for a reprint or refund 
we maintain an allowance for estimated future returns based on historical data 
during the year ended december   returns totaled less than of net revenues and have been within management s expectations 
we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers in exchange for setting up an account and to encourage purchases 
such offers include free products and percentage discounts on current purchases 
discounts  when accepted by customers  are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction and are included in net revenues 
production costs related to free products are included in costs of revenues upon redemption 
shipping charged to customers is recognized as revenue at the time of shipment 
our advertising revenues are derived from the sale of online advertisements on our website 
advertising revenues are recognized as impressions ie  the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of our websites are delivered  as clicks which are generated each time users on our websites click through our advertisements to an advertiser s designated website are provided to advertisers  or ratably over the term of the agreement with the expectation that advertisement will be delivered ratably over the contract period 
we recognize commercial print revenue upon shipment  consistent with our product revenue policy 
inventories 
our inventories consist primarily of paper  photo book covers and packaging supplies and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
the value of inventories is reduced by an estimate for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate for excess and obsolete inventories is based upon management s review of utilization of inventories in light of projected sales  current market conditions and market trends 
fair value 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
in february  the fasb issued a staff position which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for those that were recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provision of fas with respect to our financial assets and liabilities only 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under fas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measure date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under fas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three input levels  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we utilized a discounted cash flow approach to determine the level valuation for our auction rate securities 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
they represent our estimates given available data as of december  on january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value the fair value option 
if the fair value option is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  eg debt issue costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and may generally be made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
we chose not to elect the fair value option for our financial assets and liabilities existing on january   and did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities transacted during the twelve months ended december   except for the rights related to our auction rate securities that were recorded in conjunction with signing an agreement with one of our investment advisors 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we account for intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
intangible assets from acquisitions are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from one to five years 
for goodwill analysis  we operate under one reporting unit as defined by sfas no 
to determine the fair value of our reporting unit we used a discounted cash flow model  using ten years of projected unleveraged free cash flows and terminal ebitda earnings multiples 
the discount rates used for the analysis reflected a weighted average cost of capital based on industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization 
the discount rates used were also subjected to broad sensitivity analysis to ensure that fair value estimates were within a reasonable range 
the discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
as a result of this work  under the fair value measurement methodology  we concluded the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded our carrying value 
software and website development costs 
we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the aicpa statement of position no 
accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and eitf issue no 
accounting for website development costs 
accordingly  payroll and payroll related costs and stock based compensation incurred in the development phase are capitalized and amortized over the product s estimated useful life  which is generally three years 
costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for our website are expensed as incurred 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying the statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we believe that all net deferred tax assets shown on our balance sheet are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which will impact deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change in made 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
we are required to make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense 
to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately beocme payable  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for our stock based awards in accordance with fas r  which requires a fair value measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock awards 
under sfas no r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other things  estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of restricted stock awards and performance based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense is recognized for restricted stock awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
compensation expense associated with performance based restricted stock awards is recognized based on whether or not satisfaction of the performance criteria is probable 
if in the future  situations indicate that the performance criteria are not probable  then no further compensation cost will be recorded  and any previous costs will be reversed

liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands consolidated statement of cash flows data purchases of property and equipment capitalization of software and website development costs acquisition of business and intangibles  net of cash acquired depreciation and amortization cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents balances  cash generated from operations  and our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital lease obligations  expansion plans and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  operating results and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional debt or equity 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
financing arrangements may not be available to us  or may not be in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
historically we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through operations  private sales of preferred stock  our initial public offering  lease financing and the use of bank and related party loans 
as a result of our initial public offering in september  we raised approximately million of proceeds  net of underwriters discount and fees  which we received on october  at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds 
at december   million par value of our marketable securities portfolio was invested in aaa rated investments in auction rate debt securities ars 
ars investments are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically  at intervals established at the time of issuance primarily every twenty eight days  based on market demand for a reset period 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a competitive bidding process often referred to as a dutch auction 
if there is insufficient interest in the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the rates may be reset to predetermined penalty or maximum rates 
from the inception of these investments in ars in january through february  due to the recent uncertainties in the credit markets  all scheduled auctions have failed 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the securities are called by the issuer or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
as a result  we have classified the entire balance of ars as non current investments on our consolidated balance sheet 
at the time of the initial investment and through the date of this report  all of these auction rate securities remain aaa rated 
the assets underlying each security are student loans and of the principal amounts are guaranteed by the federal family education loan program ffelp 
typically  the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the ars investments no longer approximates par value 
at december   we utilized a discounted cash flow approach to determine the level valuation for the ars investments 
this analysis indicated a fair value of million 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change 
they represent our estimates given available data as of december  based on this assessment of fair value  as of december  we determined there was a decline in fair value of our ars investments of million 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment advisors  entitling us to sell at par value auction rate securities originally purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  the rights 
in accepting the rights  we also granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of ars 
although we expect to sell our ars under the rights  if the rights is not exercised before july   it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
the rights represent a contractual agreement between us and ubs that will rank senior to ubs ordinary shares 
throughout the period from acceptance of the offer until the rights are redeemed or ubs sells the securities  ars will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
the rights represents a firm agreement in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  which defines a firm agreement with an unrelated party  binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable  with the following characteristics a the agreement specifies all significant terms  including the quantity to be exchanged  the fixed price  and the timing of the transaction  and b the agreement includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable 
the enforceability of the rights resulted in the recognition of a separate freestanding asset and was accounted for separately from the ars investment 
as of december   we recorded million as the fair value of the rights  classified as long term investment on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   with a corresponding credit to interest and other income  net  in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  the rights does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas therefore  we elected to measure the rights at fair value under sfas  which permits an entity to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets  in order to match the changes in the fair value of the ars 
we valued the rights as the difference between the fair value and the original par value of the ars  adjusted for bearer risk  if any  associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded its ars as available for sale investments  and therefore recorded resulting unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
in connection with the acceptance of the ubs offer in november  resulting in a right to require ubs to purchase the ars at par value beginning on june   we have reclassified our ars subject to the right and held by ubs from available for sale to trading in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
the transfer to trading securities reflects our intent to exercise the rights during the period june  to july  prior to its agreement with ubs  our intent was to hold the ars until the earlier of anticipated recovery in market value or maturity 
at december   we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss on our auction rate securities of million in interest and other income  net  which had previously been recognized as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
any future gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the ars will be recognized in earnings 
we believe there are several significant assumptions that are utilized in our ars valuation analysis  the two most critical of which are the discount rate and the average expected term 
holding all other factors constant  if we were to increase the discount rate utilized in our valuation analysis by basis points  or one half of a percentage point  this change would have the effect of reducing the fair value of our ars by approximately million as of december  similarly  holding all other factors constant  if we were to increase the average expected term utilized in our fair value calculation by one year  this change would have the effect of reducing the fair value of our ars by approximately million as of december  we also consider credit ratings with respect to our investments provided by investment ratings agencies 
as of december   all of our investments conformed to the requirements of our investment policy  which requires that all of our investments meet high credit quality standards as defined by credit ratings of the major investment ratings agencies 
these ratings are subject to change and a downgrade in rating would adversely affect the value of our investments 
on an annual basis  for the last three years our cash flows generated from operating activities have been in excess of our capital expenditure requirements 
accordingly  we continue to believe that we have sufficient liquid capital to fund our operations and capital requirements 
as of december   we had access to our cash and cash equivalents and our other liquid investments  totaling million 
in addition  in april  to supplement our overall liquidity position  we entered into a day revolving credit facility with a financial institution to provide up to million in additional capital resources 
as of december   no amounts have been drawn against this facility 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will range between to of our expected fiscal year net revenues 
these expenditures will be used to purchase technology and equipment to support the growth in our business and to increase our production capacity and help enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer demand 
this range of capital expenditures is not outside the ordinary course of our business or materially different from how we have expanded our business in the past 
we believe that such capital expenditures will have a positive effect on our results of operations if demand increases in line with increases in our production capacity 
however  these capital expenditures will have a negative effect on our results of operations if demand does not increase as we expect  and will have a negative effect on our results of operations in the short term if demand does not increase simultaneously  as we expect  with the capital expenditures spent to support increased demand 
operating activities

contractual obligations we lease office space in redwood city  california and a production facility in charlotte  north carolina under non cancelable operating leases that expire in and  respectively 
in  we terminated the lease at our hayward  california facility effective june  which was originally scheduled to expire in september in  we entered into a non cancelable operating lease for our new phoenix  arizona facility that commenced in february and will expire in we lease website infrastructure computer and network hardware  production equipment  information technology equipment and software under various capital leases that expire through we also have co location agreements with third party hosting facilities that expire in as a result of our growth strategies  we believe that our liquidity and capital resources requirements will grow in absolute dollars but will be generally consistent with historical periods on an annual basis as a percentage of net revenues 
we anticipate leasing additional office space  production facilities and hosting facilities in future periods  consistent with our historical business model 
the following are contractual obligations at december   associated with lease obligations and other arrangements total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unrecognized tax benefits   purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations include commitments under non cancelable marketing agreements  license agreements  and third party hosting services 
other than the obligations  liabilities and commitments described above  we have no significant unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments 
we are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
as part of our june acquisition of make it about me miam  we agreed to make additional earnout payments if certain milestones are achieved 
as of december   the final earnout payment of million was earned and subsequently paid in january recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a staff position which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for those that were recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provision of fas only with respect to our financial assets and liabilities 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under fas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measure date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under fas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three input levels  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we have elected to defer the election of this pronouncement for its nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
effective january   we adopted fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
we did not elect the fair value option for our financial assets and liabilities existing on january   and did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities transacted during the twelve months ended december   except for the rights related to our auction rate securities that was recorded in conjunction with signing an agreement with one of our investment advisors 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r  business combinations fas r which replaces fas no 
and establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
fas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption of fas r is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of fas r to have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements fas which amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the amendments to arb  this statement amends fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  so that earnings per share data will continue to be calculated the same way those data were calculated before this statement was issued 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life or recognized intangible assets under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of fsp to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 accounting for defensive intangible assets eitf that clarifies accounting for defensive intangible assets subsequent to initial measurement 
eitf applies to acquired intangible assets which an entity has no intention of actively using  or intends to discontinue use of  the intangible asset but holds it locks up to prevent others from obtaining access to it ie  a defensive intangible asset 
under eitf  the task force reached a consensus that an acquired defensive asset should be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting ie  an asset separate from other assets of the acquirer  and the useful life assigned to an acquired defensive asset should be based on the period during which the asset would diminish in value 
eitf is effective for defensive intangible assets acquired in fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not expect the issuance of eitf to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk 
we have exposure to interest rate risk that relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
all of cash equivalents are carried at market value 
we do not currently use or plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were maintained by financial institutions in the united states and our deposits may be in excess of insured limits 
we believe that the financial institutions that hold our investments are financially sound and  accordingly  minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments 
at december   million par value of our marketable securities portfolio was invested in aaa rated investments in auction rate debt securities ars 
the assets underlying each security are student loans and of the principal amounts are guaranteed by the ffelp 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  one of our investment advisors  entitling us to sell at par value auction rate securities originally purchased from ubs approximately million  par value at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  the rights

the rights represent a contractual agreement between us and ubs that will rank senior to ubs ordinary shares 
throughout the period from acceptance of the offer until the rights are redeemed or ubs sells the securities  ars will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
inflation 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our current business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  for example  if the cost of our materials or the cost of shipping our products to customers were to incur substantial increases as a result of the rapid rise in the cost of oil  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
