item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading non union less than truckload ltl multi regional motor carrier providing one to five day service among six regions in the united states and next day and second day service within these regions 
more than of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to the overall health of the us domestic economy 
in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics revenue per hundredweight this measurement reflects our pricing policies  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives 
generally  freight is rated by a class system  
table of contents which is established by the national motor freight traffic association  inc light  bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense  heavy freight 
changes in the class  packaging of the freight and length of haul of the shipment can also affect this average 
fuel surcharges  accessorial charges and revenue adjustments  excluding adjustments for undelivered freight  are included in this measurement 
although we include revenue for undelivered freight in this measure  we defer such revenue for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
including deferred revenue in our revenue per hundredweight measurements matches total billed revenue with the corresponding shipments  which we believe results in a better indicator of changes in our yields 
weight per shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
however  many shippers have recently started to consolidate their shipments in an effort to reduce the impact of the high cost of fuel on their transportation costs 
in doing so  these shippers have caused an increase in our weight per shipment by shipping the same volume of goods with fewer shipments 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by monitoring this metric  we can determine our market share within these lanes of traffic and the growth potential of our service products in those markets 
revenue per shipment this measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used  in conjunction with the number of shipments we receive  to calculate total revenue  excluding adjustments for undelivered freight 
our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  generally referred to as increasing density  thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour and platform pounds handled per hour 
we believe continued improvement in density and a focus on individual account profitability are key components in our ability to sustain profitable growth 
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight  operating supplies and expenses  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 
we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network  increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes

average length of haul miles revenue per shipment we remained true to our long term strategy in by providing consistent on time service  maintaining price discipline and driving additional operating efficiencies into our processes  despite one of the most challenging operating environments we have ever experienced 
we were faced with record high fuel prices in the first half of  which contributed to the overall increase in our operating expenses 
as fuel prices began to decline  the domestic economy slipped into a recession causing significant and further declines in tonnage for the 
table of contents industry 
as a result  pricing emerged as a primary driver of competition 
while we maintained a commitment to our pricing philosophy and achieved productivity improvements  these factors were not sufficient to overcome our increased operating expenses and the negative impact of the recessionary economy 
as a result  our earnings per diluted share decreased to for and our operating ratio increased basis points to 
we believe our strategy of providing high service levels  maintaining price discipline and aggressively managing costs proved to be the best course of action in the ltl marketplace in and minimized much of the negative impact on our financial performance caused by increased competition and the downward spiral of the economy 
despite the challenges in  our revenue increased to  which was driven by a increase in total tonnage shipped and a increase in revenue per hundredweight 
the increase in tonnage shipped resulted from a increase in weight per shipment that was partially offset by a decrease in the number of shipments 
while an increase in weight per shipment is generally an indication of an improving economy  we believe the increase in is more attributable to changes in customer shipping patterns as transportation costs increased 
we believe shippers are increasingly consolidating their shipments into larger units to ship less frequently at lower costs per hundredweight 
our mix of freight in reflects growth in truckload shipments  spot quotes and container shipments  all of which have an average higher weight per shipment 
we attribute our growth in tonnage primarily to increases in market share in our existing areas of operations 
while we increased the total number of service centers in our network to at december  from at december   over of our revenue was produced from service centers open for more than one year 
as we continue to expand our geographic reach  increase our full state coverage and increase our service capabilities  we believe we will continue to gain additional market share from our existing customers and new customers who seek consistent  high quality and value driven service 
while we experienced an overall increase in tonnage for  freight demand weakened throughout the second half of the year and our tonnage declined during the fourth quarter 
we believe that freight demand in the ltl industry will not improve until there is a general recovery in the domestic economy or a significant decrease in industry capacity 
as a result  we could experience additional declines in our shipments and tonnage in revenue per hundredweight increased to from in revenue per hundredweight for reflects the impact of the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs implemented on february   as well as an increase in fuel surcharge revenue that resulted from the increase in the average price of diesel fuel during the year 
excluding fuel surcharges  revenue per hundredweight decreased in our revenue per hundredweight was also negatively impacted by the increase in weight per shipment as well as the decline in the average length of haul 
the pricing environment in the ltl industry was extremely competitive throughout the competitiveness intensified in the second half of the year as the historical seasonal increase in freight volumes did not materialize 
as a result  many carriers in our industry reduced their prices in an attempt to minimize declines in tonnage and shipment volumes 
although we increased the volume of freight moving through our service center network  we did so while maintaining our basic pricing philosophy of evaluating each individual account for profitability in an effort to maintain rational pricing for our services 
we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to pricing by keeping our service at superior levels  thus creating additional value to our customers 
we believe our rational and measured approach to the current pricing environment will be in our best long term interest 
however  a prolonged recession and competitive forces may result in some short term erosion in our pricing and shipment volumes  which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and net income 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to of revenue from in most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge  which is recorded as additional revenue  as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
these levels are generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with 
table of contents our customers 
we continuously monitor the components of our pricing  including base freight rates and fuel surcharges  and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased to of revenue in from in while we were able to improve the productivity of our linehaul  p d and platform operations  the decrease  as a percent of revenue  primarily resulted from the overall increase in revenue 
the productivity improvements  however  helped minimize the impact of the annual general wage increase provided to our workforce in september and and the deleveraging effect of the fourth quarter decline in tonnage 
driver wages decreased to of revenue in from in we were able to effectively match our labor with the changes in shipment volume during the year while also improving our productivity 
in our linehaul operations  we increased our laden load average 
p d shipments per hour and p d stops per hour increased and  respectively 
platform wages decreased to of revenue from in platform pounds handled per hour increased  primarily as a result of the increase in weight per shipment 
employee benefit costs increased to of salaries and wages in from in the increase is attributable to rising group health and dental costs  which increased to of total salary and wages in from  and increased costs associated with our paid time off for employees 
we experienced an increase in the severity of our health claims in  which resulted in a increase in claim payments as compared to operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase is primarily due to the significant rise in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses 
these costs increased during the year as a result of a significant increase in the price of diesel fuel and  to a lesser extent  a increase in gallons consumed 
we were able to minimize our consumption of fuel in by implementing several initiatives designed to improve our miles per gallon 
we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 
depreciation and amortization remained consistent at of revenue for both and we continued to make significant investments in our service center network and revenue equipment in we purchased eleven service centers and also completed several expansion projects to existing service centers to increase the overall capacity of our service center network 
we reduced our capital expenditures for revenue equipment in as compared to our purchases in recent years to appropriately match our fleet size with freight demands 
we also incurred an increase in building and office equipment rents to of revenue from for  due to an increase in both the number and size of leased facilities 
other expense  net increased to of revenue from of revenue in the increase reflects the decline in the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to the company s non qualified deferred compensation plans 
the cash value of these contracts was unfavorably impacted by the decline in equity markets during our effective tax rate for was compared to in our effective tax rate was lower in as a result of the favorable impact of alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations that we became eligible for in and  to a lesser extent  the resolution of various state tax matters in the first quarter of that decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we expect the alternative fuel tax credits will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate until these credits are no longer available in our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items

average length of haul miles revenue per shipment our financial results were reflective of a difficult operating environment that became increasingly competitive in terms of pricing throughout the year 
despite the general weakness in the domestic economy and resulting competitive pricing environment  we were able to increase revenue by to  in and increase our total tonnage shipped by 
these accomplishments were the result of the consistent execution of our business strategies in the ltl marketplace  which resulted in increased market share 
we also maintained our revenue focus on increasing density  which resulted in producing over of our revenue from service centers open for more than one year and an overall increase in average revenue per service center of 
despite our growth in revenue and tonnage during  we were unable to increase our pricing sufficiently to overcome increased operating costs  particularly with respect to the increased cost of diesel fuel 
as a result  net income decreased to  in and our operating ratio increased to from in nevertheless  our slightly higher operating ratio in was the second best we have achieved since becoming a public company in and reflected our continued focus on managing costs during a period of slower growth and continued gains in efficiency throughout our operations 
our revenue growth in was the result of a growth in shipments and a increase in revenue per shipment 
the increase in revenue per shipment consists of increases in both weight per shipment and revenue per hundredweight of and  respectively  from our tonnage increased over from the combination of increases in shipments and weight per shipment 
we believe our growth is attributable to our ability to offer a one source solution for shippers regional and inter regional needs by providing these services through one company  in contrast to many of our principal competitors 
additionally  the expansion of our geographic footprint  as well as increased full state coverage  has positioned us to become a better shipping alternative for more and more shippers 
the increase in weight per shipment in  despite the economic environment  was indicative of our success in gaining market share from larger national shippers 
while most of our revenue growth is derived from service centers open for more than one year  the expansion of our service center network and improvement in our service capabilities should provide a platform for future growth 
we increased the total number of service centers in our network to at december  from at december  revenue growth from geographic expansion typically results in additional freight moving through our existing service center network  which helps to offset lower profit margins that typically accompany new service center openings 
revenue per hundredweight increased to from in and includes the impact of the general rate increase on our base rates and minimum charges for certain tariffs we implemented on march  our revenue per hundredweight in was negatively impacted by a competitive pricing environment that progressively worsened in the second half of the year and an increase in weight per shipment 
as a result of a 
table of contents general slowdown in the domestic economy and a reduction in freight shipped during  many carriers in our industry reduced their prices to increase or maintain tonnage and shipment volumes 
while we increased the volume of freight moving through our service center network  we followed our basic pricing philosophy of evaluating each individual account for profitability in an effort to maintain rational pricing for our services 
we implemented a general rate increase effective february  in an effort to maintain our disciplined pricing approach  however  a prolonged slowdown in the domestic economy or recession may lead to additional pressure on our pricing metrics and negatively impact our net income and margins 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to of revenue from in our tariffs and contracts generally provide for a fuel surcharge as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels  which are generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
this surcharge is recorded as additional revenue and was implemented to offset significant fluctuations in the price of diesel fuel  which is one of the larger components of our operating supplies and expenses 
because of the sustained increase in diesel fuel costs and other petroleum based products  our freight pricing strategy  as well as that in the ltl industry  has evolved such that the fuel surcharge is one of many components in the overall price for our transportation services 
we continuously monitor the components of our pricing  including fuel surcharges  to minimize any negative impact to our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in diesel fuel prices 
salaries  wages and benefits increased to of revenue in from in driver wages increased to of revenue from in and employee benefit costs increased to of revenue from in  primarily due to higher group health costs and increased costs for our employee paid time off plans 
these increases were partially offset by decreased wages for salaried and clerical employees  primarily due to a reduction in bonuses 
bonus payments are generally based on multiple factors including growth in revenue  on time service and or income before taxes 
our revenue increased in as compared to in and net income decreased slightly 
while our driver wages increased as a percent of revenue  we were able to utilize our own equipment and labor to decrease our reliance on purchased transportation services from other motor carriers and railroads to of revenue from in these services are primarily utilized when there are capacity restraints or imbalances in freight flow within our service center network or when it is economically beneficial 
in addition to the increased use of our workforce for linehaul services  we provided annual pay increases to our driver workforce in september and  which we seek to recover through increases in the pricing for our services and productivity improvements in our linehaul and p d operations 
we realized productivity improvements in  as our linehaul load factor improved  p d stops per hour improved and p d shipments per hour improved 
our p d operations continue to benefit from the additional density caused by growth in tonnage  the efficiencies in our route planning through the use of our p d route optimization software and the use of our driver handheld computers 
despite these productivity gains  our price increases were not sufficient in overcoming our wage increases and the decrease in purchased transportation 
operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase is primarily due to an increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  which increased to of revenue from in the increase in these costs is a result of a increase in the average price per gallon of diesel fuel and an increase in consumption 
the consumption increase also resulted in an increase in our fuel taxes  which primarily accounts for the change in our operating taxes and licenses 
we currently do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are thus subject to market price fluctuations 
we made significant investments in revenue equipment and real estate in to increase the capacity of our fleet and support our planned growth in shipments 
as a result of these investments  as well as lower shipment growth than originally forecasted for  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in from in interest expense  net of interest income  increased to  for from  for this increase is primarily due to an increased average balance outstanding on our long term debt resulting from the 
table of contents two separate issuances of privately placed senior notes under the note purchase agreement entered into on april  in addition  interest income decreased  in due to a decline in the average balance of cash equivalents and short term investments 
the effective average tax equivalent yield  excluding state tax benefits  on our short term investments was and for and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for was compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the impact of alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations that we became eligible for in and  to a lesser extent  the resolution of various state tax matters in the first quarter of that decreased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we expect the alternative fuel tax credits will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate until these credits are no longer available in our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items 
liquidity and capital resources a summary of our cash flows is presented below in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year we have three primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement described below 
at december   cash and short term investments decreased to  from  at december  despite the current economic environment  we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations  together with our  senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other available methods of financing  will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs 
we believe we also have sufficient access to the capital markets to provide another source of liquidity  if needed 
however  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all 
capital expenditures the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment  including those obtained through acquisition of business assets and capital leases  for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other proceeds from sale total 
table of contents our capital expenditure requirements are based primarily upon expansion in the size and number of service center facilities  our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth 
in order to support these requirements  we purchased property and equipment of  and paid  to acquire certain business assets through acquisitions 
these expenditures were completely funded by cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in were lower than and  as we were able to effectively utilize our existing fleet in to meet our freight demands 
as a result  our purchases were limited to replacing a portion of the equipment being retired through the normal replacement cycle  as compared to the capital expenditures in and  when we both replaced equipment and increased capacity to support our growth and geographic expansion 
we currently project capital expenditures  net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions  to be approximately  for the year ending december  of our capital expenditures  approximately  is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers to replace equipment at the end of its useful life  approximately  is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities  and approximately  is allocated for investments in technology 
we expect to fund a substantial majority of these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations and the liquidation of our cash and short term investments 
financing agreements we have a  senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement that matures on august  the credit agreement 
wachovia bank  national association wachovia serves as administrative agent for the lenders  which also include bank of america  na  branch banking and trust company  suntrust bank  us bank  national association  and high point bank and trust company 
of the  line of credit commitments   may be used for letters of credit and  may be used for borrowings under wachovia s sweep program 
the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of  or initiates overnight investments for excess cash balances 
in addition  we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of  in minimum increments of  at our option  revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the higher of wachovia s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum  b libor one  two  three or six months plus an applicable margin adjusted libor rate  or c one month libor plus an applicable margin libor index rate 
the applicable margin is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from to 
the applicable margin for the credit agreement in was 
revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 
in december  wachovia corporation merged with wells fargo company 
pursuant to the merger  wells fargo company acquired all of wachovia corporation s business and obligations 
of the total  line of credit commitments from all lenders  wachovia has committed  we do not expect this merger to have an impact on wachovia s commitment under the credit agreement or our ability to access available funds 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants  including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
any future wholly owned subsidiaries of the company would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit facility and there was  of outstanding letters of credit relating primarily to our self insured obligations 
commitment fees ranging from to are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement 
letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter 
the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were and  respectively  for the credit 
table of contents agreement in in addition  a facing fee at an annual rate of is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 
we have two unsecured senior note agreements outstanding totaling  at december  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities in and  of which  is due in the next twelve months 
interest rates on these notes are fixed at and 
the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was and at december  and  respectively 
with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement  if any  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility 
we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i  ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year  or iii an amount equal to of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in or  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
despite current macroeconomic and credit conditions  we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future  and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long term capital needs 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations  exclusive of interest capital lease obligations  exclusive of interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations include long term debt consisting primarily of senior notes totaling  capital lease obligations for computer equipment  operating leases primarily consisting of real estate leases  and purchase obligations relating to non cancellable purchase orders for equipment scheduled for delivery in please refer to the information regarding interest rates in this section above and also in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these critical accounting policies are further described in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract  our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers 
generally  this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment 
for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period 
under this method  we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment s standard delivery time schedule 
this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables  our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers 
write offs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 
we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections  customer allowances  money back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations 
we use historical experience  trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 
management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods 
as such  we do not anticipate any near term changes in our methodologies for these estimates 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health not covered by insurance 
the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability and group health  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance between self insurance and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical claims development experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
currently  estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which generally results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base  which is generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
volatility in the price of diesel fuel  independent of inflation  has impacted our business  as described in this report 
however  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans  if any  under our credit agreement  which have variable interest rates 
a basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results 
we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that are creditworthy to minimize credit risk 
we are exposed to interest rate and market risk related to our short term investments  which include variable rate demand obligations as of december  however  we invest in high quality investment grade securities with interest reset periods generally between to days 
a basis point decrease in the average interest rate on our short term investments would have no material effect on our operating results 
the majority of our excess cash is now invested in money market funds that are included in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheets 
we have not experienced any losses in the investment of our cash in money market funds or short term investments 
at december   the company did not own any auction rate securities 
we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to company owned life insurance contracts on certain employees 
at december   the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was  of the total  of cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheet in other assets 
variable life insurance contracts expose the company to fluctuations in equity markets  however  we utilize a third party to manage these assets and minimize that exposure 
a change in market value in those investments would have a  impact on our operating income 
we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges
