poor economic conditions  which were initially evident within the residential housing market beginning in  spread throughout most sectors of the economy in the values of various assets  including loans  investment securities and intangible assets  declined significantly in the current year  resulting in a number of significant charges to earnings 
despite these setbacks and the expectation of a challenging economy at least in the short term the corporation believes it is positioned to withstand the current conditions through its strong capital and liquidity positions  conservative underwriting of loans and prudent management of interest rate risk 
summary financial results the corporation generates the majority of its revenue through net interest income  or the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon balance sheet growth and or maintaining or increasing the net interest margin  which is net interest income fully taxable equivalent as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
the corporation also generates revenue through fees earned on the various services and products offered to its customers and through sales of assets  such as loans  investments  or properties 
offsetting these revenue sources are provisions for credit losses on loans  operating expenses and income taxes

management believes that the allowance for loan losses balance of million as of december  is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio on that date and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards

table of contents critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for credit losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with its lending activities through the allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments  the balance of which is included in other liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic charge to earnings  which is necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to its proper balance 
the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance through a methodology that consists of the following identifying loans for individual review under statement in general  these consist of large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages that are rated less than satisfactory based upon the corporation s internal credit rating process 
assessing whether the loans identified for review under statement are impaired 
that is  whether it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for loans reviewed under statement  calculating the estimated fair value  using observable market prices  discounted cash flows or the value of the underlying collateral 
classifying all non impaired large balance loans based on credit risk ratings and allocating an allowance for loan losses based on appropriate factors  including recent loss history for similar loans 
identifying all smaller balance homogeneous loans for evaluation collectively under the provisions of statement in general  these loans include residential mortgages  consumer loans  installment loans  commercial loans and commercial mortgages rated satisfactory or better  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
statement loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on recent loss history and other relevant information 
reviewing the results to determine the appropriate balance of the allowance for credit losses 
this review gives additional consideration to factors such as the mix of loans in the portfolio  the balance of the allowance relative to total loans and non performing assets  trends in the overall risk profile of the portfolio  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and local and national economic conditions 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the inherent imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
documenting the results of its review in accordance with sab the allowance review methodology is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
accounting for business combinations the corporation accounts for all business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement 
purchase accounting requires the purchase price to be allocated to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
it also requires assessing the existence of and  if necessary  assigning a value to certain intangible assets 
the remaining excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price is established as the value of securities issued for the acquisition  cash consideration paid and certain acquisition related expenses 
the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are typically established through appraisals  observable market values or discounted cash flows 
management has engaged independent third party valuation experts to assist in valuing certain assets  particularly intangibles 
other assets and liabilities are generally valued using the corporation s internal asset liability modeling system 
the assumptions used and the final valuations  whether prepared internally or by a third party  are reviewed by management 
due to the complexity of purchase accounting  final determinations of values can be time consuming and  occasionally  amounts included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations are based on preliminary estimates of value 

table of contents all acquisitions consummated with an effective date of january  or later will be accounted for under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations statement r 
the statement establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statement the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives 
some intangible assets have indefinite lives and are  therefore  not amortized 
all intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment if certain events occur 
any impairment write downs are recognized as expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill is not amortized to expense  but is evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the corporation completes its annual goodwill impairment test as of october st of each year 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair values are less than the book values  an additional valuation procedure is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
in  the corporation recorded a million goodwill impairment charge due to one of its defined reporting units failing the annual impairment test and based on the additional valuation procedures performed 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during and for additional details related to the corporation s goodwill impairment  see note f  goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  selection of comparable market transactions  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  an impairment test between annual tests is necessary 
such events may include adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse actions by a regulator  unauthorized competition  the loss of key employees  or similar events 
the corporation has not performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the past three years as no such events have occurred 
however  such an interim test could be necessary in the future 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income before income taxes  adjusted for the effect of certain tax exempt income and non deductible expenses 
in addition  certain items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate 
the corporation must also evaluate the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if any such assets are more likely than not to not be recovered  a valuation allowance must be recognized 
the corporation recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  for certain state net operating losses that are not expected to be recovered 
the assessment of the carrying value of deferred tax assets is based on certain assumptions  changes in which could have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements

table of contents fair value measurements on january   the corporation adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurement statement for all assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following three categories from highest to lowest priority level inputs that represent quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs that represent quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  or quoted prices for identical instruments in non active markets 
also includes valuation techniques whose inputs are derived principally from observable market data other than quoted prices  such as interest rates or other market corroborated means 
level inputs that are largely unobservable  as little or no market data exists for the instrument being valued 
as required by statement  the corporation has categorized all financial assets and liabilities and all nonfinancial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the above three levels 
in addition  the corporation has categorized all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis into the above three levels 
see note p  fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the disclosures required by statement in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of statement in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fsp was effective upon issuance for the corporation 
the corporation applied the provisions of fsp to certain debt security investments for which there was no active market 
the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities categorized as level assets requires a great deal of subjectivity due to the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  determining when a market is no longer active and placing little or no reliance on distressed market prices requires the use of management s judgment 
the need for greater management judgment in determining fair values for level assets and liabilities has further been heightened by the current challenging economic conditions  which have resulted in a great deal of volatility in the fair values of investment securities 
the corporation engages third party valuation experts to assist in valuing most of the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis which are classified as level or level items  including available for sale investment securities  guarantee liabilities associated with the corporation s commitment to purchase arcs from customer accounts and hedged certificates of deposits and their related interest rate swaps

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  debt security market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity and debt market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
as of december   the corporation s equity investments consisted of fhlb and federal reserve bank stock million  common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions million  and money market mutual funds and other equity investments million 
the equity investments most susceptible to equity market price risk are the financial institutions stocks  which had an adjusted cost basis of million and a fair value of million as of december  gross unrealized gains and losses in this portfolio were approximately million and million as of december   respectively 
although the carrying value of financial institution stocks accounted for less than of the corporation s total assets as of december   the corporation has a history of realizing gains from this portfolio 
however  significant declines in the values of financial institution stocks held in this portfolio have not only impacted the corporation s ability to realize gains on their sale in and  but have also resulted in significant other than temporary impairment charges 
the corporation has evaluated whether any unrealized losses on individual equity investments constituted other than temporary impairment  which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
based on the results of such evaluations  the corporation recorded write downs of million in   in  and  in for specific equity securities which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
in addition  the corporation recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and  for a mutual fund investment and other government agency sponsored stocks  respectively  in additional impairment charges may be necessary depending upon the performance of the equity markets in general and the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see also note c  investment securities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
another source of equity market price risk is the corporation s investment in fhlb stock 
the corporation is required to own fhlb stock in order to borrow funds from the fhlb 
fhlbs obtain funding primarily through issuance of consolidated obligations of the federal home loan bank system 
the us government does not guarantee these obligations  and each of the fhlb banks is generally jointly and severally liable for repayment of each other s debt 
recently  the fhlb system has experienced financial stress  and some of the regional banks within the fhlb system have suspended or reduced their dividends  or eliminated the ability of members to redeem capital stock 
the ultimate impact of these developments on the fhlb system or its programs for advances to members is uncertain 
the corporation s fhlb stock and its ability to obtain fhlb funds could be adversely impacted if the financial health of the fhlb system worsens 
in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust and brokerage revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if the values of those investment portfolios decrease  whether due to factors influencing us securities markets in general  or otherwise  the corporation s revenue would be negatively impacted 
in addition  the corporation s ability to sell its brokerage services is dependent  in part  upon consumers level of confidence in the outlook for rising securities prices 
debt security price risk debt security market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of debt security investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s debt security investments consist primarily of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations whose principal payments are guaranteed by us government sponsored agencies  state and municipal securities  us government sponsored and us government debt securities  auction rate 
table of contents certificates and corporate debt securities 
only the auction rate certificates and corporate debt securities have significant debt security price risk 
auction rate certificates arcs beginning in the second quarter of  the corporation s debt securities included arcs purchased from customers 
due to the current market environment  these arcs are susceptible to significant market price risk 
as of december   arcs had a cost basis of million and fair value of million  or of total assets 
arcs are long term securities structured to allow their sale in periodic auctions  resulting in both the treatment of arcs as short term instruments in normal market conditions and fair values that could be derived based on periodic auction prices 
however  beginning in mid february  market auctions for these securities began to fail due to an insufficient number of buyers  resulting in an illiquid market 
this illiquidity has resulted in recent market prices that represent forced liquidations or distressed sales and do not provide an accurate basis for fair value 
therefore  as of december   the fair value of the arc securities held by the corporation were derived using significant unobservable inputs based on an expected cash flow model which produced fair values which were materially different from those that would be expected from settlement of these investments in the illiquid market that presently exists 
the expected cash flow model produced fair values which assumed a return to market liquidity sometime within the next three to five years 
if liquidity does not return within a time frame that is materially consistent with the corporation s assumptions  the fair value of arcs could significantly change 
the credit quality of the underlying debt associated with the arcs is also a factor in the determination of their estimated fair value 
as of december   the total combined estimated fair value of arcs held by the corporation and arcs held within customers accounts was approximately million  with million held by the corporation  as stated above 
approximately of the approximately million of arcs are backed by student loans  while the remaining arcs are backed by state and municipal securities 
approximately of the student loan arcs have credit ratings of aaa  with a majority of the remaining aa rated 
the current illiquid market did not impact the credit risk associated with the assets underlying the arcs  both those held by the corporation and those that remain in customer accounts 
therefore  as of december   the risk of changes in the estimated fair values of arcs due to deterioration in the credit quality of their underlying debt instruments is not significant 
corporate debt securities the corporation holds corporate debt securities in the form of pooled trust preferred securities  single issuer trust preferred securities and subordinated debt issued by financial institutions  as presented in the following table december  amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands single issuer trust preferred securities subordinated debt pooled trust preferred securities total corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions single issuer trust preferred securities with estimated fair values totaling million as of december  are classified as level assets 
see note p  fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
historically  the corporation determined the fair value of these securities based on prices received from third party brokers and pricing agencies who determined fair values using both quoted prices for similar assets  when available  and model based valuation techniques that derived fair value based on market corroborated data  such as instruments with similar prepayment speeds and default interest rates 
the corporation has determined that the market for pooled trust preferred securities and certain single issuer trust preferred securities held by the corporation was not active 
consistent with staff position no 
 the corporation determined  through the use of a third party valuation specialist  the fair value of its investments in pooled trust preferred securities using a discounted cash flows 
table of contents model  which applied a credit and liquidity adjusted discount rate to expected cash flows 
for certain single issuer trust preferred securities  the corporation determined fair values based on quotes provided by third party brokers who determined fair values based predominantly on internal valuation models and were not indicative prices or binding offers 
in  the corporation recorded million of other than temporary impairment charges related to investments in pooled trust preferred securities 
in addition  the corporation recorded a million other than temporary impairment charge related to subordinated debt issued by a failed financial institution 
the current illiquid market for debt securities issued by financial institutions may continue to impact the fair values of these securities 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in the future depending upon the performance of the individual investments held by the corporation 
see note p  fair value measurements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to the fair values of debt securities 
interest rate risk  asset liability management and liquidity interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net interest income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a bi weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net interest income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the cash needs of its customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments and through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
the corporation also maintains secondary sources that provide liquidity on a secured and unsecured basis to meet short term needs 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide details related to the corporation s sources and uses of cash 
the corporation generated million in cash from operating activities during  mainly due to net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges such as the provision for loan losses  goodwill impairment and investment securities losses 
investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million in due to the purchase of investment securities and the net increase in loans exceeding the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
financing activities resulted in net cash proceeds of million in  compared to net cash proceeds of million in as net funds provided by the issuance of preferred stock  additions of long tern debt and increases in time deposits exceeded net repayments of short term borrowings and decreases in demand and savings accounts  and shareholder dividends 
liquidity must also be managed at the fulton financial corporation parent company level 
for safety and soundness reasons  banking regulations limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the parent company in the form of loans and dividends 
generally  these limitations are based on the subsidiary banks regulatory capital levels and their net income 
the parent company meets its cash needs through dividends and loans from subsidiary banks  and through external borrowings 
management continues to monitor the liquidity and capital needs of the parent company and will implement appropriate strategies  as necessary  to remain well capitalized and to meet its cash needs 
as of december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  federal funds sold  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets  as compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  
table of contents the following tables present the expected maturities of investment securities as of december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost held to maturity at amortized cost maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal corporate debt securities total mortgage backed securities available for sale at estimated fair value maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities us government sponsored agency securities state and municipal auction rate securities corporate debt securities total collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of and statutory interest expense disallowances 
maturities for mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
includes small business administration securities  whose maturities are dependent upon prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  amounts are based upon contractual maturities 
maturities of auction rate securities are based on contractual maturities 
see note o  commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to auction rate securities 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations which have stated maturities that may differ from actual maturities due to borrowers ability to prepay obligations 
cash flows from such investments are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgage loans and are generally influenced by the level of interest rates 
as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans decrease 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase

contractual maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding as of december  are as follows in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months total each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
as of december   the corporation had billion in overnight and term advances outstanding from the fhlb with an additional billion of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity 
the corporation maintains liquidity sources in the form of core demand and savings deposits  time deposits in various denominations  including jumbo and brokered time deposits  repurchase agreements and short term promissory notes 
during the fourth quarter of  a combination of commercial real estate loans  commercial loans and securities were pledged to the federal reserve bank of philadelphia to provide access to overnight federal reserve bank borrowings under the discount window and term borrowings under the federal reserve bank s term auction facility 
as of december   the corporation had billion of collateralized borrowing availability at the discount window and term auction facility and no outstanding borrowings 

table of contents the following table provides information about the corporation s interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
the table presents expected cash flows and weighted average rates for each significant interest rate sensitive financial instrument  by expected maturity period dollars in thousands 
expected maturity period estimated beyond total fair value fixed rate loans average rate floating rate loans average rate fixed rate investments average rate floating rate investments average rate other interest earning assets average rate total average rate fixed rate deposits average rate floating rate deposits average rate fixed rate borrowings average rate floating rate borrowings average rate total average rate amounts are based on contractual payments and maturities  adjusted for expected prepayments 
amounts are based on contractual maturities  adjusted for expected prepayments on mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and expected calls on agency and municipal securities 
amounts are based on contractual maturities of time deposits 
estimated based on history of deposit flows 
amounts are based on contractual maturities of debt instruments  adjusted for possible calls 
amounts also include junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
amounts include federal funds purchased  short term promissory notes  floating fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which mature in less than days  in addition to junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
line of credit amounts are based on historical cash flow assumptions  with an average life of approximately years 
the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily reflect the net interest income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
fair market value adjustments related to acquisitions are not included in the preceding table 
included within the billion of floating rate loans above are billion of loans  or of the total  that float with the prime interest rate  billion  or  of loans which float with other interest rates  primarily libor  and billion  or  of adjustable rate loans 
the billion of adjustable rate loans include loans that are fixed rate instruments for a certain period of time  and then convert to floating rates 

table of contents the following table presents the percentage of adjustable rate loans  stratified by their remaining fixed term at december  percent of total adjustable rate fixed rate term loans one year two years three years four years five years greater than five years the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rate relationships 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the sum of assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having no contractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations includes the effect of expected prepayments  based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative six month ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities rsa rsl to a range of to 
as of december   the cumulative six month ratio of rsa rsl was 
while the rsa rsl is within policy limits at december   the corporation is taking measures to reduce its static gap position  which is at its current level due primarily to the receipt of million in cpp funds on december   which reduced the corporation s overnight borrowings 
simulation of net interest income and net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios are used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for a basis point shock in interest rates  for a basis point shock and for a basis point shock 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve based upon changes in the prime rate 
the shocks do not take into account changes in customer behavior that could result in changes to mix and or volumes in the balance sheet nor do they account for competitive pricing over the forward month period 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current level of interest rates  the and basis point downward shock scenarios are not shown annual change in net interest rate shock income change bp million bp million bp million bp million economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates 
as of december   the corporation was within economic value of equity policy limits
