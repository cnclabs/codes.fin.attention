item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
for a variety of reasons  including those described in forward looking statements and risk factors  our actual results may differ materially from these estimates and projections 
since the first avenue fibertower merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  our historical financial statements for periods prior to the first avenue fibertower merger are the historical financial statements of old fibertower and include the results of first avenue from and after the first avenue fibertower merger 
as a result  our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future results of operations 
company overview we provide backhaul services to wireless carriers and began generating service revenues in by deploying our first network in dallas  texas 
backhaul is the transport of voice  video and data traffic from a wireless carrier s mobile base station  or cell site  to its mobile switching center or other exchange point where the traffic is then switched onto a fixed wireline telecommunications network 
we 
table of contents compete with a range of diversified telecommunications services providers  primarily incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  including at t  verizon  embarq  and qwest 
as of december   we had employees 
on may   management announced staffing reductions throughout the company as part of its cost reduction efforts 
see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we have master service agreements with six of the eight largest us wireless carriers and market our services in markets solely in the us through our direct sales force 
as an important part of our business strategy  we seek to leverage our existing network and customer relationships by increasing utilization of existing assets  continue to improve the efficiencies of our network and reduce network expenses  sell additional bandwidth to our customers  expand our markets based on identified demand  continue to develop innovative solutions that meet the needs of our customers  and allocate capital efficiently by balancing new site and market growth 
the growth of our business depends substantially on the condition of the wireless communications industry 
the willingness of customers to purchase our services is affected by numerous factors  including market demand for wireless services  availability of alternative services at better prices  predictability of our deployment schedules  and quality of our services 
in order to provide backhaul services to our customers  we have constructed networks in markets 
as we continue to expand our markets  we incur significant upfront costs for pre development site evaluation  site leases  cost of new capital equipment and construction costs 
these expenses are incurred well in advance of receiving revenues from customers 
beginning in late  in order to shorten the time a customer had to wait between commitment and initial service delivery  we implemented a strategy to deploy networks where not all sites had committed customer orders at the start of deployment 
we altered this strategy in early to only construct networks where the substantial majority of sites had a committed customer 
however  as a consequence of our previous strategy  we have an inventory of sites where t equivalents are available following completion of a deployment project  including some sites where no t equivalents are being used to deliver services or generate revenues 
during  we achieved the following significant financial and operational milestones average monthly revenue per billing site grew to  in from  in  billing customer locations grew to  at december  from  at december   billing sites grew to  at december  from  at december   adjusted ebitda improved to a loss of million in from million in 
table of contents as of december   we had deployed  sites  of which  had billing customers 
a deployed site may not yet be billing for various reasons including we have sold service at that site  but have not yet commenced providing service to the customer  or we have not yet sold any service at that site  but the site is located in a market in which wireless carriers who are our customers operate but with whom we may not have yet secured a commitment for this specific market 
sites where we have sold service but not yet commenced providing service may be subject to factors including the customer is not yet able to take delivery of the t equivalent  other elements of the network between the site and the drop off location are not yet constructed  so service cannot yet be delivered  or during certain periods in certain markets  we may complete construction of sites at a faster rate than the services associated with those sites can be provided to the customer  resulting in a temporary increase in the number of sites not yet billing 
our business plan depends on our expectation that most  if not all  sites will generate revenue at some future date sufficient to fully recover our investment in property and equipment 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from these sites in the future  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we have recognized relatively limited amounts of revenues to date  have generated operating and net losses and negative cash flows and expect to generate operating and net losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
service revenues we generate revenue by charging a monthly recurring charge based on the amount of bandwidth traffic carried across our network 
increasing revenues on a per billing site basis is one of our most important objectives 
revenue per billing site  shown in the performance measures table below  is a key operating metric reflecting our ability to scale and leverage our existing network 
the duration of our customer contracts are generally for three or five years 
traffic grows as we construct new sites for customers  sell to new customers at existing sites  or sell incremental bandwidth to existing customers 
the average monthly revenue generated per billing site increased from  in to  in we intend to continue to focus on site level margins and project return on investment calculations and maintain our focus on cost reductions 
for the years ended december   and  the following customers accounted for a significant portion of our revenues  as follows at t mobility sprint nextel t mobile in december  clearwire corporation completed a transaction with sprint nextel and an investor group to launch a new wimax based wireless services provider 
as a result of this transaction  a portion of the circuits previously billed to sprint nextel have been transferred to clearwire 
if this transaction had occurred on january   approximately of our revenues would have been attributed to clearwire and approximately would have been attributed to sprint nextel 

table of contents accounts receivable from these customers comprised the following percentages of our total accounts receivable balances at december  and at t mobility sprint nextel t mobile costs and expenses the major components of our cost of service revenues are leasing 
we incur charges for site lease expense for space leased at our sites 
for lease arrangements that have rent escalation provisions  we account for lease expense on a straight line basis over the lease term 
fiber service providers 
we pay charges to our fiber service providers for the purchase and lease of fiber 
field technicians 
these are charges primarily of engineering and maintenance personnel expenses including stock based compensation 
other 
this includes costs for site evaluation and design  site maintenance  power  program and project management  costs related to unsuccessful site acquisitions that are incurred during deployment and personnel costs to monitor the network 
we expect cost of service revenues to increase in future periods as we execute our business plan to grow our network operations 
construction of our network operations is a complex process involving the interaction and assembly of multiple components including internal labor  third party costs and equipment costs 
we regularly assess the realizability of costs accumulated in construction in progress as we execute our network build plans 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to this process which is included in cost of services revenues for the year ended december  in  we conducted a re design and implementation of enhanced internal controls associated with property and equipment that we completed in the fourth quarter of as a result of this effort and our normal realizability assessment process  we recorded an impairment charge of million in to reduce network equipment and construction in progress to net realizable value 
during the third quarter of  we suspended development activities in the carolina s market and recorded impairment and other charges of million 
see note  impairment of long lived assets and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on both charges included in cost of service revenues for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and related benefits  including stock based compensation and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and related benefits including stock based compensation  recruiting fees  travel expenses  professional fees and insurance 
we do not expect general and administrative expenses to grow during depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation related to the deployment of network sites and the amortization of certain intangible assets 
we expect depreciation expense to increase in future periods as a result of deploying and commencing depreciation on additional sites 

table of contents during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million as a result of management s decision to restructure our operations to reflect changes in our strategic plan designed to reduce costs 
the resultant restructuring charge reflects i management s decision to cease market development activities in the carolina s market resulting in an exit plan for our site operating leases  ii termination benefits under a workforce reduction of employees consistent with our current network deployment plan and iii the consequent termination or renegotiation of excess office space including the former headquarters in new jersey 
see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as a result of the impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of of the carrying value of our fcc licenses  it was determined that the fair value of our fcc licenses was less than its carrying value 
consequently  the carrying value of our fcc licenses was reduced by million in the fourth quarter of to million at december  further impairment evaluations of our fcc licenses could lead to additional material impairment charges 
see note  impairment of fcc licenses and note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as a result of a further decline in our market equity value during the quarter ended march   we believed an indicator of further impairment of goodwill existed and  accordingly  performed an interim review of the value of our goodwill 
in the quarter ended march   we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million  reducing the fair value of goodwill to zero at march  the carrying value of goodwill was reduced by million and million in impairment charges recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
see note  impairment of goodwill  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest income and interest expense is primarily the result of interest earned on investment of cash proceeds and interest cost incurred as a result of the million of gross proceeds from the notes 
see note  convertible senior secured notes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
challenges facing our business in addition to the risks described in the section entitled risk factors  in item a of this report  there are various challenges facing our business 
these include acquiring new customers on new and existing sites  deploying new sites in a predictable manner  scaling our business and managing growth  the concentrated nature of our customers  the emerging nature of our market  the weakened state of the us economy and the decline in our stock price 
acquiring customers on new and existing sites in a timely fashion is critical to the generation of an appropriate return on the capital that we invest  particularly since we incur significant costs in preparing sites to become operational 
in many cases  these costs are incurred well in advance of having committed revenue from a customer 
our business  financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected if we do not obtain sufficient revenues from constructed sites 
deploying new sites in a predictable manner can be challenging given the difficulties in dealing with numerous landlords in order to lease space on sites  complying with the various zoning and permitting laws of different cities or districts  and managing the contractors involved with construction  program and project management 
we have taken steps to reduce deployment unpredictability by engaging with large  well established  turnkey vendors that are experienced in this area 
additionally  we concentrate on selecting sites owned by major tower operators with whom we already have agreements  which we believe will help minimize the risk of failing to negotiate a definitive lease for a site 

table of contents we are a rapidly growing company  and hiring qualified personnel and developing processes and systems rapidly are necessary in order to grow successfully 
if we cannot hire qualified employees  manage our growth and develop these systems and processes successfully  our business would be adversely affected 
we are a relatively new entrant into a highly concentrated market with few potential customers in any particular market 
maintaining and growing our existing relationships with the leading wireless carriers and developing new relationships with other carriers are critical to our success 
we operate in an emerging market 
our future success depends on an increased demand for wireless services for voice and other mobile broadband services such as transmissions of photos or videos and internet communication 
we have built flexibility into our spending  reducing capital expenditures  general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses 
however  our ability to pay our expenses and make full payments due on our notes depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  legislative and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the overall weakness in the us economy may inhibit our ability to grow at the level needed to fully service our notes as scheduled 
in addition  the sharp decline in our stock price may create a negative perception with current and prospective customers which could adversely affect our business

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  service revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by the addition of new deployed sites and greater penetration in existing markets  leading to a increase in the number of billing t equivalent lines during the previous months 
the average monthly revenue generated per billing site increased to  during the year ended december  from  for the same period of cost of service revenues excluding depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher site lease expense and fiber service provider charges incurred to support the billing sites that were added to the network during the past year 
partially offsetting this increase were the effects of the workforce reduction in the second quarter of discussed at note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of service revenue for the years ended december  and also included million and million  respectively  related to the impairment of long lived assets and other charges 
see note  impairment of long lived assets and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the following charges for the years ended december  and  we recorded an impairment charge of million and million  respectively  related to our assessment of the realizability of certain costs accumulated in construction in progress 
during the third quarter of  we suspended development activities in the carolina s market where we had not yet generated billing customers 
third party project management fees and construction costs related to these development activities  capitalized as construction in progress  had an aggregate net carrying value of million at september  and had no alternative use or salvage value 
the resultant long lived asset impairment charge of million is included in cost of service revenues for the year ended december  in connection with the suspension of development activities in this market  we paid contract termination costs and one time termination benefits totaling million 
cost of service revenues also includes million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  of long lived asset impairment charges related to the decommissioning of sites 
service revenues tend to lag behind cost of service revenues initially for new sites  especially in new markets  because there are certain upfront costs that are generally incurred for a period of time before a site generates revenue 
these costs include site evaluation expenses  lease payments that are incurred before the site generates revenues  payments to fiber service providers in order to ensure sufficient capacity is available to carry new traffic  as well as costs related to unsuccessful site acquisitions that are incurred during deployment 
due to the fact that most of our sites are relatively new  cost of service revenues excluding depreciation and amortization have historically exceeded service revenues 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease reflects the effects of the workforce reduction and a lower commission accrual in as compared to due to changes in our commission plan 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease  both at the field and corporate level  is primarily due to the effects of the workforce reduction  lower 
table of contents professional and consulting fees relating to public company related costs and lower facilities related expenses reflecting the termination or renegotiation of excess office space 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase reflects million in capital additions during driven by the addition of new deployed sites during the year 
during the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of million as a result of management s decision to restructure our operations to reflect changes in our strategic plan designed to reduce costs 
the resultant restructuring charge reflects i management s decision to cease market development activities in the carolina s market resulting in an exit plan for our site operating leases  ii termination benefits under a workforce reduction of employees consistent with our current network deployment plan and iii the consequent termination or renegotiation of excess office space including the former headquarters in new jersey 
see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as a result of the impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of of the carrying value of our fcc licenses  it was determined that the fair value of our fcc licenses was less than its carrying value 
consequently  the carrying value of our fcc licenses was reduced by million in the fourth quarter of to million at december  further impairment evaluations of our fcc licenses could lead to additional material impairment charges 
see note  impairment of fcc licenses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as a result of the impairment evaluation of the fair value of the carrying amount of goodwill in the first quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million reducing the fair value of goodwill to zero at march  as a result of such impairment evaluations in the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million during see note  impairment of goodwill  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the reduction was due to lower cash balances available for investment and lower interest rates 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of interest expense capitalized in in the first quarter of  we repurchased approximately million par value of our notes in the open market 
this early retirement of debt will result in a reduction of annualized interest expense of approximately million 
see note  subsequent event  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
miscellaneous income for included million for the decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the convertible notes 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million income tax benefit 
this income tax benefit was the result of reducing the deferred income tax liability associated with the fcc licenses for the tax impact of the million impairment charge on the fcc licenses

performance measures in managing our business and assessing our financial performance  we supplement the information provided by financial statement measures with several customer focused performance metrics to assess the growth and evaluate the performance of our operations 
in addition to traditional financial evaluations  including performance against budget  we also consider non financial measurements  the most important of which are revenue per billing site  the number of sites deployed  number of sites billing  the number of customer locations billing and total t equivalents billing 
the number of sites deployed represents sites from which we could deliver our services in a particular market 
customer locations billing are carrier locations  at which we currently provide revenue producing services 
a deployed site could have multiple customer carrier locations 
the number of sites billing represents the number of installed sites from which we provide revenue producing services to customers 
a t equivalent is a t or another increment of bandwidth that the company sells of approximately megabits per second 
this can be for either tdm or ethernet based backhaul 
revenue per billing site is a key operating metric reflecting our ability to scale and leverage our existing network 
the number of sites constructed is a key factor in determining the amount of additional capital expenditures required to grow the network and the number of field personnel required to support our operations and sales growth 
billing sites  the number of customer locations billing and the number of t equivalents per sites billing are all indicators of the productivity of the network

we have relied on the proceeds from equity and debt financings to provide cash for our operations 
on november   we completed the sale of million of convertible senior secured notes due on november  notes 
the notes were sold in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are fully guaranteed  jointly and severally  by us and each of our subsidiaries 
the notes contain certain anti dilution provisions that were triggered on november  resulting in a reduction of the conversion price 
see note  convertible senior secured notes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
our primary liquidity needs arise from capital requirements necessary to expand our network and fund operating losses 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million at december  we also require cash to service the interest on the notes described above 
upon closing the sale of the notes to the initial purchasers  we deposited into an escrow account million of the net proceeds from the notes offering  which  together with the proceeds from the investment thereof  were sufficient to make the first four semi annual interest payments on the notes in may and november of and thereafter  we have the option to pay interest on any or all of the next four semi annual interest payment dates in additional notes and the interest rate applicable to any such interest payments made in additional notes will be 
our board of directors has approved the payment of the may interest payment in additional notes 
our ability to pay our expenses and make full payments due on the notes depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  legislative and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest significantly in deploying our network over the next several years 
the size of our capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our 
table of contents ability to grow revenues  control costs  and deploy our network on a timely basis according to plan and customer requirements 
we will require significant cash expenditures related to capital construction costs and operating losses 
we anticipate that we will use between million and million of cash for capital expenditures during to expand our network 
however  if market conditions warrant  we are able to slow the amount of capital expenditures to a level consistent with the business needs at that time 
in the future  we intend to obtain financing through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  or both 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise sufficient funds  we may need to reduce our operations or delay our expansion 
in addition  we may be required to sell assets or incur additional debt  or we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity 
we may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
cash flow analysis our principal liquidity requirements are primarily for working capital purposes and the expansion of our network through our investment in network equipment and site acquisition and construction costs 
operating activities in  net cash used in operating activities increased by million to million compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the negative cash flow from operations in was primarily caused by a net loss of million and a reduction of accounts payable of million due to the payment of vendors  partially offset by non cash charges of million and an increase of million in accounts receivable

future liquidity and capital resource requirements based upon our current plans  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of million  will be sufficient to cover our estimated liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
we anticipate that we will use between million and million of cash for capital expenditures during to expand our network 
however  if market conditions warrant  we will be 
table of contents able to slow the amount of capital expenditures to a level consistent with the business needs at that time 
our long term economic model is designed to allow replicable  scalable individual market builds so that we can increase or decrease our market deployment schedule based on available cash 
as a result  the amount and timing of our long term capital needs will depend on the extent of our network deployment 
as our business is in its early stages  we regularly evaluate our plans and strategy  and these evaluations often result in changes  some of which may be material and significantly modify our cash requirements 
we have built flexibility into our spending  reducing capital expenditures  general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses 
however  our ability to pay our expenses and make full payments due on our notes  depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  legislative and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the overall weakness in the us economy may inhibit our ability to grow at the level needed to fully service our notes as scheduled 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased approximately million par value of our notes in the open market for approximately million 
we may from time to time  repurchase or retire additional amounts of outstanding notes 
see note  subsequent event  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
under the terms of our notes  if certain designated events occur prior to maturity  the holders of our notes may require us to repurchase all or part of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of their aggregate accreted principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
one of these designated events would be if our common stock is delisted from nasdaq and we are unable to relist our common stock on nasdaq or another national securities exchange within ninety days 
our common stock is currently trading below the minimum closing bid price of per share required by nasdaq for continued listing 
nasdaq has suspended this rule through april  however  if nasdaq does not extend the suspension of this rule or we are unable to increase our stock price through recapitalization or otherwise  or if we are unable to meet any other nasdaq continuing listing standards  our common stock could be delisted from nasdaq 
we may not have sufficient funds at such time to repurchase any or all of the notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
for additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates  see note  summary of significant accounting polices  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the application of these policies requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant judgments and estimates made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue and expense recognition we recognize revenues when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the services have been provided to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv the collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
amounts billed in advance of providing service are recorded as deferred revenues 
incremental direct costs of service activation are charged to expense as incurred 
we purchase electricity and lease co location site space from certain of our customers 
we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the amounts paid to our customers and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the purchased electricity and leased tower 
table of contents site space 
therefore  we charge such amounts to cost of service revenues as incurred 
other consideration provided to customers  such as customer incentives  is recorded as a reduction of service revenues 
accounts receivable allowances we encounter billing disputes with certain customers in the ordinary course of business 
we believe the impact of such disputes on our accounts receivable and service revenues is reasonably estimable based on historical experience 
accordingly  we maintain an allowance  through charges to service revenues  based on management s best estimate of the ultimate resolution of customer disputes 
we provided an allowance for billing disputes of a negligible amount as of december  and we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral or other credit enhancements 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and management s best estimate of future credit losses 
we provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of a negligible amount and million as of december  and  respectively 
useful life assignments and impairment evaluations associated with long lived assets  including intangible assets property and equipment  which consists principally of network equipment and capitalized site development costs  are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
depreciation is commenced when the assets are placed in service 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives 
the economic lives are estimated at the time assets are placed in service and are based on historical experience and anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods 
in assessing the recoverability of our property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized whenever i the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset  if any  are less than the carrying value of the asset and ii the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
when an impairment loss is identified  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value 
such impairment losses were identified in and see note  impairment of long lived assets and other charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as described more fully below  we evaluate our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  and between annual evaluations if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
in cases where required  an impairment provision is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of such assets 
such impairment losses were identified in the fourth quarter of related to the carrying value of our fcc licenses 
see note  impairment of fcc licenses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
such impairment losses were identified in and related to the carrying value of our goodwill  see note  impairment of goodwill  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
fcc licenses recoverability of the carrying value of fcc licenses is dependent on numerous factors  including successful deployment of networks and radio links or sales of such assets to a third party 
we consider the fcc licenses to have an indefinite useful life under the provisions of sfas  
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform an impairment test on these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired 
our licenses are integral to our business 
as a result  we believe that we must focus on protecting this valuable asset as our business plan evolves 
under fcc rules  wide area licenses in the ghz and ghz bands are renewed if the licensee files a renewal application at license expiration wherein the licensee demonstrates its engagement in supplying services or related activities to satisfy the fcc s substantial service criteria 
we will continue to lease spectrum  utilizing this non capital intensive method to put more of our fcc licenses to work 
we may also introduce new product offerings utilizing our spectrum 
under our current business plan  we believe that we will meet the fcc s substantial service requirements necessary for renewal at the appropriate deadlines and we will continue to engage the fcc on this subject 
if at any time we determine that we will most likely not meet these requirements  we will first test the fcc licenses for impairment and then we will modify the life of the particular fcc licenses and begin amortizing the cost over the remaining license period 
see note  guarantees and other contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fcc license renewal requirements and discussion of license renewals and extensions which occurred on october  we estimate the fair value of our fcc licenses using a discounted cash flow model 
cash flow projections and assumptions  although subject to a degree of uncertainty  are based on a combination of our historical performance and trends  our business plans and management s estimate of future performance  giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive economic conditions 
other assumptions include our weighted average cost of capital and long term rate of growth for our business 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use to estimate fair value 
an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related indefinite lived intangible asset and charged to results of operations 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record to an impairment charge associated with indefinite lived intangible assets 
although we do not expect our estimates or assumptions to change significantly in the future  the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our fcc licenses or using a methodology other than a discounted cash flow model could result in different values for our fcc licenses and may affect any related impairment charge 
the most significant assumptions within our discounted cash flow model are the discount rate  our projected growth rate  costs to build and operate the network and management s future business plans 
a change in management s future business plans or disposition of one or more fcc licenses could result in the requirement to test the fcc licenses for impairment 
if any legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors were to limit the useful lives of our indefinite lived fcc licenses  we would be required to test these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas and amortize the intangible asset over its remaining useful life 
for the fcc license impairment test performed as of november   it was determined that the fair value of the fcc licenses was less than its carrying value 
consequently  the carrying value of our fcc licenses was reduced by million in the fourth quarter of to million at december  further impairment evaluations of our fcc licenses could lead to additional material impairment charges 
see note  impairment of fcc licenses  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our fcc licenses had a carrying value of million at december   which was based on a valuation of first avenue s assets that was prepared in connection with the first avenue fibertower merger 
goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies is allocated to goodwill 
under the provisions of sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  we identified an indicator of 
table of contents impairment and thereby tested the fair value of our goodwill pursuant to the guidance in sfas this testing resulted in impairment charges totaling million in and million in against the recorded goodwill  reducing the fair value of goodwill to zero 
see note  impairment of goodwill  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have one reporting unit for consideration in the application of the impairment requirements of sfas when determining the fair value of this reporting unit  we considered both observed market equity values based on our publicly traded stock price and the income approach  which requires estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using an appropriate discount rate 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we recognize liabilities for asset retirement obligations relating to the estimated costs of removing network equipment from our leased co location sites  as stipulated in the related lease agreements 
the asset retirement obligations are recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of their fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years 
we calculate the net present value of the retirement obligation assuming a credit adjusted  risk free interest rate of 
we also assume the settlement date for removing the network equipment from our leased co location sites to be ten years from the date the asset is placed into service  which is the expected term of the related leases 
we monitor the estimates and assumptions used in determining our asset retirement obligations and adjust them accordingly if deemed necessary 
deferred taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally take into account all expected future events then known to us  other than changes in the tax law or rates  which are not permitted to be considered 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the amount of valuation allowance is based on our best estimate of the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning are considered in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  the necessity for and amount of the allowance is subject to adjustment in the future 
specifically  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the net deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
the valuation allowance does not alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss carryforwards in the future  the utilization of which is limited to achieving future taxable income 
at december   we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
leases we lease our facilities  including buildings  co location sites and certain fiber optic capacity  vehicles and equipment under leasing arrangements that have been accounted for as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
most of our operating lease arrangements represent agreements made with landlords for space leased at our co location sites 
the term of these agreements is typically for five years and we have the unilateral ability and intent to extend the term of these site lease agreements such that the minimum lease periods equal or slightly exceed the estimated ten year useful lives of the property and equipment located at such leased sites 
we also do not believe there are any explicit or implicit penalties  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  for failure to renew any site leases at the end of the respective assumed lease terms of approximately ten years that would extend the lease term past the assumed terms 
for leases that contain scheduled rent escalation provisions  we record the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight line basis over the lease term 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost related to employees and non employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant 
the determination of the estimated fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the option  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate our expected stock price volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock price as well as the historical volatilities of similar public companies in the telecommunications industry 
the expected term of the option is based on the guidance in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
we have not and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we determine the fair value of each restricted common stock award based on the fair value of our common stock at the date of award 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of award and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting award forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimated stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating expenses  net loss and net loss per share 
see note  stockholders equity and stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
related party transactions during the years ended december  and  we leased colocation space from certain stockholders that i own greater than of our outstanding equity securities and or ii have representatives who serve on our board of directors 
one of these related parties also provided us with certain services pertaining to its network operations center during such years 
the aggregate operating expenses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for years ended december   and  pertaining to these lease and service arrangements  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents an individual affiliated with an entity holding approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  serves on our board of directors 
a company controlled by a member of our board of directors periodically serves as a consultant to a holder of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  regarding its investments  including its holdings in the company 
the chairman of our board of directors serves as a director of tessco technologies incorporated 
tessco supplies us with various materials which are used in our business operations 
during  and  we paid tessco approximately million  million and million  respectively 
there was an additional million in unpaid and uninvoiced balances at december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million that were held in bank accounts and money market mutual funds which invest in us government securities 
at december   we had no investments with original maturities greater than three months 
we are adverse to principal loss and intend to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we intend to continue to invest our cash and cash equivalents in high quality money market funds that invest in securities with original maturities of less than three months 
as of december   we believe we have limited exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  because our investments have a maturity of less than three months 
we believe the fair value of the investment portfolio will not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the investment portfolio  although future interest income would be impacted by changes in interest rates as well as the amount of funds available to be invested in such securities 
our convertible senior secured notes  with a maturity of november  bear a fixed coupon rate of and a total interest yield of per annum 
the fair value of such notes is dependent upon a number of factors including future interest rates and the market value of fibertower s common stock 
the notes are traded in a very thinly traded resale market 
we do not hedge our debt obligations or engage in any derivative investments to offset the impact of future changes in the market value of the notes 
future increases in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the notes while decreases in rates would likely have the opposite effect 
at december   the estimated fair value and amortized cost of our notes were approximately million and million  respectively 
we have not held derivative financial or commodity instruments in the past and have no current plans to do so in the future 
we have not conducted business in foreign currencies in the past and have no current plans to do so in the future
