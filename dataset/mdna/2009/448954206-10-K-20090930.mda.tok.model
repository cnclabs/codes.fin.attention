in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein and the risks discussed below in item a 
risk factors  the following are important factors that  in the view of hyperdynamics  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements the availability of financing and  if available  on terms and conditions acceptable to us  our ability to raise sufficient capital and or enter into a strategic relationship with a industry partner to execute our business plan  ability to respond to changes in the oil exploration and production environment  competition  and the availability of personnel in the future to support our activities 
overview we devote substantially all of our efforts to raising funds to support our exploration and development of sub surface hydrocarbons in commercial quantities offshore guinea 
in april  we initiated the sale of our domestic us oil and gas operations  which consisted of working interests in several oil and gas properties in northeast louisiana  in which the sale was completed in its entirety in august we intend to continue acquiring  exploring and developing oil and gas properties on a global basis 
at this time we have no source of operating revenue and there is no assurance when we will  if ever 
we have limited cash and require substantial additional funds to fulfill our business plans 
in the short term we are seeking an industry partner to complete d and d seismic work in the contract area 
in the future  we intend to enter into a joint venture or other relationship with a strategic industry partner to fully execute our business plan including conducting exploratory drilling and production in the contract area 
our corporate mission is to provide energy for the future by exploring for  developing new  and re establishing pre existing sources of energy worldwide 
through our international business segment  we are currently exploring for oil and gas offshore guinea  west africa 
our operating plan within the next months includes the following completing the review and renegotiation of the psc with proper guinean authorities and resolving any differing positions regarding the terms of the psc with guinea 
obtaining financing for working capital and further d and d seismic work in the contract area 
entering into a joint venture or similar arrangement with an industry partner as a means of financing further seismic work in the contract area 
obtaining funds and entering into a joint venture or similar arrangement with an industry partner to drill offshore guinea 
we expect that entering into these partnering relationships would entail transferring a portion of our interest in the concession to such partner 
you should carefully consider the risks in evaluating our company 
the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form k are not the only ones we face and include  among others  that we may not continue as a going concern  we require substantial additional funding in the near term which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and if we cannot obtain additional  our ability to raise sufficient capital and or enter into a strategic relationship with a industry partner to execute our business plan  ability to respond to changes in the oil exploration and production environment  competition  and the availability of personnel in the future to support our activities may be curtailed and we may ultimately cease to exist  the pcs is subject to renegotiation and there is no assurance that these negotiations will result in a mutually acceptable agreement 
if these negotiations do not come to a satisfactory conclusion ie  through negotiations between us and guinea by march   the mou will be cancelled pursuant to its terms 
we operate in guinea  a country where corrupt behavior exists that could impair our ability to do business in the future or result in significant fines or penalties 
if the terms and conditions of the mou are not satisfied by march   and in the absence of an agreement between the parties  our retained portion of the contract area could be required to be relinquished to guinea 
however  in order to reach agreement  either party has the right to recourse to international arbitration  in which event both parties shall wait for the arbitration decision to be rendered 
there are significant risks associated with operating in guinea

risk factors 
sources of financing during the year ended june  on september   the company sold  convertible debentures  convertible at per share  to an investor in a registered direct offering 
placement costs totaled  with  payable in cash and  payable with  shares of the company s common stock  and the lender received  for legal costs 
this resulted in net cash proceeds of  the investor also received warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
on november   the company and the lender amended the agreement to reset the conversion price of the debenture to per share 
in addition  the exercise price of the may warrant was reduced to per share  the exercise price of the series a september warrant was reduced to per share  and the exercise price of the series b september warrant was reduced to per share 
we received proceeds of  from the sales of the assets of our domestic oil and gas assets 
we received the final  payment in august analysis of changes in financial position our current assets decreased  or  from  on june  to  on june  the most significant factor in the decrease is assets held for sale which decreased from  at june  to  at june  on april   we entered into a contract to sell our domestic working interest in the oil and gas properties located in louisiana 
these assets constituted our entire domestic business segment and were included in assets held for sale at june  the majority of the assets were sold during the fourth quarter of the sale was completed inaugust and these assets were removed from the books 
our long term assets increased  or  from  on june  to  on june  this increase was primarily the result of additional investments in unevaluated oil and gas properties in guinea in the amount of  our current liabilities decreased  or  from  on june  to  on june  the main factor in the decrease is accounts payable and accrued expenses  which decreased from  at june  to  at june  accounts payable at june  included amounts payable related primarily to the investments we had made in oil and gas properties  which totaled  and joint interest billing amounts due for lease operating expense of  these outstanding balances were paid during the quarter ended september  the decreases in accounts payable were partially offset by an increase in the variable share issuance obligation in the amount of  our long term liabilities decreased  from  as of june  to  as of june   due to a decrease in liabilities related to our domestic oil and gas assets held for sale and discontinued operations partially offset by an increase in long term debt due to the sale of  in convertible debentures in september results of operations 
based on the factors discussed below for our international segment  discontinued operations and for corporate overhead  the net loss attributable to common shareholders decreased  or  from a net loss of  or per share in to a net loss of  or per share in the net loss is comprised of the net loss from operations for our corporate office of  the net loss of scs of  and income from discontinued operations of  the net loss chargeable to common shareholders includes a provision for preferred stock dividends of  in and  in reportable segments hyperdynamics had two reportable segments our international operations in guinea scs and our domestic louisiana operations hydr 
scs is engaged in oil and gas exploration activities pertaining to offshore guinea  west africa 
hydr was engaged in oil and gas exploration and production activities in louisiana  united states 
during the year ended june   our domestic operations were discontinued  and as of august  all the assets associated with hydr have been sold 
hyperdynamics evaluates performance based on profit or loss from operations 
the reportable segments are managed by separate management teams who are evaluated based on their segment s performance 
results of operations domestic hydr comparison for fiscal year and discontinued operations generated income of  for the year ended june  and a loss of  for year ended june  this increase in the income was primarily due to the gain on the sale of assets held for sale in the amount of  results of operations international scs comparison for fiscal year and revenues 
there were no revenues for the years ended june  and we have focused on the acquisition and interpretation of seismic data for our concession in guinea 
depreciation 
depreciation increased  or  due to additional depreciation associated with assets placed in service at the beginning of fiscal depreciation expense was  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of  or  loss from operations 
based on the factors discussed above  our loss from operations from this segment decreased by  or  from  in the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  results of operations corporate overhead comparison for fiscal year and depreciation 
depreciation was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated during the year 
settlement expense 
settlement expense for the years ended june  and  respectively  was and  we accrued a settlement agreement in based on developments in the dixon case  as discussed in item legal proceedings and in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a repricing of warrants that had previously been issued in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit in resulted in additional settlement expense of  during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  to  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease was a decrease in stock compensation expense from fiscal year ended june  to june  of approximately  a decrease in reporting expenses of  and the settlement expense of  that was expensed in the fiscal year ended june  that was not present in the fiscal year ended june  interest expense  net interest expense was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of  or  attributable to a convertible note payable and debenture that were entered into during fiscal year liquidity and capital resources going concern considerations the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on the financial statements for the year ended june  includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million for the period from inception to june  as of june   we had cash on hand of million  short term debt of million and we have a working capital deficit of approximately million 
we require significant additional funding to sustain our current operations 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding in order to finance our planned operations 
we have historically been able to raise capital from debt or equity sources to finance our activities 
the world economic crisis  the depressed price for oil  and the depressed price of our stock have weakened our ability to continue to raise new capital in this manner 
capital may not be available on the terms and conditions acceptable to us or at all 
these combined conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
hyperdynamics plan to resolve the uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern includes the sale of our producing oil and gas properties in louisiana  cost reductions  and monetization of our oil and gas exploration assets by attracting a joint venture or financial partner to participate in our exploration of our oil and gas concession offshore guinea 
we expect that entering into these partnering relationships would entail transferring a portion of our interest in the concession to such partner 
on april   we executed a contract to sell our domestic oil and gas assets  which for accounting purposes is treated as three separate sales 
under the terms of the agreement  the buyer has already paid the full  aggregate cash amount of  in for the properties 
two of the sales transactions closed in the fourth quarter of the year ended june   and the third sale closed in august management s plans focus primarily on obtaining well capitalized joint venture partners to help us monetize a portion of our concession 
management is also evaluating how it can raise additional capital to further its business operations 
if management is not successful in securing outside funding by monetizing a portion of its exploration assets or in raising additional funds  we may cease operations 
our top corporate priority at this time is to attract a joint venture or financial partner so that we can fund an accelerated exploration work program offshore guinea 
we now expect these major funds to come primarily from selling working interests to financial partners or joint venture partners that invest in our contract area 
it is expected that our near term estimated costs for future exploration and analysis will be approximately million 
liquidity based on the company s current plans and market conditions  management does not believe that the company s existing cash and current operations will be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
the company requires additional working capital and has adequate capital resources to meet current working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the second quarter of fiscal year however  future financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may be forced to curtail operations or may ultimately cease to exist 
on june   the company had  in cash and  in liabilities 
the liabilities include current liabilities of  and noncurrent liabilities of  net cash used in operating activities for continuing operations for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  cash used by investing activities for continuing operations during the year ended june  was  compared to  used by investing activities in net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was  from the proceeds of issuing convertible debentures offset by payments on notes payable and installment debt 
net cash of  was provided by financing activities during the year ended june  our current ratio was at june  and at june  current liabilities as of june  contain several items that are payable in stock  that are the subject of deferred payment arrangements whereby the vendor will not get paid except out of future revenues or cash received from a joint venture partner  or that will be assumed by others 
variable share issuance obligation of  dividends payable of  and dividends payable to related party of  are payable in stock 
accounts payable seismic data of  is payable only when we sell the data to third parties or if we get cash infusion for the guinea concession 
additionally   is accrued in accounts payable to a vendor who  by the terms of his agreement  will not be paid until we obtain funding from a financial or joint venture partner for guinea 
this amounts to approximately  of the  reflected in current liabilities which will not result in a cash outflow  will not be paid until we have adequate funds to pay them  or will be assumed by another party 
if we considered the effect of these liabilities  our current ratio would be to at june  liquidity effects of discontinued operations on april   we executed a contract to sell all of our working interests in our us domestic oil and gas properties for  the third and final installment under the agreement was completed in august the cash flows from discontinued operations are separately reported in the audited consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented 
while this transaction improved our short term liquidity  it also eliminated our sole revenue source 
accordingly  the liquidity implication of the discontinued operations is that we will require additional funding from debt or equity sources or from a joint venture or financial partner in our guinea concession in order to continue operations 
we expect that entering into these partnering relationships would entail transferring a portion of our interest in the concession to such partner 
critical accounting policies we account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the sec 
accordingly  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of proved oil and natural gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and annual lease rentals are capitalized 
all general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred 
sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change 
depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  net of tax considerations 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin topic dc  we utilize the prices in effect on a date subsequent to the end of a reporting period in which the full cost ceiling limitation was exceeded at the end of a reporting period 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs excluded costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination as to the existence of proved reserves 
we review our unevaluated properties at the end of each quarter to determine whether the costs incurred should be transferred to the full cost pool and thereby subject to amortization 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
we assess our unevaluated properties on a country by country basis 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
however  if proved reserves have not yet been established in a full cost pool  these costs are charged against earnings in the respective country 
for these international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  surrendering drilling rights or other information 
ceiling test the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule under full cost accounting rules for each cost center  capitalized costs of proved properties  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  shall not exceed an amount the cost ceiling equal to the sum of a the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  discounted at percent  plus b the cost of properties not being amortized  plus c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  less d any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged as an impairment expense 
as of june   we had no oil and gas properties subject to the ceiling test 
impairment at june    we had  of capitalized costs associated with our guinea operations 
based on an impairment analysis performed by management and the completion of work requirements under the psc and mou  no impairment of these assets was indicated as of june  environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change our estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from our estimates 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations represent our best estimate of the fair value of our future abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties  including the costs of removal and disposition of tangible equipment  site and environmental restoration 
we estimate the fair value of our retirement costs in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
the determination of the fair value of an asset retirement obligation generally involves estimating the fair value of the obligation at the end of the property s useful life and then discounting it to present value using our credit adjusted  risk free rate of return 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding the expected removal and site restoration costs  timing and present value discount rates 
changes in the estimated useful life and the fair value of the asset retirement obligation are imprecise since the removal activities will generally occur several years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental and safety considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligations 
fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  eg  the black scholes valuation model using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms 
share based compensation effective july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which was issued in december  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments in the financial statements over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award presumptively the vesting period 
sfas no 
r also requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we account for non employee share based awards in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquisition  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
contingent obligations we have a contingent  note payable that is only payable with of the profits of scs corporation 
we have the right to pay this note off using common stock
