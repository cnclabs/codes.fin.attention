introduction and overview we are a national provider of comprehensive hvac installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services within the mechanical services industry 
the services we provide address a very broad need  as air is circulated through almost all commercial  industrial and institutional buildings virtually year round 
we operate primarily in the commercial  industrial and institutional hvac markets and perform most of our services within office buildings  retail centers  apartment complexes  manufacturing plants  and healthcare  education and government facilities 
in addition to standard hvac services  we provide specialized applications such as building automation control systems  fire protection  process cooling  electronic monitoring and process piping 
certain locations also perform related activities such as electrical service and plumbing 
nature and economics of our business approximately of our revenues are earned on a project basis for installation of hvac systems in newly constructed facilities or for replacement of hvac systems in existing facilities 
customers hire us to ensure such systems deliver specified or generally expected heating  cooling  conditioning and circulation of air in a facility 
this entails installing core system equipment such as packaged heating and air conditioning units  or in the case of larger facilities  separate core components such as chillers  boilers  air handlers  and cooling towers 
we also typically install connecting and distribution elements such as piping and ducting 
our responsibilities usually require conforming the systems to pre established engineering drawings and equipment and performance specifications  which we frequently participate in establishing 
our project management responsibilities include staging equipment and materials to project sites  deploying labor to perform the work  and coordinating with other service providers on the project  including any subcontractors we might use to deliver our portion of the work 
when competing for project business  we usually estimate the costs we will incur on a project  and then propose a bid to the customer that includes a contract price and other performance and payment terms 
our bid price and terms are intended to cover our estimated costs on the project and provide a profit margin to us commensurate with the value of the installed system to the customer  the risk that project costs or duration will vary from estimate  the schedule on which we will be paid  the opportunities for other work that we might forego by committing capacity to this project  and other costs that we incur more broadly to support our operations but which are not specific to the project 
typically customers will seek bids from competitors for a given project 
while the criteria on which customers select the winning bid vary widely and include factors such as quality  technical expertise  on time performance  post project support and service  and company history and financial strength  we believe that price is the most influential factor for most customers in choosing an hvac installation and service provider 
after a customer accepts our bid  we generally enter into a contract with the customer that specifies what we will deliver on the project  what our related responsibilities are  and how much and when we will be paid 
our overall price for the project is typically set at a fixed amount in the contract  although changes in project specifications or work conditions that result in unexpected additional work are usually subject to additional payment from the customer via what are commonly known as change orders 
project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project 
project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a 
table of contents small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
labor and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service 
accordingly  labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance 
given the fixed price nature of much of our project work  if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders  we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work 
we also perform some project work on a cost plus or a time and materials basis  under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit margin 
these margins are typically less than fixed price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost plus or time and materials work 
as of december   we had  projects in process 
our average project takes six to nine months to complete  with an average contract price of approximately  our projects generally require working capital funding of equipment and labor costs 
customer payments on periodic billings generally do not recover these costs until late in the job 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms as discussed above generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
we have what we believe is a well diversified distribution of revenues across end use sectors that we believe reduces our exposure to negative developments in any given sector 
because of the integral nature of hvac and related controls systems to most buildings  we have the legal right in almost all cases to attach liens to buildings or related funding sources when we have not been fully paid for installing systems  except with respect to some government buildings 
the service work that we do  which is discussed further below  usually does not give rise to lien rights 
we also perform larger hvac projects 
as of december   we had projects in process with a contract price of between and million  projects between million and million  projects between million and million  and projects between million and million 
taken together  projects with contract prices of million or more totaled  million of aggregate contract value as of december   or approximately  out of a total contract value for all projects in progress of  million 
generally  projects closer in size to million will be completed in one year or less 
it is unusual for us to work on a project that exceeds two years in length 
in addition to project work  approximately of our revenues represent maintenance and repair service on already installed hvac and controls systems 
this kind of work usually takes from a few hours to a few days to perform 
prices to the customer are usually based on the equipment and materials used in the service as well as technician labor time 
we usually bill the customer for service work when it is complete  typically with payment terms of up to thirty days 
we also provide maintenance and repair service under ongoing contracts 
under these contracts  we are paid regular monthly or quarterly amounts and provide specified service based on customer requirements 
these agreements typically cover periods ranging from one to three years and are cancelable on to days notice 
a relatively small but growing portion of our revenues comes from national and regional account customers 
these customers typically have multiple sites  and contract with us to perform maintenance and repair service 
these contracts may also provide for us to perform new or replacement systems installation 
we operate a national call center to dispatch technicians to sites requiring service 
we perform the majority of this work with our own employees  with the balance being subcontracted to third parties that meet our performance qualifications 
we will also typically use proprietary information systems to maintain information on the customer s sites and equipment  including performance and service records  and related cost data 
these systems track the status of ongoing 
table of contents service and installation work  and may also monitor system performance data 
under these contractual relationships  we usually provide consolidated billing and credit payment terms to the customer 
profile and management of our operations we manage our operating units based on a variety of factors 
financial measures we emphasize include profitability  and use of capital as indicated by cash flow and by other measures of working capital principally involving project cost  billings and receivables 
we also monitor selling  general  administrative and indirect project support expense  backlog  workforce size and mix  growth in revenues and profits  variation of actual project cost from original estimate  and overall financial performance in comparison to budget and updated forecasts 
operational factors we emphasize include project selection  estimating  pricing  management and execution practices  labor utilization  safety  training  and the make up of both existing backlog as well as new business being pursued  in terms of project size  technical application and facility type  end use customers and industries  and location of the work 
most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis 
attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business  particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation  the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants such as architects and consulting engineers  and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets 
accordingly  we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality  stability  and contingency planning  including related considerations of compensation  and non competition protection where applicable 
economic and industry factors as an hvac and building controls services provider  we operate in the broader nonresidential construction services industry and are affected by trends in this sector 
while we do not have operations in all major cities of the united states  we believe our national presence is sufficiently large that we experience trends in demand for and pricing of our services that are consistent with trends in the national nonresidential construction sector 
as a result  we monitor the views of major construction sector forecasters along with macroeconomic factors they believe drive the sector  including trends in gross domestic product  interest rates  business investment  employment  demographics  and the general fiscal condition of federal  state and local governments 
although nonresidential construction activity has demonstrated periods of both significant growth and decline  it has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately over the last twenty five years 
spending decisions for building construction  renovation and system replacement are generally made on a project basis  usually with some degree of discretion as to when and if projects proceed 
with larger amounts of capital  time  and discretion involved  spending decisions are affected to a significant degree by uncertainty  particularly concerns about economic and financial conditions and trends 
we have experienced periods of time when economic weakness caused a significant slowdown in decisions to proceed with installation and replacement project work 
operating environment and management emphasis nonresidential building construction and renovation activity  as reported by the federal government  declined over the three year period of to and has expanded moderately during and  and was strong during through during the decline and through  we responded to market challenges by pursuing work in sectors less affected by this downturn  such as government  educational  and health care facilities  and by establishing marketing initiatives that take advantage of our size and range of expertise 
we also responded to declining gross profits over those years by reducing our selling  general  and administrative expenses  and our indirect project and service 
table of contents overhead costs 
we believe our efforts in these areas partially offset the decline in our profitability over that period 
we have experienced notable improvements in both industry activity as well as our own results since  as discussed further under results of operations below 
as a result of our sale of certain assets and our continued strong emphasis on cash flow  our debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility is now zero  and we have substantial uncommitted cash balances  as discussed further in liquidity and capital resources below 
on february   we put a new credit facility in place with considerably less restrictive terms than those of our previous facilities 
in addition  we have a second surety to further support our bonding needs  and we believe our relationships with the surety markets are positive in light of our strong current results and financial position 
we have generated positive free cash flow in each of the last ten calendar years and will continue our emphasis in this area 
we believe that the relative size and strength of our balance sheet and surety support as compared to most companies in our industry represent competitive advantages for us 
as discussed at greater length in results of operations below  we have seen increased activity levels in our industry since until the present 
we expect price competition to continue to be strong  as local and regional competitors respond cautiously to changing conditions 
we will continue our efforts to find the more active sectors in our markets  and to increase our regional and national account business 
our primary emphasis for will be on execution and cost control  rather than on growth 
we plan to continue our involvement in multi family work  however  we have decided to focus a portion of our resources away from this work and we expect that as a result  the portion of our work that is multi family will diminish somewhat in the future 
in addition to the work we have done on our underperforming units  we have increased our focus on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
critical accounting policies in response to the commission s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified our critical accounting policies based upon the significance of the accounting policy to our overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and our use of estimates and subjective assessments 
we have concluded that our most critical accounting policy is our revenue recognition policy 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our business has two service functions i installation  which we account for under the percentage of completion method  and ii maintenance  repair and replacement  which we account for as the services are performed  or in the case of replacement  under the percentage of completion method 
in addition  we identified other critical accounting policies related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities  valuation of deferred tax assets and the recoverability of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
percentage of completion method of accounting approximately of our revenues were earned on a project basis and recognized through the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method as provided by american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  contract revenue recognizable at any time during the life of a contract is determined by multiplying expected total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any time to total estimated contract costs 
more specifically  as part of the negotiation and bidding process in which we engage in connection with obtaining installation contracts  we estimate our contract costs  which include all direct materials exclusive of rebates  labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance  such as 
table of contents indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
these contract costs are included in our results of operations under the caption cost of services 
then  as we perform under those contracts  we measure such costs incurred  compare them to total estimated costs to complete the contract  and recognize a corresponding proportion of contract revenue 
labor costs are considered to be incurred as the work is performed 
subcontract labor is recognized as the work is performed  but is generally subjected to approval as to milestones or other evidence of completion 
non labor project cost consists of purchased equipment  prefabricated materials and other materials 
purchased equipment on our projects is substantially produced to job specifications and is a value added element to our work 
the costs are considered to be incurred when title is transferred to us  which typically is upon delivery to the worksite 
prefabricated materials  such as ductwork and piping  are generally performed at our shops and recognized as contract costs when fabricated for the unique specifications of the job 
other materials cost are not significant and are generally recorded when delivered to the worksite 
this measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract  and these updates may include subjective assessments 
our contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on reaching agreed upon milestones or as we incur costs 
the schedules for such billings usually do not precisely match the schedule on which we incur costs 
as a result  contract revenues recognized in the statement of operations can and usually do differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract 
amounts by which cumulative contract revenues recognized on a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative billings to the customer under the contract are reflected as a current asset in our balance sheet under the caption costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
amounts by which cumulative billings to the customer under a contract as of a given date exceed cumulative contract revenues recognized on the contract are reflected as a current liability in our balance sheet under the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance  job conditions  and final contract settlements 
these factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and  therefore  revenues 
such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments 
we recognize these revisions in the period in which they are determined 
if such revisions lead us to conclude that we will recognize a loss on a contract  the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period we reach that conclusion  regardless of the percentage of completion of the contract 
revisions to project costs and conditions can give rise to change orders under which the customer agrees to pay additional contract price 
revisions can also result in claims we might make against the customer to recover project variances that have not been satisfactorily addressed through change orders with the customer 
except in certain circumstances  we do not recognize revenues or margin based on change orders or claims until they have been agreed upon with the customer 
the amount of revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims is currently immaterial 
variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results  depending on project size  and the recoverability of the variation via additional customer payments 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivable amounts we believe we will not ultimately collect 
this requires us to make certain judgments and estimates involving  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  our prior collection history with the customer  ongoing relationships with the customer  the aging of past due balances  our lien rights  if any  in the property where we performed the work  and the availability  if any  of payment bonds applicable to our contract 
these estimates are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 

table of contents accounting for self insurance liabilities we are substantially self insured for worker s compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages 
loss estimates associated with the larger and longer developing risks worker s compensation  auto liability and general liability are reviewed by a third party actuary quarterly 
we believe these accruals are adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences  ongoing treatment or loss mitigation  general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that such experience becomes known 
accounting for deferred tax assets we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation quarterly 
estimations of required valuation allowances include estimates of future taxable income 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets becomes deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent we have estimated 
recoverability of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill is the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles  statement we do not amortize goodwill 
statement requires us to assess our goodwill asset amounts for impairment each year  and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred 
impairment must be reflected when the value of a given business unit in excess of its tangible net assets falls below the goodwill asset balance carried for that unit on our books 
if other business units have had increases in the value of their respective goodwill balances  such increases may not be recorded under statement accordingly  such increases may not be netted against impairments at other business units 
the requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
this information  and its use in assessing goodwill  entails some degree of subjective assessment 
we currently perform our annual impairment testing as of october and any impairment charges resulting from this process are reported in the fourth quarter 
we segregate our operations into reporting units based on the degree of operating and financial independence of each unit and our related management of them 
these reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model combined with market valuation approaches 
significant estimates and assumptions are used in assessing the fair value of reporting units 
these estimates and assumptions involved future cash flows  growth rates  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market valuations for each of the reporting units 
we incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual  fourth quarter goodwill impairment tests in   or additionally  we did not encounter any events or changes in circumstances that indicated that an impairment was more likely than not during interim periods in 
table of contents   or however  there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future 
statement also requires that identifiable intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their useful lives 
changes in strategy and or market condition  may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  revenues cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses gain loss on sale of assets operating income interest income  net other income income before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations operating loss  net of tax estimated gain on disposition  including tax net income compared to revenues increased million  or to  million in compared to approximately of the increase in revenues related to internal growth and the remaining resulted from acquisitions 
the internal revenue growth stemmed primarily from increased activity in the nonresidential markets throughout the united states especially in government approximately million  education approximately million and healthcare facilities approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by decreased activity in the multi family sector approximately million 
we have seen increased activity  primarily at our central florida  central arizona and wisconsin operations  resulting from the start up of several large projects partially offset by our planned downsizing of our large multi family operations based in texas and lower activity levels at our california operation 
backlog reflects revenues still to be recognized under contracted or committed installation and replacement project work 
project work generally lasts less than one year 
service agreement revenues and service work and short duration projects which are generally billed as performed do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenues for any given future period  and it represents revenues that are likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 

table of contents backlog as of december  was million a decrease from september  backlog of million 
the sequential decrease was primarily due to the planned decrease at our large multi family operation based in texas  as well as decreases at our virginia  tennessee  and central arizona operations 
on a same store basis  backlog as of december  was million  a decrease of from december  backlog of million 
the year over year decrease is primarily due to planned decrease at our large multi family operation based in texas  as well as decreases at our central arizona and central florida locations 
following the three year period of industry activity declines from noted previously  we saw year over year revenue increases at our ongoing operations beginning in mid and continuing throughout based on our backlog and forecasts from industry construction analysts  we expect that activity levels in our industry are likely to decrease in  particularly in the area of new construction 
during we placed a greater emphasis on internal execution and margin improvement than on revenue growth 
this included a strong focus on those of our units that have underperformed  along with increased training efforts on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
these efforts helped us increase gross profit in we continue to experience a noticeable amount of price competition in our markets  which restrains our ability to increase revenues 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in as compared to approximately of the increase is due to internal growth and the remaining is due to acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit for was  up from in the increase in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from improved results at our large multi family operation based in texas approximately million  as well as from improved profitability at our central florida operation approximately million  and at our southern maryland operation approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by lower margins at our combined arizona operations approximately million and central washington operation approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased million  or for as compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a increased from in to for this is primarily due to higher compensation accruals due to strong performance at a number of our operations  an increase in the number of selling and overhead personnel for new or expanded service operations  the acquisition and start up of new operations and increased bad debt expense 
interest income  net interest income  net was million in and million in the net decrease is primarily due to the interest expense associated with notes due to former owners of acquired companies 
income tax expense our year to date effective tax rate for was  as compared to in adjustments to tax reserves are analyzed and adjusted quarterly as events occur to warrant such changes 
adjustments to tax reserves are a component of the effective tax rate

the sequential decrease is primarily from our tennessee  maryland  alabama operations as well as our texas based multi family operation 
approximately of the year over year increase in backlog is primarily from our alabama  colorado  wisconsin and southern california operations  and the remaining resulted from acquisitions 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  historical gross profit for was  up from in the increase in gross profit resulted primarily from broad based improvements in profitability from higher margin projects in a number of our markets as well as improved profitability at our wisconsin operation approximately million  california operation approximately million and strong job performance at our alabama and northern georgia operations approximately million 
the increase was partially offset by continued underperformance at our large multi family operation based in texas approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased million  or for as compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a increased from in to in this is primarily due to higher compensation accruals due to strong performance at a number of our operations  and increase in the number of selling and overhead personnel for new or expanded service operations and the acquisition and start up of new operations 
interest income  net interest income  net was million in and million in the increase in interest income is due to interest income earned from higher cash balances in see liquidity and capital resources for a detail of the components of interest income  net for and income tax expense our effective tax rate associated with results from continuing operations for was  as compared to in historically  our effective tax rate was generally higher than statutory federal and state rates because of the effect of certain expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes 
however  in  the increase in the deduction for certain of our construction related activities and our tax exempt interest income has allowed our effective tax rate to be lower than statutory rates 
adjustments to tax reserves are analyzed and adjusted quarterly as events occur to warrant such changes 
adjustments to tax reserves are a component of the effective tax rate 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the production activity deduction from in to in and a change in expected tax expense in a certain jurisdiction 
discontinued operations sale of assets to mesa energy systems  inc on june   we  along with our wholly owned subsidiary  arc comfort systems usa  inc arc  entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell certain assets of arc to mesa energy systems  inc a subsidiary of emcor group  inc for approximately million in cash 
these assets were sold at book value 
the after tax loss of this company of million for  has been reported in discontinued operations under operating loss  net of income tax benefit 
sale of companies to alc on december   we sold two operations to automated logic corporation and automated logic contracting services  inc together  alc for approximately million in cash  net of transaction costs and a purchase price adjustment based upon the closing balance sheet for the transferred assets 
the receivable related to this sale was paid during the first 
table of contents quarter of we paid million in taxes related to this transaction during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional gain of million  net of tax  related to the collection of certain receivables 
this gain has been reported in discontinued operations under estimated gain on disposition  including income tax benefit 
outlook we expect that developing weakness in the underlying environment for non residential activity will affect activity levels in our industry compared to our backlog continues to be at solid levels but has been declining 
our primary emphasis for will be on execution including a focus on cost controls and efficient project and service performance at the unit level 
based on our backlog and the weakening economic conditions for our industry over the coming year  we expect continued profitability in but expect lower profitability than we achieved in liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities free cash flow cash provided by operating activities taxes paid related to the sale of businesses purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities excluding items related to sales of businesses  less customary capital expenditures  plus the proceeds from asset sales 
positive free cash flow represents funds available to invest in significant operating initiatives  to acquire other companies  or to reduce a company s outstanding debt or equity 
if free cash flow is negative  additional debt or equity is generally required to fund the outflow of cash 
free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies 
our business does not require significant amounts of investment in long term fixed assets 
the substantial majority of the capital used in our business is working capital that funds our costs of labor and installed equipment deployed in project work until our customers pay us 
customary terms in our industry allow customers to withhold a small portion of the contract price until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
accordingly  we believe free cash flow  by encompassing both profit margins and the use of working capital over our approximately one year working capital cycle  is an effective measure of operating effectiveness and efficiency 
we have included free cash flow information here for this reason  and because we are often asked about it by third parties evaluating us 
however  free cash flow is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results  and accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income  net income  or amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents for the year ended december   we had free cash flow of million as compared to million in this decrease resulted primarily from an investment in working capital due to higher activity levels 
for the year ended december   we had free cash flow of million as compared to million in this increase is a result of higher profitability and significant working capital efficiency primarily due to lower revenue growth in as compared to primarily in our multi family operations 
during  we collected approximately million  primarily related to the sale of two operations to automated logic corporation and automated logic contracting services  inc of million and million related to the sale of arc to mesa energy systems  inc on march   our board of directors the board approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to one million shares of our outstanding common stock 
the board approved extensions of the program to cover an additional  shares on november    shares on february    shares on august   and  shares on november  we repurchased million shares for approximately million and million shares for approximately million under our share repurchase program for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this share repurchase is reflected as a financing outflow in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
credit facility on february   we entered into a million senior credit facility the facility provided by a syndicate of banks 
the facility is available for borrowings and letters of credit and will expire in february the facility is secured by the capital stock of our current and future subsidiaries 
as of december   the total of the facility was million  with no outstanding borrowings  million in letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit available 
we have a choice of two interest rate options for borrowings under the facility  these rates are floating rates determined by the broad financial markets  meaning they can and do move up and down from time to time 
excluding the amortization of debt financing and arrangement costs  we estimate that the interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the facility would be approximately as of december  we incurred approximately million in financing and professional costs in connection with the arrangement of the original facility and the current facility 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis as a non cash charge to interest expense over the term of the facility in an amount of approximately million per year 
commitment fees are payable on the portion of the capacity not in use for borrowings or letters of credit at any given time 
these fees range from per annum  based on the ratio of debt to credit facility adjusted ebitda 
interest expense included the following primary elements in thousands year ended december  interest expense on borrowings  and unused commitment fees letter of credit fees amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs total covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarter end 
we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants as of december  credit facility adjusted ebitda is defined under the facility for financial covenant purposes as net earnings for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date  plus the corresponding amounts for a interest 
table of contents expense  b income taxes  c depreciation and amortization  and d other non cash charges 
the following is a reconciliation of credit facility adjusted ebitda to net income in thousands net income income taxes interest income  net depreciation and amortization expense credit facility adjusted ebitda the facility s principal financial covenants include leverage ratio the facility requires that the ratio of our total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents to our credit facility adjusted ebitda not exceed 
fixed charge coverage ratio the facility requires that the ratio of credit facility adjusted ebitda  less non financed capital expenditures  tax provision  dividends and amounts used to repurchase stock to the sum of interest expense and scheduled principal payments be at least 
capital expenditures  tax provision  dividends and stock repurchase payments are defined under the facility for purposes of this covenant to be amounts for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date 
the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio excludes acquisitions  stock repurchases and the payment of cash dividends at any time that the leverage ratio does not exceed other restrictions the facility permits acquisitions of up to million per transaction  or million in the aggregate 
however  these limitations only apply when the leverage ratio is greater than notes to former owners we issued subordinated notes to the former owners of acquired companies  as part of the consideration used to acquire these companies 
these notes had an outstanding balance of million  of which million is current  as of december  and bear interest  payable annually  at a weighted average interest rate of 
off balance sheet arrangements and other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our most significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases 
we also have other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
we have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
the letters of credit we provide are actually issued by our lenders through the facility as described above 
a letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the lenders 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
absent a claim  there is no payment or reserving of funds by us in connection with a letter of credit 
however  because a claim on a letter of credit would require 
table of contents immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders  letters of credit are treated as a use of the facility s capacity just the same as actual borrowings 
claims against letters of credit are rare in our industry 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by a lender or by us 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
if we fail to perform under the terms of a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods or services under a contract  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the sureties for any expenses or outlays they incur 
to date  we are not aware of any losses to our sureties in connection with bonds the sureties have posted on our behalf  and we do not expect such losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future 
surety market conditions are currently challenging as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately to of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our primary surety and we have added another surety to further support our bonding needs  current market conditions as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our sureties to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
we would likely also encounter concerns from customers  suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness 
while we believe our general operating and financial characteristics  including a significant amount of cash on our balance sheet  would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  such an interruption would likely cause our revenues and profits to decline in the near term 
the following recaps the future maturities of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands twelve months ended december  thereafter total notes to former owners interest payable operating lease obligations absent any significant commitments of capital for items such as capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases  it is reasonable to expect us to continue to maintain excess cash on our balance sheet 
therefore  we assumed that we would continue our current status of not utilizing any borrowings under our revolving loan 
as of december  we also have million letter of credit commitments  all of which expire in the substantial majority of these letters of credit are posted with insurers who disburse funds on our behalf in connection with our worker s compensation  auto liability and general liability insurance program 
these letters of credit provide additional security to the insurers that sufficient financial resources will be available to fund claims on our behalf  many of which develop over long periods of time  should we ever encounter financial duress 
posting of letters of credit for this purpose is a common practice for entities that manage their self insurance programs through third party insurers as we do 
while all of these letter of credit commitments expire in  we expect nearly all of them  particularly those supporting our insurance programs  will be renewed annually 

table of contents other than the operating lease obligations noted above  we have no significant purchase or operating commitments outside of commitments to deliver equipment and provide labor in the ordinary course of performing project work 
outlook we have generated positive net free cash flow for the last ten calendar years  much of which occurred during challenging economic and industry conditions 
we also expect to have borrowing capacity under our credit facility and we continue to have uncommitted cash balances 
we believe these factors will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
in addition  fin requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
we adopted fin on january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements statement  effective for fiscal years beginning after november  statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the statement does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp that amends statement to delay the effective date for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
fsp defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted statement on january  for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis 
there was no impact upon adoption of statement to the consolidated financial statements  however  we were required to provide additional disclosure regarding marketable securities 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement r revised  business combinations  statement r which establishes principles for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in the financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
this statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
statement r is effective for us beginning january  the portions of the statement that relate to business combinations completed before the effective date will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  our adoption of statement r will significantly impact our accounting and reporting for future acquisitions  principally as a result of i expanded requirements to value acquired assets  liabilities and contingencies at their fair values  and ii the requirement that acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a part of the cost of the acquisition 
in june  the fasb issued fsp emerging issues task force eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  whether paid or unpaid  are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of both basic and diluted earnings per share 
this fsp will be effective beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this fsp will have on the financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
we are actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant financial market risks including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we have limited exposure to changes in interest rates under our revolving credit facility 
we have a debt facility under which we may borrow funds in the future 
we do not currently foresee any borrowing needs 
our debt with fixed interest rates consists of notes to former owners of acquired companies 
the following table presents principal amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  twelve months ended december  fair value thereafter fixed rate debt average interest rate as of december   our marketable securities consisted of million of auction rate securities  which are variable rate debt instruments  having long term maturities  but whose interest rates are designed to reset through an auction process  at intervals ranging from seven to days 
we had no investments in marketable securities as of december  all of our auction rate securities are high quality direct municipal obligations which have high investment grade ratings or otherwise are backed by high investment grade rated insurance agencies as of december  in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets caused auctions representing some of the auction rate securities we hold to fail because the amount of securities offered for sale exceeded the bids 
as a result  the liquidity of our remaining auction rate securities has diminished  and we expect that this decreased liquidity for our auction rate securities will continue as long as the present depressed global credit market environment persists  or until issuers refinance and replace these securities with other instruments 
as a result of the temporary declines in fair value for our auction rate securities  which we attribute to liquidity issues rather than credit issues  we recorded an unrealized loss of million  net of tax  to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our analysis of the fair values of these securities considered  among other items  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the timing of expected future cash flows  and the possibility that a discount may be required if we choose to sell the securities in the absence of a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics 
as a result of the current situation in the auction markets  our ability to liquidate our investment in auction rate securities and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or impossible 
if in the future the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate and if we determine that any future valuation adjustment was other than temporary  we may be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
because the tax exempt interest rates on these bonds are relatively attractive  we expect that we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss in the foreseeable future  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to october to be repaid 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan
