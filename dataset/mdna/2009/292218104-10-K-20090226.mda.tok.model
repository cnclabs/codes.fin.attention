we refer to such decreases as favorable developments 
the reductions in reserves were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
estimates of net incurred losses and lae are established by management utilizing actuarial indications based upon our historical and industry experience regarding claim emergence and claim payment patterns  and regarding claim cost trends  adjusted for future anticipated changes in claims related and economic trends  as well as regulatory and legislative changes  to establish our best estimate of the losses and lae reserves 
the decrease in the prior year reserves was primarily the result of actual paid losses being less than expected  and revised assumptions used in the projection of future losses and lae payments based on more current information about the impact of certain changes  such as legislative changes  which was not available at the time the reserves were originally established 
while we have had favorable developments over the past three years  the magnitude of these developments illustrates the inherent uncertainty in our liability for losses and lae  and we believe that favorable or unfavorable developments of similar magnitude  or greater  could occur in the future 
for a detailed description of the major sources of recent favorable developments  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
our reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses gross and net  as well as our case and ibnr reserves were as follows december  in thousands case reserves ibnr lae gross unpaid losses and lae reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae  gross net unpaid losses and lae loss development the following tables show changes in the historical loss reserves  on a gross basis and net of reinsurance  as of the nine years ended december   for eicn and ecic and as of the year ended december   for epic and eac 
these tables are presented on a gaap basis 
the paid and reserve data in the following tables is presented on a calendar year basis 
we commenced operations as a non governmental mutual insurance company on january  when our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund 
paid and reserve data for has not been included in the following tables because a prior to december   the fund was not required to include reserves related to losses and lae for claims occurring prior to july  in its annual statutory financial statements filed with the nevada division of insurance nevada doi consequently  the financial statements made no provision for such liabilities and complete information in respect of those years is not available in a manner that conforms with the information in this table and b for claims occurring subsequent to july  and prior to the company s inception on january   we believe that the loss development pattern was uniquely attributable to nevada workers compensation reforms adopted in the early s  which pattern is not indicative of development that would be expected to be repeated in our prospective operations 
the top line of each table shows the net reserves and the gross reserves for unpaid losses and lae recorded at each year end 
such amount represents an estimate of unpaid losses and lae occurring in that year as well as future payments on claims occurring in prior years 
the upper portion of these tables net and gross cumulative amounts paid  respectively present the cumulative amounts paid during subsequent years on those losses for which reserves were carried as of each specific year 
the lower portions net reserves re estimated show the re estimated amounts of the previously recorded reserve based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the re estimate changes as more information becomes known about the actual losses for which the initial reserve was carried 
an adjustment to the carrying value of unpaid losses for a prior year will also be reflected in the adjustments for each subsequent year 
for example  an adjustment made in the year will be reflected in the re estimated ultimate net loss for each of the years thereafter 
the gross cumulative redundancy deficiency line represents the cumulative change in estimates since the initial reserve was established 
it is equal to the difference between the initial reserve and the latest re estimated reserve amount 
a redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate 
a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate

reinsurance agreements may be proportional in nature  under which the assuming company shares proportionally in the premiums and losses of the ceding company 
this arrangement is known as quota share reinsurance 
reinsurance agreements may also be structured so that the assuming company indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount  which is called an attachment level or retention in return for a premium  usually determined as a percentage of the ceding company s primary insurance premiums 
this arrangement is known as excess of loss reinsurance 
excess of loss reinsurance may be written in layers  in which a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount 
any liability exceeding the coverage limits of the reinsurance program is retained by the ceding company 
the ceding company also bears the credit risk of a reinsurers insolvency 
in accordance with general industry practices  we purchase excess of loss reinsurance to protect against the impact of large individual  irregularly occurring losses  and aggregate catastrophic losses from natural perils and terrorism  which would otherwise cause sudden and unpredictable changes in net income and the capital of our insurance subsidiaries 
reinsurance is used principally to reduce net liability on individual risks  to provide protection for catastrophic losses  and to stabilize underwriting results and preserve working capital 
excess of loss reinsurance our current reinsurance program applies to all loss occurrences during and on policies which are in force between am july  and am july  the reinsurance program consists of three agreements  one excess of loss agreement and two catastrophic loss agreements  entered into between our insurance subsidiaries and current and future affiliates of ehi and the subscribing reinsurers 
we have the ability to extend the term of the treaty to continue to apply to policies which are in force at the expiration of the treaty generally for a period of months 
we may cancel the agreement at any time if any subscribing reinsurer ceases its underwriting operations  becomes insolvent  is placed in conservation  rehabilitation  liquidation  has a receiver appointed or if any reinsurer is unable to maintain a rating by am best and or standard and poor s of at least a throughout the term of the agreement 
covered losses which occur prior to expiration or cancellation of the agreement continue to be obligations of the subscribing reinsurers  subject to the other conditions in the agreement 
the subscribing reinsurers may terminate the agreement only for our breach of the obligations of the agreement 
we are responsible for the losses if the subscribing reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay 
for the program year beginning july   we have purchased reinsurance up to million 
we are solely responsible for any losses we suffer above million except those covered by the terrorism insurance program reauthorization act of our loss retention for the program year beginning july  is million 
this means we have reinsurance for covered losses we suffer between million and million  subject to an aggregate loss cession limitation in the first layer million in excess of million of million 
additionally  in the second through fifth layers of our reinsurance program  our ultimate net loss shall not exceed million for any one life  and we are permitted one reinstatement for each layer upon the payment of additional premium 
the agreements include certain exclusions for which our subscribing reinsurers are not liable for losses  including but not limited to losses arising from the following reinsurance assumed by us under obligatory reinsurance agreements  financial guarantee and insolvency  certain nuclear risks  liability as a member  subscriber or reinsurer of any pool  syndicate or association  but not assigned risk plans  liability arising from participation or membership in any insolvency fund  loss or damage caused by war or civil unrest other than terrorism  certain workers compensation business covering persons employed in minnesota  any loss or damage caused by any act of terrorism involving biological  chemical  nuclear or radioactive pollution or contamination 
we have underwriting guidelines which generally require that insured risks fall within the coverage provided in the reinsurance program 
any risks written outside the reinsurance program require the review and approval of our chief underwriting officer and or chief operating officer 
the agreements provide that we or any subscribing reinsurer may request commutation of any outstanding claim or claims years after the effective date of termination or expiration of the agreements and provide a mechanism for the parties to achieve valuation for commutation 
we may require a special commutation of the percentage share of any loss in the reinsurance program of any subscribing reinsurer that is in runoff 
the significant changes between years from our reinsurance program commencing july  to the reinsurance program commencing july  are as follows improved average aggregate ratings of subscribing reinsurers  and  effective november   our newly acquired insurance subsidiaries were included in our reinsurance program 
our practice is to select reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better at treaty inception as indicated in the table below  which provides information about our reinsurers and their participation in our reinsurance program reinsurer am best rating m excess of m m excess of m m excess of m m excess of m m excess of m arch reinsurance company a aspen reinsurance bermuda a aspen insurance uk limited a axis specialty limited a catlin us obo syndicate a endurance specialty insurance ltd a everest reinsurance us a everest reinsurance bermuda a hannover re bermuda ltd a hannover rueckversicherung ag a lloyds syndicate fdy a lloyds syndicate atr a lloyds syndicate afb a lloyds syndicate sam

the existence of this market rating reflects the chain of security and  in particular  the role of the lloyd s central fund which ensures that each syndicate is backed by capital consistent with a financial strength rating of at least that of the lloyds market 
these syndicates are rated under the overall rating of lloyds 
some syndicates have their own separate rating which is higher than the floor rating 
lpt agreement on july   the nevada legislature enacted senate bill sb 
the provisions of sb specifically stated that the fund could take retroactive credit as an asset or a reduction of liability  amounts ceded to reinsured with assuming insurers with security based on discounted reserves for losses related to periods beginning before july   at a rate not to exceed 
as a result of sb  the fund entered into the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement  in a loss portfolio transfer transaction with third party reinsurers the lpt agreement 
the lpt agreement commenced on june  and will remain in effect until all claims for loss and outstanding loss under the covered policies have closed  the agreement is commuted  or terminated  upon the mutual agreement of the parties  or the reinsurer s aggregate maximum limit of liability is exhausted  whichever occurs earlier 
the lpt agreement does not provide for any additional termination terms 
the lpt agreement substantially reduced the fund s exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks 
on january   our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed all of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  including the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement 
under the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
the lpt agreement  which ceded to the reinsurers substantially all of the fund s outstanding losses as of june  for claims with original dates of injury prior to july   provides coverage for losses up to billion  excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses 
as of december  and  the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were approximately million  and million  respectively 
losses and lae paid with respect to the lpt agreement totaled approximately million and million through december  and  respectively 
the reinsurers agreed to assume responsibilities for the claims at the benefit levels which existed in june the lpt agreement required the reinsurers to each place assets supporting the payment of claims by them in individual trusts that require that collateral be held at a specified level 
the level must not be less than the outstanding reserve for losses and a loss expense allowance equal to of estimated paid losses discounted at a rate of 
if the assets held in trust fall below this threshold  we can require the reinsurers to contribute additional assets to maintain the required minimum level 
the value of these assets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
one of the reinsurers has collateralized its obligations under the lpt agreement by placing the stock of a publicly held corporation  with a value of million at december   in a trust to secure the reinsurer s losses of million 
the value of this collateral is therefore subject to fluctuations in the market price of such stock 
the other reinsurers have placed treasury and fixed income securities in trusts to collateralize their losses 
the current reinsurers party to the lpt agreement include ace bermuda insurance limited  xl mid ocean reinsurance company ltd 
and national indemnity company nico 
the contract provides that during the term of the agreement all reinsurers need to maintain a rating of no less than a as determined by am best 
recoverability of reinsurance reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to the ceding company  or original insurer  to the extent of the reinsurance 
it does not  however  discharge the ceding company from its primary liability to its policyholders in the event the reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under such reinsurance 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
we regularly perform internal reviews of the financial strength of our reinsurers 
however  if a reinsurer is unable to meet any of its obligations to our insurance subsidiaries under the reinsurance agreements  our insurance subsidiaries would be responsible for the payment of all claims and claims expenses that we have ceded to such reinsurer 
we do not believe that our insurance subsidiaries are currently exposed to any material credit risk 
in addition to selecting financially strong reinsurers  we continue to monitor and evaluate our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to credit risks or losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
at december   million was in a trust account for reinsurance related to the lpt agreement and an additional million was collateralized by cash or letter of credit 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance are subject to market conditions and to our experience with insured losses 
there can be no assurance that our reinsurance agreements can be renewed or replaced prior to expiration upon terms as satisfactory as those currently in effect 
if we were unable to renew or replace our reinsurance agreements our net liability on individual risks would increase  we would have greater exposure to catastrophic losses  our underwriting results would be subject to greater variability  and our underwriting capacity would be reduced

inter company reinsurance pooling agreement our insurance subsidiaries are parties to an inter company pooling agreement 
under this agreement  the results of underwriting operations of each company are transferred to and combined with those of the others and the combined results are then reapportioned 
the allocations under the pooling agreement are as follows eicn ecic epic eac the pooling percentages are set forth in the inter company pooling agreement and do not change between periods 
these pooling percentages were established october   the effective date of the agreement  and include our newly acquired insurance subsidiaries epic and eac 
the allocation percentages were  in part  based upon the relative amount of unconsolidated company statutory surplus of the respective companies at the time of the agreement 
our insurance subsidiaries rely on the capacity of the entire pool rather than just on their own capital and surplus 
transactions under the pooling agreement are eliminated on consolidation and have no impact on our consolidated gaap financial statements 
investments we derive investment income from our invested assets 
we invest our insurance subsidiaries total statutory surplus and funds to support our loss reserves and our unearned premiums 
as of december   the total amortized cost of our investment portfolio was billion and the fair market value of the portfolio was billion 
we employ an investment strategy that emphasizes asset quality and considers maturities of fixed maturity securities against anticipated claim payments and expenditures or other liabilities 
the amounts and types of our investments are governed by statutes and regulations in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically over time in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and invest excess cash in securities with appropriate duration targets to balance against anticipated future claim payments 
at december   our investment portfolio  which is classified as available for sale  was made up almost entirely of investment grade fixed maturity securities whose fair values may fluctuate due to the latest interest rate changes 
we strive to limit interest rate risk by managing the duration of our fixed maturity securities 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of 
to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we strive to limit credit risk by investing in a fixed maturity securities portfolio that is heavily weighted toward short term to intermediate term  investment grade securities rated a or better 
our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio shall be aa 
as of december   our fixed maturity securities portfolio had an average quality of aa  with approximately of the carrying value of our investment portfolio rated aa or better 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  changes in market prices of the equity securities we hold in our combined investment portfolio result in increases or decreases in our total assets 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we invest primarily in equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and seek to diversify our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
our objective during the past few years has been to reduce equity exposure as a percentage of our total portfolio by increasing our fixed maturity securities 
our investment strategy allows a maximum exposure of of our total combined investment portfolio in equity securities  with our current equity allocation at of the total portfolio at december  currently  our equity position has fallen below our selected target of due to declining market valuations and the consolidation of the amcomp investment portfolio into ours 
our investment strategy focuses on maximizing economic value through dynamic asset and liability management  subject to regulatory and rating agency constraints  at the consolidated and individual company level 
the asset allocation is reevaluated by the finance committee of the board of directors at a detailed level on a quarterly basis 
we employ conning asset management conning as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our board of directors 
in addition to the construction and management of the portfolio  we utilize investment advisory services of conning 
these services include investment accounting and company modeling using dynamic financial analysis dfa 
the dfa tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives  which in turn  is used in constructing an optimal portfolio 
prior to the acquisition  amcomp employed regions bank to act as its independent investment advisor 
regions bank followed amcomp s written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by amcomp s board of directors 
amcomp s investment portfolio consisted solely of fixed maturity securities 
the portfolio held no asset backed securities except for mortgage backed securities 
as of october   the date of the acquisition  the fair value of amcomp s investment portfolio was million 
subsequent to the acquisition  we consolidated the amcomp investment portfolio into ours  which is managed by conning 
we regularly monitor our portfolio to preserve principal values whenever possible 
all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline is considered to be other than temporary include length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the security until its expected recovery or maturity 
the following table shows the fair value  the percentage of the fair value to total invested assets and the tax equivalent yield based on the fair value of each category of invested assets as of december  category fair value percentage of total yield in thousands  except percentages us treasury securities us agency securities tax exempt municipal securities corporate securities mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities asset backed securities equities total weighted average yield for securities that are redeemable at the option of the issuer and have a fair value that is greater than par value  the maturity used for the table below is the earliest redemption date

our primary underwriting and policy administration system  eaccess  went into production in july eaccess includes the base systems for underwriting evaluation  quoting  rating  policy issuance  policy servicing and endorsements and has been customized to support specific company requirements 
we intend to phase out our legacy policy administration systems by  including the system used by our newly acquired insurance subsidiaries  epic and eac 
claims administration 
in january  we replaced the claims administration system previously used by eicn and ecic and will migrate epic and eac to this system before year end this new system provides enhanced productivity through more efficient processing  improved management reporting and supports business rules that drive more effective claims handling 
business continuity disaster recovery we maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans for our critical business functions  including the restoration of information technology infrastructure and applications 
we have three data centers that act as production facilities as well as disaster recovery sites for each other 
in addition  we utilize an offsite tape storage facility 
regulation holding company regulation nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
under these laws  the respective state insurance departments may examine us at any time  require disclosure of material transactions and require prior notice of  or approval for  certain transactions 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation 
pursuant to applicable insurance holding company laws  eicn is required to register with the nevada doi  ecic is required to register with the california department of insurance california doi  and epic and eac are required to register with the florida oir 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms  charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable  and the insurer s total statutory surplus following any transaction must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its needs 
notice to state insurance regulators is required prior to the consummation of certain affiliated and other transactions involving our insurance subsidiaries and such transactions may be disapproved by the state insurance regulators 
change of control under nevada insurance law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation that became effective on february   for a period of five years following february   no person may acquire or offer to acquire beneficial ownership of five percent or more of any class of our voting securities without the prior approval by the nevada commissioner of insurance nevada commissioner of an application for acquisition 
under nevada insurance law  the nevada commissioner may not approve an application for such acquisition unless the commissioner finds that a the acquisition will not frustrate the plan of conversion as approved by our members and the commissioner  b the board of directors of eicn has approved the acquisition or extraordinary circumstances not contemplated in the plan of conversion have arisen which would warrant approval of the acquisition  and c the acquisition is consistent with the purpose of relevant nevada insurance statutes to permit conversions on terms and conditions that are fair and equitable to the members eligible to receive consideration 
accordingly  as a practical matter  any person seeking to acquire us within five years after february  may only do so with the approval of our board of directors 
on december   the nevada commissioner approved our application to waive any beneficial ownership over if the excess was caused by the stock repurchase program 
in addition  the insurance laws of california  florida and nevada generally require that any person seeking to acquire control of a domestic insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the insurance commissioner 
insurance laws in many states in which we are licensed contain provisions that require pre notification to the insurance commissioner of a change in control of a non domestic insurance company licensed in those states 
control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
generally  other states insurance laws require prior notification to the insurance department of those states of a change of control of a non domiciliary insurance company licensed to transact insurance in that state 
because we have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in california  florida and nevada  and are licensed in numerous other states  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control of us would generally require the party seeking to acquire control to obtain the prior approval of the california  florida and nevada commissioners  and may require pre notification of the change of control in those states that have adopted pre notification provisions 
state insurance regulation insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they conduct business 
as an insurance holding company  we  as well as our insurance subsidiaries  are subject to regulation by the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or transact business 
these state agencies have broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers  including among other things  the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business  license agencies  set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained  determine the nature of  and limitations on  investments and dividends  approve policy forms and rates in some states  periodically examine financial statements  determine the form and content of required financial statements  and periodically examine market conduct 
detailed annual and quarterly financial statements  prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices  and other reports are required to be filed with the insurance regulator in all states in which we are licensed to transact business 
the california doi  florida oir  and nevada doi periodically examine the statutory financial statements of their respective domiciliary insurance companies 
california and nevada are currently examining ecic and eicn 
in florida  workers compensation insurance companies are subject to statutes related to excessive profits 
florida excessive profits are calculated based upon a statutory formula that is applied over rolling three year periods 
workers compensation insurers are required to file annual excessive profit forms and to return any florida excessive profits to policyholders in the form of a cash refund or credit toward future purchase of insurance 
in addition  many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from a particular market 
for example  states may limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies 
furthermore  certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets 
changes in individual state regulation of workers compensation may create a greater or lesser demand for some or all of our products and services  or require us to develop new or modified services in order to meet the needs of the marketplace and to compete effectively in that marketplace 
in addition  many states limit the maximum amount of dividends and other payments that may be paid in any year by insurance companies to their stockholders and affiliates 
this may limit the amount of distributions that may be made by our insurance subsidiaries 
premium rate restrictions among other matters  state laws regulate not only the amounts and types of workers compensation benefits that must be paid to injured workers  but in some instances the premium rates that may be charged by us to insure businesses for those liabilities 
for example  in some states  including florida  wisconsin and idaho  workers compensation insurance rates are set by the state insurance regulators and are adjusted periodically 
this style of rate regulation is referred to as administered pricing 
some of these states allow insurance companies to file rates that deviate upwards or downwards from the benchmark rates set by the insurance regulators 
in the vast majority of states  workers compensation insurers have flexibility to offer rates that reflect the risk assumed by the insurer based on each employer s profile 
these states are referred to as loss cost states 
the majority of the states in which we currently operate  including california and nevada  are loss cost states 
in loss cost states  the state first approves a set of loss costs that provide for expected loss and  in most cases  lae payments  which are prepared by an insurance rating bureau for example  the wcirb in california and the ncci in nevada 
an insurer then selects a factor  known as a loss cost multiplier  to apply to loss costs to determine its insurance rates 
in these states  regulators permit pricing flexibility primarily through a the selection of the loss cost multiplier  and b schedule rating modifications that allow an insurer to adjust premiums upwards or downwards for specific risk characteristics of the policyholder such as type of work conducted at the premises or work environment  on site medical facilities  level of employee safety  use of safety equipment  and policyholder management practices 
financial  dividend and investment restrictions state laws require insurance companies to maintain minimum levels of surplus and place limits on the amount of premiums a company may write based on the amount of that company s surplus 
these limitations may restrict the rate at which our insurance operations can grow 
state laws also require insurance companies to establish reserves for payments of policyholder liabilities and impose restrictions on the kinds of assets in which insurance companies may invest 
these restrictions may require us to invest in assets more conservatively than we would if we were not subject to state law restrictions and may prevent us from obtaining as high a return on our assets as we might otherwise be able to realize absent the restrictions 
the ability of ehi to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay other expenses will be dependent to a significant extent upon the ability of our nevada domiciled insurance company  eicn  and our florida domiciled insurance company  epic  to pay dividends to their immediate holding company  egi and  in turn  the ability of egi to pay dividends to ehi 
nevada law limits the payment of cash dividends by eicn to egi by providing that payments cannot be made except from available and accumulated surplus money otherwise unrestricted unassigned and derived from realized net operating profits and realized and unrealized capital gains 
a stock dividend may be paid out of any available surplus 
a cash or stock dividend otherwise prohibited by these restrictions  such as a dividend from special assigned surplus  may only be declared and distributed upon the prior approval of the nevada commissioner and are considered extraordinary 
special surplus for eicn is assigned surplus funds relating to statutory accounting for retroactive reinsurance and is not available for dividends without prior approval from the nevada commissioner 
eicn must give the nevada commissioner prior notice of any extraordinary dividends or distributions that it proposes to pay to egi  even when such a dividend or distribution is to be paid out of available and otherwise unrestricted unassigned surplus 
eicn may pay such an extraordinary dividend or distribution if the nevada commissioner either approves or does not disapprove the payment within days after receiving notice of its declaration 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined by statute to include any dividend or distribution of cash or property whose fair market value  together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of a of eicn s statutory surplus as regards policyholders at the next preceding december or b eicn s statutory net income  not including realized capital gains  for the month period ending at the next preceding december as of december  and  eicn had positive unassigned surplus of million and million  respectively 
in december  eicn requested and received approval for an extraordinary dividend of million from special surplus from the nevada commissioner 
on may   eicn requested and received approval from the nevada commissioner to increase the million extraordinary divided to million subject to maintaining the risk based capital rbc total adjusted capital of eicn above a specified level on the date of payment after giving effect to such payment 
on august   eicn requested and received approval from the nevada commissioner to increase the extraordinary dividend from million to a total of million subject to the same terms and conditions 
the additional extraordinary dividend provided capital management flexibility 
as of december   million in extraordinary dividends had been paid to ehi 
as the direct owner of ecic  eicn will be the direct recipient of any dividends paid by ecic 
the ability of ecic to pay dividends to eicn is limited by california law  which provides that absent prior approval of the california commissioner  dividends can only be declared from earned surplus 
earned surplus as defined by california law excludes amounts a derived from the net appreciation in the value of assets not yet realized  or b derived from an exchange of assets  unless the assets received are currently realizable in cash 
in addition  california law provides that the appropriate insurance regulatory authorities in the state of california must approve or  within a day notice period  not disapprove any dividend that  together with all other such dividends paid during the preceding months  exceeds the greater of a of ecic s statutory surplus as regards policyholders at the preceding december  or b of the net income for the preceding year 
as of december  and  ecic had positive unassigned surplus of million and million  respectively  paid as a dividend to eicn 
the ability of ecic to pay dividends was further limited by restrictions imposed by the california doi in its approval of our october   reinsurance pooling agreement 
under that approval a ecic must initiate discussions of its business plan with the california doi if its premium to policyholder surplus ratio exceeds to  b ecic will not exceed a ratio of premium to policyholder surplus of to without approval of the california doi  c if at any time ecic s policyholder surplus decreases to or less than the september  balance  ecic shall cease issuing new policies in california but may continue to renew existing policies until it has i received a capital infusion to bring its surplus position to the same level as that as of september  and ii submitted a new business plan to the california doi  d ecic will maintain a rbc level of at least  e should ecic fail to comply with any commitments listed herein  ecic will consent to any request by the california doi to cease issuing new policies in california  but may continue to renew existing policies until such time that as ecic is able to achieve full compliance with each commitment  and f the obligations listed shall only terminate with the written consent of the california doi 
under florida law  without regulatory approval  an insurance company may not pay dividends or make other distributions of cash or property to its stockholders within a month period with a total fair market value exceeding the larger of of surplus as of the preceding december st or of its prior year s net income  not including realized capital gains  or net investment income plus a three year carry forward 
this may limit the amount of dividends that we receive from our florida insurance subsidiaries epic and eac  which in turn may limit the amount of capital available to us for debt service  growth  dividend payments to stockholders  and other purposes 
as the direct owner of eac  epic will be the direct recipient of any dividends paid by eac 
the ability of eac to pay dividends to epic is  in turn  limited by florida law 
as of december   epic and eac had positive unassigned surplus of million and million  respectively 
guaranty fund assessments in most of the states where our insurance company subsidiaries are licensed to transact business  there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business within each such state participate as member insurers in a guaranty association  which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired  insolvent or failed insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premium written by member insurers 
in california  unpaid workers compensation liabilities from insolvent insurers are the responsibility of the california insurance guarantee association ciga 
we pass ciga assessments on to our policyholders  via a surcharge based upon the estimated annual premium at the policy s inception 
we have received  and expect to continue to receive  these guaranty fund assessments  which are paid to ciga based on the premiums written 
as of december   we recorded an asset of million for assessments paid to ciga that includes prepaid policy surcharges still to be collected in the future from policyholders 
we also write workers compensation insurance in other states with similar obligations as those in california 
in these states  we are directly responsible for payment of the assessment 
we recorded an estimate of million and million for our expected liability for guaranty fund assessments at december  and  respectively 
the guaranty fund assessments are expected to be paid within two years of recognition 
property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty fund assessments to our insurance company subsidiaries at some future date 
at this time we are unable to determine the impact  if any  such assessments may have on our financial position or results of operations 
we have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings 
second injury funds most states and all of the states in which we operate have laws that provide for second injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury 
their purpose is to protect employers from higher insurance costs that can occur when a subsequent injury combines with a prior disability to result in substantially increased medical or disability costs than the subsequent injury alone would have produced 
this protects an employer from loss or increased insurance cost because it hires or retains an employee who has a disability 
funding is provided pursuant to individual state statutes or regulations and typically is made by assessments on insurance companies based on premiums paid  losses paid by the fund or losses paid by the insurance industry 
for example  florida has assessed an annual rate of of net premiums written since for its second injury fund 
pooling arrangements in addition  as a condition to conduct business in some states  including california  insurance companies are required to participate in mandatory workers compensation shared market mechanisms  or pooling arrangements  which provide workers compensation insurance coverage to private businesses that are otherwise unable to obtain coverage due  for example  to their prior loss experience 
closed block as required by nevada law  we established a closed block as of february  for the preservation of the reasonable dividend expectations of eligible members and other policyholders 
certain policies entitle the holder to receive distributions from the surplus of eicn in accordance with the terms of a dividend plan or program with respect to such policy 
the closed block was created for the benefit of a all policies issued by eicn that were in force as of february   and that were participating pursuant to a dividend plan or program of eicn and b all policies that were no longer in force as of february   but that were participating pursuant to a dividend plan or program of eicn  that had an inception date that was not earlier than months prior to  and not later  than february   and for which a participating policy dividend has not been calculated  declared and paid by eicn as of february  the requirements for the closed block ended on february  and the remaining funds of approximately million reverted to eicn 
iris ratios the insurance regulatory information system iris is a system established by naic to provide state regulators with an integrated approach to monitor the financial condition of insurers for the purposes of detecting financial distress and preventing insolvency 
iris identifies key financial ratios based on year end data with each ratio identified with a usual range of result 
these ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies 
as of december   our insurance subsidiaries had the following ratios outside the usual range company ratio usual range actual results reason for unusual results eicn investment yield to eicn s investment income increased primarily due to the payment of a dividend from ecic 
eicn liabilities to liquid assets to this ratio is impacted by funds withheld  asset and liability under the inter company pooling agreement 
eicn gross in policyholders surplus to eicn s surplus decreased due to the payment of the extraordinary dividends in the amount of million to ehi 
eicn net change in adjusted policyholders surplus to eicn s surplus decreased due to the payment of the extraordinary dividends in the amount of million to ehi 
ecic liabilities to liquid assets to this ratio is impacted by funds withheld  asset and liability under the inter company pooling agreement 
epic change in net premiums written to net premiums written decreased in connection with the commutation of the historical pooling agreement with eac and entrance into a new pooling agreement with eicn  ecic eac 
epic liabilities to liquid assets to this ratio is impacted by funds withheld  asset and liability under the inter company pooling agreement 
eac change in net premiums written to net premiums written decreased in connection with the commutation of the historical pooling agreement with eac and entrance into a new pooling agreement with eicn  ecic eac 
eac investment yield to low investment yields are due to approval and payment of inter company surplus note interest during the year  which reduces investment income 
surplus note interest is recognized on a statutory accounting basis when approved by the florida oir 
on a gaap basis this expense was accrued as incurred and included in interest expense 
eac liabilities to liquid assets to this ratio is impacted by funds withheld  asset and liability under the inter company pooling agreement 
insurance regulators will generally begin to investigate  monitor or make inquiries of an insurance company if four or more of the company s ratios fall outside the usual ranges 
although these inquiries can take many forms  regulators may require the insurance company to provide additional written explanation as to the causes of the particular ratios being outside of the usual range  the actions being taken by management to produce results that will be within the usual range in future years and what  if any  actions have been taken by the insurance regulator of the insurers state of domicile 
regulators are not required to take action if an iris ratio is outside of the usual range  but depending upon the nature and scope of the particular insurance company s exception for example  if a particular ratio indicates an insurance company has insufficient capital regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance the company can write or revoke the insurers certificate of authority and may even place the company under supervision 
none of our insurance subsidiaries are currently subject to any action by any state insurance department with respect to the iris ratios described above 
risk based capital rbc requirement the naic has adopted an rbc formula to be applied to all insurance companies 
rbc is a method of measuring the amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile 
rbc standards are used by state insurance regulators to determine appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating conditions 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital  defined as the total of its statutory capital and surplus to its rbc 
the company action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its rbc 
at the company action level  a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance regulator that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position 
a company whose total adjusted capital is between and of its rbc is subject to a trend test 
a trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin ie  the amount in dollars by which a company s adjusted capital exceeds its rbc between the current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years  and assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
the regulatory action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its rbc 
at the regulatory action level  the state insurance regulator will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed 
the authorized control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its rbc  at which level the state insurance regulator may take any action it deems necessary  including placing the company under regulatory control 
the mandatory control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than of its rbc  at which level the state insurance regulator is mandated to place the company under its control 
at december   each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed rbc action level 
statutory accounting and solvency regulations state regulation of insurance company financial transactions and financial condition are based on statutory accounting principles sap 
sap differs in a number of ways from gaap  which governs the financial reporting of most other businesses 
in general  sap financial statements are more conservative than gaap financial statements  reflecting lower asset balances  higher liability balances and lower equity 
state insurance regulators closely monitor the financial condition of insurance companies reflected in sap financial statements and can impose significant financial and operating restrictions on an insurance company that becomes financially impaired under sap guidelines 
state insurance regulators generally have the power to impose restrictions or conditions on the activities of a financially impaired insurance company  including the transfer or disposition of assets  the withdrawal of funds from bank accounts  payment of dividends or other distributions  the extension of credit or the advancement of loans  and investments of funds  as well as business acquisitions or combinations 
naic is a group formed by state insurance regulators to discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation  reporting and accounting of and by us insurance companies 
although the naic has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they conduct business  the naic is influential in determining the form in which such laws are enacted 
model insurance laws  regulations and guidelines model laws have been promulgated by the naic as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured 
adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the model laws is a requirement for accreditation of state insurance regulatory agencies by the naic 
insurance operations are also subject to various leverage tests  which are evaluated by regulators and private rating agencies 
our premium leverage ratios  also known as our premium to surplus ratios  as of december  and on a statutory combined basis  were and  respectively  on a premiums written basis as compared to for the workers compensation industry in as a whole 
privacy regulations in  the united states congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act  which  among other things  protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal non public financial information 
subsequently  a majority of states adopted additional regulations to address privacy issues 
these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions  including insurance and finance companies  and require us to maintain appropriate procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our customers and to fully disclose our privacy practices to our customers 
a naic initiative that impacted the insurance industry in was the adoption in of the privacy of consumer financial and health information model regulation  which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the gramm leach bliley act 
in  to further facilitate the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act  the naic adopted the standards for safeguarding customer information model regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to comply with the gramm leach bliley related privacy requirements 
federal legislative changes in response to the tightening of supply or unavailability of insurance and reinsurance following the september  terrorist attacks  the terrorism risk insurance act of act  was enacted on november  the principal purpose of the act was to create a role for the federal government in the provision of insurance for losses sustained in connection with foreign terrorism 
prior to the act  insurance except for workers compensation insurance and reinsurance for losses arising out of acts of terrorism were largely unavailable from private insurance and reinsurance companies 
in december  the terrorism risk act was extended by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra 
while the underlying structure of the act was left intact  the extension included some adjustments 
the workers compensation laws of the various states generally do not permit the exclusion of coverage for losses arising from terrorism or nuclear  biological and chemical attacks 
in addition  we are not able to limit our losses arising from any one catastrophe or any one claimant 
our reinsurance policies exclude coverage for losses arising out of nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological attacks 
under tripra  federal protection is currently provided to the insurance industry for events  including acts of foreign and domestic terrorism  that result in an industry loss of at least million 
in the event of a qualifying industry loss which must occur out of an act of terrorism certified as such by the secretary of the treasury  each insurance company is responsible for a deductible of of direct earned premiums in the previous year  with the federal government responsible to reimburse each company for of the insurer s loss in excess of the insurer s proportionate share of the billion industry aggregate limit in any one year 
accordingly  events may not be covered by  or may result in losses exceeding the capacity of our reinsurance protection and any protection offered by the tripra or any subsequent legislation 
we do not believe that the risk of loss to our insurance subsidiaries from acts of terrorism is significant 
small businesses constitute a large portion of our policies  and we do not intend to write large concentrations of business in any particular market location 
however  the impact of any future terrorist acts is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on our insurance subsidiaries  if any  of losses from any future terrorist acts will depend upon their nature  extent  location and timing 
employees in january  we began implementation of a strategic restructuring plan that includes staff reductions of approximately employees  or of our total workforce 
these reductions began in january and are anticipated to be largely completed by mid year those employees impacted are eligible for severance benefits and outplacement support

risk factors investing in our common stock involves risks 
in evaluating our company  you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all the information included in this annual report 
the risks facing our company include  but are not limited to  those described below 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and stock price and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business our liability for losses and lae is based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses and expenses 
we must establish and maintain reserves for our estimated losses and lae 
we establish loss reserves in our financial statements that represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured claims that have occurred  including claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us 
loss reserves are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques  are inherently uncertain  and do not represent an exact measure of liability 
several factors contribute to the uncertainty in establishing estimated losses  including the length of time to settle long term  severe cases  claim cost inflation deflation trends and uncertainties in the long term outcome of the and legislative reforms in california and the legislative reforms in florida 
judgment is required in applying actuarial techniques to determine the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under current facts and circumstances 
in states other than nevada  we have a relatively short operating history and must rely on a combination of industry experience and our specific experience to establish our best estimate of losses and lae reserves 
the interpretation of historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally legislative changes  medical cost inflation  economic fluctuations and legal trends 
we review our loss reserves each quarter 
we may adjust our reserves based on the results of these reviews and these adjustments could be significant 
any changes in these estimates are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made 
loss reserves are estimates at a given point in time of our ultimate liability for cost of claims and of the cost of managing those claims  and are inherently uncertain 
it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future claim emergence and payment patterns and estimates of future trends in claim frequency and claim cost 
these estimates assume that the claim emergence and payment patterns  claim inflation and claim frequency trend assumptions implicitly built into estimates will continue into the future 
unexpected changes in claim cost inflation can occur through changes in general inflationary trends  changes in medical technology and procedures  changes in wage levels and general economic conditions and changes in legal theories of compensability of injured workers and their dependents 
furthermore  future costs can be influenced by changes in the workers compensation statutory benefit structure and in benefit administration and delivery 
it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
workers compensation benefits are often paid over a long period of time 
in addition  there are no policy limits on our liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the ultimate loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
our estimates of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years have decreased for past accident years because actual losses and lae paid and current projections of unpaid losses and lae were less than we originally anticipated 
we refer to such decreases as favorable developments 
the reductions in reserves were million  million  million  million and million for the years ended december     and  respectively 
estimates of net incurred losses and lae are established by management utilizing actuarial indications based upon our historical and industry experience regarding claim emergence and claim payment patterns  and regarding medical cost inflation and claim cost trends  adjusted for future anticipated changes in claims related and economic trends  as well as regulatory and legislative changes  to establish our best estimate of the losses and lae reserves 
the decrease in the prior year reserves was primarily the result of actual paid losses being less than expected  and revised assumptions used in projection of future losses and lae payments based on more current information about the impact of certain changes  such as legislative changes  which was not available at the time the reserves were originally established 
while we have had favorable developments over the past five years  the magnitude of these developments illustrates the inherent uncertainty in our liability for losses and lae  and we believe that favorable or unfavorable developments of similar magnitude could occur in the future 
state insurance regulations in states where we operate have caused and may continue to cause downward pressure on the premiums we charge 
our pricing decisions need to take into account the workers compensation insurance regulatory regime of each state in which we operate  such as regimes that address the rates that industry participants in that state may or should charge for policies 
in  of our direct premiums written were generated in california 
accordingly  we are particularly affected by regulation in california and to a lesser extent in florida and nevada  our next largest markets 
the passage of any form of rate regulation in california could impair our ability to operate profitably in california  and any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
california has recently been through a cycle of substantial rate decreases 
since  three key pieces of workers compensation regulation reform have been enacted which reformed medical determinations of injuries or illness  established medical fee schedules  allowed for the use of medical provider panels  modified benefit levels  changed the proof needed to file claims  and reformed many additional areas of the workers compensation benefits and delivery system 
workers compensation insurers in california responded to these reforms by reducing their rates 
for example  our rates in california have been reduced by from september through december  these reductions in rates were in response to the legislative reforms of and although the california commissioner does not set premium rates  he does adopt and publish advisory pure premium rates  which are rates that would cover expected losses but do not contain an element to cover operating expenses or profit 
in november  the california commissioner recommended no overall change in pure premium rates for policies written on or after january  this was the first recommendation of no rate decrease by the california commissioner since the reforms of and in october  in response to a recommendation by the wcirb to increase advisory rates by  the california commissioner approved a average increase in advisory pure premium rates on new and renewal policies beginning january  in administered pricing states  insurance rates are set by the state insurance regulators and are adjusted periodically 
rate competition is generally not permitted in these states 
of the states in which we currently operate  florida  wisconsin and idaho have implemented such regulations 
however  we are exposed to the risk that other states in which we operate will adopt administered pricing regulations 
in  florida enacted workers compensation reforms 
as the impact from those reforms continue to be shown  the florida commissioner approved an rate decrease for all new and renewal policies effective january   and an rate decrease for all new and renewal policies effective january   which resulted in a cumulative effective rate decrease of since on february   the florida commissioner approved a increase in workers compensation rates to be effective april   for new and renewal business 
this rate increase was the result of the impact of an october florida supreme court decision that materially impacted the statutory caps on attorney fees that were part of the reforms 
nevada has recently seen downward pressure on premiums 
in december  the nevada commissioner announced that the ncci submitted a filing for an average voluntary loss cost decrease of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march   which was subsequently approved by the nevada commissioner 
according to the nevada commissioner  decreasing claim frequency was cited as the primary driver of the decrease  which more than offsets increasing indemnity and medical costs per claim  the cost of living benefit adjustments that were enacted during the legislative session and the impact of nevada s statutory payroll cap 
in february  the nevada commissioner announced the approval of a filing submitted by the ncci for an average loss cost decrease of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  due to the existence of rate regulation  and the possibility of adverse changes in such regulations  we cannot assure you that our premium rates will ultimately be adequate to cover the claim payments  losses and lae and company overhead or  in the case of states without administered pricing  that our competitors will not set their premium rates at lower rates 
in such event  we may be unable to compete effectively and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to price our insurance policies appropriately  our business competitiveness  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
premiums are based on the particular class of business and our estimates of expected losses and lae and other expenses related to the policies we underwrite 
we analyze many factors when pricing a policy  including the policyholder s prior loss history and industry classification 
inaccurate information regarding a policyholder s past claims experience puts us at risk for mispricing our policies 
for example  when initiating coverage on a policyholder  we must rely on the information provided by the policyholder or the policyholder s previous insurer s to properly estimate future claims expense 
if the claims information is not accurately stated  we may under price our policies by using claims estimates that are too low 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in order to set premium rates accurately  we must utilize an appropriate pricing model which correctly assesses risks based on their individual characteristics and takes into account actual and projected industry characteristics 
adverse economic conditions  such as those that currently exist in the financial and credit markets  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
adverse economic conditions can significantly and adversely affect our business and profitability by leading to workforce reductions by our insureds  which would reduce payrolls upon which our premium is based  requiring us to compete more vigorously on price to retain or attract business  and weakening the ability of our customers to pay us on time  or at all 
our concentrations in california  florida and nevada ties our performance to the business  economic  demographic and regulatory conditions in these states 
any deterioration in the conditions in these states could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business has concentrations in california  florida and nevada  where we generated  and of our direct premiums written for the year ended december   respectively 
accordingly  unfavorable business  economic  demographic  competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could negatively impact our business 
the california  florida and nevada economies have been greatly impacted by the overall economic downturn  tightening of the credit markets and the resulting impacts on the residential real estate markets 
in  these states led the nation in foreclosure rates 
approximately nine percent of our business is construction related and  due to the economic slowdown  payrolls of some of our insureds have decreased 
in addition  many california  florida and nevada businesses are dependent on tourism revenues  which are  in turn  dependent on a robust economy 
the downturn in the national economy and the economies of these states  or any other event that causes deterioration in tourism in these states  could adversely impact small businesses such as restaurants that we have targeted as customers 
the departure or insolvency of a significant number of small businesses from any of these states could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we may be exposed to greater risks than those faced by insurance companies whose business is less concentrated 
for example  our average premium per policy in california as of december  has declined by approximately since the same time in  principally as a result of rate changes  see state insurance regulations in states where we operate have caused and may continue to cause downward pressure on the premiums we charge 
we cannot assure you that there will not be deteriorating conditions in the states in which we have concentrations of business that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
acts of terrorism and catastrophes could expose us to potentially substantial losses and  accordingly  could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
under our workers compensation policies and applicable laws in the states in which we operate  we are required to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature  extent  location and timing of such an act 
we would be particularly adversely affected by a terrorist act  most notably  a terrorist act affecting any metropolitan area where our policyholders have a large concentration of workers 
notwithstanding the protection provided by the reinsurance we have purchased and any protection provided by the terrorism risk insurance act of  or its extension  the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra  the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism has not been eliminated because our excess of loss reinsurance treaty program contains various sub limits and exclusions limiting our reinsurers obligation to cover losses caused by acts of terrorism 
excess of loss reinsurance is a form of reinsurance where the reinsurer pays all or a specified percentage of loss caused by a particular occurrence or event in excess of a fixed amount  up to a stipulated limit 
our excess of loss reinsurance treaties do not protect against nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological events 
if such an event were to impact one or more of the businesses we insure  we would be entirely responsible for any workers compensation claims arising out of such event  subject to the terms of the terrorism risk act  which has been extended by the tripra as modified in  and could suffer substantial losses as a result 
under the tripra  federal protection is currently provided to the insurance industry for events  including acts of foreign and domestic terrorism  that result in an industry loss of at least million 
in the event of qualifying industry loss which must occur out of an act of terrorism certified as such by the secretary of the treasury  each insurance company is responsible for a deductible of of direct earned premiums in the previous year  with the federal government responsible for reimbursing each company for of the insurer s loss in excess of the insurer s loss  up to the insurer s proportionate share of the billion industry aggregate limit in any one year 
accordingly  events may not be covered by  or may result in losses exceeding the capacity of  our reinsurance protection and any protection offered by the tripra or any subsequent legislation 
thus  any acts of terrorism could expose us to potentially substantial losses and  accordingly  could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations also expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes because we may be required to pay benefits to workers who are injured in the workplace as a result of a catastrophe 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  either natural or man made 
to date  we have not experienced catastrophic losses arising from any of these types of events 
any catastrophe occurring in the states in which we operate could expose us to potentially substantial losses and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fact that we write only a single line of insurance may leave us at a competitive disadvantage  and subjects our financial condition and results of operations to the cyclical nature of the workers compensation insurance market 
we face a competitive disadvantage due to the fact that we only offer a single line of insurance 
some of our competitors have additional competitive leverage because of the wide array of insurance products that they offer 
for example  a business may find it more efficient or less expensive to purchase multiple lines of commercial insurance coverage from a single carrier 
because we do not offer a range of insurance products and sell only workers compensation insurance  we may lose potential customers to larger competitors who do offer a selection of insurance products 
the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical in nature  and is characterized by periods of so called soft market conditions in which premium rates are stable or falling  insurance is readily available and insurers profits decline  and by periods of so called hard market conditions  in which rates rise  coverage may be more difficult to find and insurers profits increase 
according to the insurance information institute  since  the property and casualty insurance industry experienced hard market conditions from to  to and to although the financial performance of an individual insurance company is dependent on its own specific business characteristics  the profitability of most workers compensation insurance companies generally tends to follow this cyclical market pattern 
because we only offer workers compensation insurance  our financial condition and operations are subject to this cyclical pattern  and we have no ability to change emphasis to another line of insurance 
for example  during a period when there is excess underwriting capacity in the workers compensation market and  therefore  lower profitability  we are unable to shift our focus to another line of insurance which is at a different stage of the insurance cycle and  thus  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we believe the workers compensation industry is currently experiencing increased price competition and excess underwriting capacity 
this results in lower rate levels and smaller profit margins 
because of cyclicality in the workers compensation market  due in large part to competition  capacity and general economic factors  we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle 
we have experienced significant increased price competition in our target markets since this cyclical pattern has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if our agreements with our principal strategic partners are terminated or we fail to maintain good relationships with them  our revenues may decline materially and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to our strategic partners 
we have agreements with two principal strategic partners  adp and wellpoint  to market and service our insurance products through their sales forces and insurance agencies 
for the year ended december   we generated million of base direct premiums written through adp and million of base direct premiums written through wellpoint 
the base direct premiums written for adp and wellpoint were and of total base direct premiums written during  respectively 
our agreement with adp is not exclusive  and adp may terminate the agreement without cause upon days notice 
although our distribution agreements with wellpoint are exclusive  wellpoint may terminate its agreements with us if the rating of ecic is downgraded and we are not able to provide coverage through a carrier with an am best financial strength rating of b or better 
wellpoint may also terminate its agreements with us without cause upon days notice 
the termination of any of these agreements  our failure to maintain good relationships with our principal strategic partners or their failure to successfully market our products may materially reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we are unable to replace the principal strategic partners with other distributors that produce comparable premiums 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that our principal strategic partners may face financial difficulties  reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services  which may lead to decreased sales of our products and services 
moreover  if either of our principal strategic partners consolidates or aligns itself with another company or changes its products that are currently offered with our workers compensation insurance product  we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to adp and wellpoint  as they collect premiums that are due to us for the workers compensation products that are marketed together with their own products 
adp and wellpoint are obligated on a monthly basis to pass on premiums that they collect on our behalf 
any failure to remit such premiums to us or to remit such amounts on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we do not maintain good relationships with independent insurance agents and brokers  they may sell our competitors products rather than ours  and our revenues or profitability may decline 
we market and sell our insurance products primarily through independent  non exclusive insurance agents and brokers 
these agents and brokers are not obligated to promote our products and can and do sell our competitors products 
we must offer workers compensation insurance products and services that meet the requirements of these agents and their customers 
we must also provide competitive commissions to these agents and brokers 
our business model depends upon an extensive network of local and regional agents and brokers distributed throughout the states in which we do business 
we need to maintain good relationships with the agents and brokers with which we contract to sell our products 
if we do not  these agents and brokers may sell our competitors products instead of ours or may direct less desirable risks to us  and our revenues or profitability may decline 
in addition  these agents and brokers may find it easier to promote the broader range of programs of some of our competitors than to promote our single line workers compensation insurance products 
the loss of a number of our independent agents and brokers or the failure of these agents to successfully market our products may reduce our revenues and our profitability if we are unable to replace them with agents and brokers that produce comparable premiums 
a downgrade in our financial strength rating could reduce the amount of business we are able to write or result in the termination of our agreements with our strategic partners 
rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of an ability to pay claims 
our insurance subsidiaries are currently assigned a group letter rating of a excellent from am best  which is the rating agency that we believe has the most influence on our business 
this rating is assigned to companies that  in the opinion of am best  have demonstrated an excellent overall performance when compared to industry standards 
am best considers a rated companies to have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
this rating does not refer to our ability to meet non insurance obligations and is not a recommendation to purchase or discontinue any policy or contract issued by us or to buy  hold or sell our securities 
the financial strength ratings of am best and other rating agencies are subject to periodic review using  among other things  proprietary capital adequacy models  and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
insurance financial strength ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agents and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy  hold or sell securities 
our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by our financial strength rating 
any downgrade in the financial strength rating of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our business through the loss of existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with independent agents and brokers or strategic partners 
our strategic partner  wellpoint  requires that we offer workers compensation coverage through a carrier rated b or better by am best 
we currently offer this coverage through our subsidiary  ecic 
our inability to offer such coverage could cause a reduction in the number of policies we write  would adversely impact our relationships with our strategic partners and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position 
if ecic s rating were downgraded  and we were not able to enter into an agreement to provide coverage through a carrier rated b or better by am best  wellpoint could terminate its distribution agreements with us 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to enter such an agreement if our rating were downgraded 
if we are unable to obtain reinsurance on favorable terms  our ability to write new policies and to renew existing policies could be adversely affected and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
like other insurers  we manage our risk by buying reinsurance 
reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company  called the ceding company  transfers a portion of insurance risk under policies it has written to another insurance company  called the reinsurer  and pays the reinsurer a portion of the premiums relating to those policies 
conversely  the reinsurer receives or assumes reinsurance from the ceding company 
we currently purchase excess of loss reinsurance 
we purchase reinsurance to cover larger individual losses and aggregate catastrophic losses from natural perils and acts of terrorism  excluding nuclear  biological  chemical and radiological events 
on july   we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through july  the reinsurance program consists of three agreements  one excess of loss agreement and two catastrophic loss agreements 
the program provides coverage up to million per loss occurrence  subject to certain exclusions 
our loss retention for the program year beginning july   is million 
the coverage is subject to an aggregate loss cession limitation in the first layer million in excess of our million retention of million 
additionally  in the second through fifth layers of our reinsurance program  our ultimate net loss shall not exceed million for any one life  and we are permitted one reinstatement for each layer upon the payment of additional premium 
covered losses which occur prior to expiration or cancellation of the reinsurance program continue to be obligations of the reinsurer and subject to the other conditions in the agreement 
we are responsible for these losses if the reinsurer cannot or refuses to pay  see item business reinsurance 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance are all subject to market conditions and to our loss experience 
we cannot be certain that our reinsurance agreements will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration upon terms satisfactory to us 
if we are unable to renew or replace our reinsurance agreements upon terms satisfactory to us  our net liability on individual risks would increase and we would have greater exposure to catastrophic losses 
if this were to occur  our underwriting results would be subject to greater variability and our underwriting capacity would be reduced 
as a result  these consequences could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers  and they may also refuse to pay or may delay payment of losses we cede to them 
although we purchase reinsurance to manage our risk and exposure to losses  we continue to have direct obligations under the policies we write 
we remain liable to our policyholders  even if we are unable to recover from our reinsurers what we believe we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts 
reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them  or they might delay payment 
recently  liquidity and the availability of capital have been restricted as a result of adverse credit market conditions and concerns about the economy 
reinsurers may not have enough liquidity to make timely payments 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit reinsurers access to capital required to operate their businesses and in turn affect payments to us 
losses may not be recovered from our reinsurers until claims are paid  and in the case of long term workers compensation cases  the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we recover the amounts to which we are entitled 
we obtained quota share reinsurance covering the losses incurred prior to july   and we could be liable for all of those losses if the coverage provided by the lpt agreement proves inadequate or we fail to collect from the reinsurers party to such transaction 
at december   we had billion of reinsurance recoverables for paid and unpaid losses and lae of which only million is currently due to us 
with the exception of certain losses assumed from the fund discussed below  these recoverables are unsecured 
if we are unable to collect on our reinsurance recoverables  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
our assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund covered all losses incurred by the fund prior to january   pursuant to legislation passed in the nevada legislature 
we only obtained reinsurance covering the losses incurred prior to july   and we could be liable for all of those losses if the coverage provided by the lpt agreement proves inadequate or we fail to collect from the reinsurers party to such transaction 
on january   our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed all of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  including losses incurred by the fund prior to such date 
our nevada insurance subsidiary also assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement that the fund entered into with third party reinsurers with respect to its losses incurred prior to july  the lpt agreement was a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement under which the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
the lpt agreement provides coverage for losses up to billion  excluding losses for burial and transportation expenses 
accordingly  to the extent that the fund s outstanding losses for claims with original dates of injury prior to juy  exceed billion  they will not be covered by the lpt agreement and we will be liable for those losses to that extent 
paid losses under the lpt agreement totaled million through december  as of december   the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were approximately million 
the reinsurers under the lpt agreement agreed to assume responsibilities for the claims at the benefit levels which existed in june accordingly  if the nevada legislature were to increase the benefits payable for the pre july  claims  we would be responsible for the increased benefit costs to the extent of the legislative increase 
similarly  if the credit rating of any of the third party reinsurers that are party to the lpt agreement were to fall below a as determined by am best or to become insolvent  we would be responsible for replacing any such reinsurer or would be liable for the claims that otherwise would have been transferred to such reinsurer 
for example  in  the rating of one of the original reinsurers under the lpt agreement  gerling dropped below the mandatory a am best rating to b 
accordingly  we entered into an agreement to replace gerling with nico at a cost to us of million 
we can give no assurance that circumstances requiring us to replace one or more of the current reinsurers under the lpt agreement will not occur in the future  that we will be successful in replacing such reinsurer or reinsurers in such circumstances  or that the cost of such replacement or replacements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the lpt agreement also required the reinsurers to each place assets supporting the payment of claims by them in individual trusts that require that collateral be held at a specified level 
the collateralization level must not be less than the outstanding reserve for losses and a loss expense allowance equal to of estimated paid losses discounted at a rate of 
if the assets held in trust fall below this threshold  we can require the reinsurers to contribute additional assets to maintain the required minimum level 
the value of these assets at december  was approximately million 
if the value of the collateral in the trusts drops below the required minimum level and the reinsurers are unable to contribute additional assets  we could be responsible for substituting a new reinsurer or paying those claims without the benefit of reinsurance 
one of the reinsurers has collateralized its obligations under the lpt agreement by placing the stock of a publicly held corporation  with a value of million at december   in a trust to secure the reinsurer s obligation of million 
the value of this collateral is subject to fluctuations in the market price of such stock 
the other reinsurers have placed treasury and fixed income securities in trusts to collateralize their obligations 
for losses incurred by the fund subsequent to june   we are liable for the entire loss  net of reinsurance purchased by the fund 
if the premiums collected by the fund for policies written between july  and december  and the investment income earned on those premiums are inadequate to cover these losses  our reserves may prove inadequate and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to sell policies at rates we deem adequate 
the market for workers compensation insurance products is highly competitive 
competition in our business is based on many factors  including premiums charged  services provided  financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation  policyholder dividends  perceived financial strength and general experience 
in some cases  our competitors offer lower priced products than we do 
if our competitors offer more competitive premiums  dividends or payment plans  services or commissions to independent agents  brokers and other distributors  we could lose market share or have to reduce our premium rates  which could adversely affect our profitability 
we compete with regional and national insurance companies  professional employer organizations  third party administrators  self insurance funds and state insurance funds 
our main competitors in each of the states in which we currently operate vary from state to state but are usually those companies that offer a full range of services in underwriting  loss control and claims 
we compete on the basis of the services that we offer to our policyholders and on ease of doing business rather than solely on price 
our principal competitors include the california state compensation fund  aig  bershire hathaway insurance group  nevada contractors group  zenith national insurance company and liberty mutual insurance companies 
many of our competitors are significantly larger and possess greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
some of our competitors  including the california state compensation insurance fund  benefit financially by not being subject to federal income tax 
intense competitive pressure on prices can result from the actions of even a single large competitor 
competitors with more surplus than us have the potential to expand in our markets more quickly than we can 
additionally  greater financial resources permit an insurer to gain market share through more competitive pricing  even if that pricing results in reduced underwriting margins or an underwriting loss 
many of our competitors are multi line carriers that can price the workers compensation insurance that they offer at a loss in order to obtain other lines of business at a profit 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
adverse capital and credit market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio  our profitability and financial condition 
the capital markets experienced extreme volatility  uncertainty and disruption throughout as an insurer  we have a substantial investment portfolio  comprised principally of debt securities 
government monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio  our profitability  and financial condition by significantly reducing the value of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio  creating net realized capital losses as other than temporary declines occur  resulting in reductions to net income or net unrealized capital losses that could reduce our stockholders equity  reducing interest rates on high quality short term debt securities  thereby materially reducing our net investment income  and making valuation of certain investment securities difficult  potentially leading to significant period to period changes in our estimates of fair values  which could result in significant period to period volatility in our net income and stockholders equity 
if we are unable to realize our investment objectives  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
investment income is an important component of our revenue and net income 
as of december   our investment portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  had a fair value of billion 
for the year ended december   we had million of net investment income 
our investment portfolio is managed by an independent asset manager that operates under investment guidelines approved by our board of directors 
although these guidelines stress diversification and capital preservation  our investments are subject to a variety of risks that are beyond our control  including risks related to general economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations and market volatility 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
for example  general economic conditions may be adversely affected by us involvement in hostilities with other countries and large scale acts of terrorism  or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts 
these and other factors affect the capital markets and  consequently  the value of our investment portfolio 
the outlook for our investment income is dependent on the future direction of interest rates  maturity schedules and cash flow from operations that is available for investment 
the fair values of fixed maturity securities that are available for sale fluctuate with changes in interest rates and cause fluctuations in our stockholders equity 
any significant decline in our investment income as a result of falling interest rates  deterioration in the credit of companies in which we have invested  decreased dividend payments or general market conditions could have an adverse effect on our net income and  as a result  on our stockholders equity and policyholders surplus 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process new and renewal business  provide customer service  administer and make payments on claims  facilitate collections  and  to automatically underwrite and administer the policies we write 
eaccess  our main underwriting and policy administration system  includes the base systems for underwriting evaluation  quoting  rating  policy issuance and servicing  and endorsements 
this system  along with our other systems  enables us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development 
the failure of any of our systems  including due to a natural catastrophe  or the termination of any third party software licenses upon which any of these systems is based  could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business 
as our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions 
if sustained or repeated  a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business  provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a breach of security with respect to our systems could also jeopardize the confidentiality of non public data related to policyholders  claimants  vendors  or our employees  which could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
we rely on user authentication capabilities and use data encryption  but there can be no guarantee that advances in computer capabilities  new computer viruses  programming or human errors  or other events or developments would not result in a breach of our security measures  misappropriations of our proprietary information or an interruption of business operations 
the insurance business is subject to extensive regulation that limits the way we can operate our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation by the insurance regulatory agencies in each state in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed  most significantly by the insurance regulators in the states of california  florida and nevada  in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled 
these state agencies have broad regulatory powers designed primarily to protect policyholders and their employees  not stockholders or other investors 
regulations vary from state to state  but typically address or include standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the types of terms that we can include in the insurance policies we offer  mandates that may affect wage replacement and medical care benefits paid under the workers compensation system  requirements for the handling and reporting of claims  procedures for adjusting claims  which can affect the cost of a claim  restrictions on the way rates are developed and premiums are determined  the manner in which agents may be appointed  establishment of liabilities for unearned premiums  unpaid losses and lae and other purposes  limitations on our ability to transact business with affiliates  mergers  acquisitions and divestitures involving our insurance subsidiaries  licensing requirements and approvals that affect our ability to do business  compliance with all applicable medical privacy laws  potential assessments for the settlement of covered claims under insurance policies issued by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies  and the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay to egi and  in turn  the ability of egi to pay dividends to ehi 
workers compensation insurance is statutorily provided for in all of the states in which we do business 
state laws and regulations provide for the form and content of policy coverage and the rights and benefits that are available to injured workers  their representatives and medical providers 
legislation and regulation also impact our ability to investigate fraud and other abuses of the workers compensation systems where we operate 
our relationships with medical providers are also impacted by legislation and regulation  including penalties for the failure to make timely payments 
regulatory authorities have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including the violation of regulations 
we may be unable to maintain all required approvals or comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations  which are continually undergoing revision and which may be interpreted differently among the jurisdictions in which we conduct business  or to comply with the then current interpretation of such laws and regulations 
in some instances  where there is uncertainty as to applicability  we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry 
these practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities 
we are also subject to regulatory oversight of the timely payment of workers compensation insurance benefits in all the states where we operate 
regulatory authorities may impose monetary fines and penalties if we fail to pay benefits to injured workers and fees to our medical providers in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
the naic has developed a system to test the adequacy of statutory capital  known as rbc  which has been adopted by all of the states in which we operate 
this system establishes the minimum amount of capital and surplus calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles necessary for an insurance company to support its overall business operations 
it identifies insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at the inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net premiums written 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  including supervision  rehabilitation or liquidation 
the need to maintain our risk based capital levels may prevent us from expanding our business or meeting strategic goals in a timely manner 
failure to maintain our risk based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business  see item business regulation iris ratios 
the federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance  however  the current financial crisis has created some support for federal oversight 
we cannot predict whether such federal oversight will be adopted  or what impact such oversight would have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the extensive regulation of our business may affect the cost or demand for our products and may limit our ability to obtain rate increases or to take other actions that we might pursue to increase our profitability 
in addition  we may be unable to maintain all required approvals or comply fully with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations  which are subject to amendment 
further  changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations or interpretations by regulatory authorities could impact our operations  require us to bear additional costs of compliance and impact our profitability 
we are a holding company with no direct operations 
we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to meet our obligations  and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us is restricted by law 
ehi is a holding company that transacts substantially all of its business through operating subsidiaries 
its primary assets are the shares of stock of our operating subsidiaries 
the ability of ehi to meet obligations on outstanding debt  to pay stockholder dividends and to make other payments depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds  and upon the ability of our insurance subsidiaries  eicn and epic  to pay dividends to egi and  in turn  the ability of egi to pay dividends to ehi 
payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future  including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future  see item business regulation financial  dividend and investment restrictions 
as a result  we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries and we may not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock 
our profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation  legislative actions and judicial decisions 
the effects of inflation could cause claims costs to rise in the future 
our reserve for losses and lae includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatment and litigation costs 
in addition  judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claims payments 
to the extent inflation and these legislative actions and judicial decisions cause claims costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
an example of the impact from a judicial decision occurred in october when the florida supreme court ruled in the case emma murray vs 
mariner health inc and ace usa that attorneys who represent injured workers are entitled to reasonable fees 
this decision materially impacted the statutory caps on attorney fees that were part of the reforms 
as a result of this decision  the ncci recommended an increase in overall florida workers compensation costs of 
however  the florida commissioner only approved a rate increase effective april  for new and renewal business 
administrative proceedings or legal actions involving our insurance subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our insurance subsidiaries are involved in various administrative proceedings and legal actions in the normal course of their insurance operations 
our subsidiaries have responded to the actions and intend to defend against these claims 
these claims concern issues including eligibility for workers compensation insurance coverage or benefits  the extent of injuries  wage determinations and disability ratings 
adverse decisions in multiple administrative proceedings or legal actions could require us to pay significant amounts in the aggregate or to change the manner in which we administer claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are dependent on obtaining adequate or additional capital on favorable terms  including from writing new business and establishing premium rates and reserve levels sufficient to cover losses 
continuing adverse financial market conditions could significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  including our access to capital and our cost of capital  including capital that may be required by our subsidiaries 
our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses will generally determine our future capital requirements 
if we have to raise additional capital  equity or debt  financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our stockholders could result 
in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our shares of common stock 
in the case of debt financings  we may be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to freely operate our business 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  we may not have sufficient funds to implement our future growth or operating plans and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the capital and credit markets have recently been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption that have negatively impacted market liquidity conditions 
recently  this volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
continuing disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business  replace maturing debt obligations or access the capital necessary to grow our business 
as a result  we may be forced to delay raising capital or be unable to raise capital on favorable terms  or at all  which could decrease our profitability  significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause rating agencies to reevaluate our financial strength ratings 
in the event current sources of liquidity  including internal sources  do not satisfy our needs  we may have to seek additional financing 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as general market conditions  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry and our credit ratings and credit capacity 
if our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  the inability to access capital could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is largely dependent on the efforts of our management because of its industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with the independent agents and brokers that sell our products 
the loss of any members of our management team could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse affect on our ability to execute on our strategies 
our success depends in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers  experienced underwriting personnel and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business 
the current success of our business is dependent in significant part on the efforts of douglas d 
dirks  our president and chief executive officer  martin j 
welch  the president and chief operating officer of our insurance subsidiaries  and william e 
yocke  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
many of our regional and local officers are also critical to our operations because of their industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with the independent agents and brokers who sell our products 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key executives 
currently  we do not maintain key man life insurance for our executives or senior management team 
if we were to lose the services of members of our management team or key regional or local officers  we may be unable to find replacements satisfactory to us and our business 
as a result  our operations may be disrupted and our financial performance may be adversely affected 
assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds  second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability 
most states require insurance companies licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these obligations are funded by assessments  which can be expected to continue in the future in the states in which we operate 
assessments are levied by guaranty associations within the state  up to prescribed limits  on all insurers doing business in that state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by insurers doing business in that state in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
maximum contributions required by law in any one state in which we currently offer insurance vary between and of premiums written 
we recorded an estimate of million and million for our expected liability for guaranty fund assessments at december  and  respectively 
the assessments levied on us may increase as we increase our premiums written or if we write business in additional states 
in some states  we receive a credit against our premium taxes for guaranty fund assessments 
the effect of these assessments or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business 
most states and all of the states in which we operate have laws that provide for second injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury 
their purpose is to protect employers from higher insurance costs that can occur when a subsequent injury combines with a prior disability to result in substantially increased medical or disability costs than the subsequent injury alone would have produced 
this protects an employer from loss or increased insurance cost because it hires or retains an employee who has a disability 
funding is provided pursuant to individual state statutes or regulations  and typically is made by assessments on insurance companies based on premiums paid  losses paid by the fund  losses paid by the insurance industry 
for example  florida has assessed an annual rate of of net premiums written since for its second injury fund 
further  as a condition to conducting business in some states  insurance companies are required to participate in mandatory worker s compensation shared market mechanisms  or pooling arrangements 
these arrangements provide workers compensation insurance coverage to businesses that are otherwise unable to obtain coverage due  for example  to their prior loss experience 
although we price our product to account for the obligations that we may have under these pooling arrangements  we may not be successful in estimating our liability for these obligations 
accordingly  our prices may not fully account for our liabilities under pooling arrangements  which may cause a decrease in our profits 
further  insolvency of other insurance companies in these pooling arrangements would likely increase the liability of other members in the pool 
the effect of these assessments and mandatory shared market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to grow our business 
risk related to our common stock the price of our common stock may decrease  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  among others quarterly variations in our results of operations  changes in expectations as to our future results of operations  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  announcements of claims against us by third parties  departures of key personnel  changes in law and regulation  results of operations that vary from those expected by securities analysts and investors  and future sales of shares of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies whose shares are traded 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
as a result  the trading price of shares of our common stock may decrease and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid to purchase them 
insurance laws of nevada and other applicable states  certain provisions of our charter documents and nevada corporation law could prevent or delay a change of control and could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
under nevada insurance law and our amended and restated articles of incorporation that became effective upon completion of the conversion  for a period of five years following february  or  if earlier  until such date as we no longer directly or indirectly own a majority of the outstanding voting stock of eicn  no person may directly or indirectly acquire or offer to acquire in any manner beneficial ownership of or more of any class of our voting securities without the prior approval of the nevada commissioner  see item business regulation change of control 
additionally  we have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in california and florida 
the insurance laws of california and florida require prior approval from the california doi and the florida oir for any change of control of the subsidiary domiciled in their respective states 
insurance laws in many other states also contain provisions that require pre notification to the insurance commissioners of a change in control of a non domestic insurance company licensed in those states 
control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
because we have insurance subsidiaries domiciled california  florida and nevada and are licensed in numerous other states  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control of us would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the california commissioner  florida commissioner and the nevada commissioner and may require pre notification in those states that have adopted pre notification provisions upon a change of control 
obtaining these approvals may result in a material delay of  or deter  any such transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals or tender offers  and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control  even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock and beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws could discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control of us  even if our stockholders might consider such a change in control to be in their best interests 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
in particular  our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws include provisions dividing our board of directors into three classes  eliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  permitting our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  imposing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at the stockholder meetings  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby limiting stockholder action to that taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and providing our board of directors with exclusive authority to adopt or amend our by laws 
these provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to replace directors and could have the effect of discouraging a future takeover attempt which is not approved by our board of directors  but which stockholders might consider favorable 
additionally  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we have outstanding indebtedness  which could impair our financial strength ratings and adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and fulfill our debt obligations 
our indebtedness could have significant consequences  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  the execution of our business strategy  acquisitions and other purposes  affecting the way we manage our business due to the restrictive debt covenants  requiring us to provide collateral which restricts our use of funds  requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes  and making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  and limiting our flexibility to plan for  and react quickly to  changing conditions 
risk related to our acquisition we may experience difficulty in integrating the operations of amcomp and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the expansion of our business and operations resulting from the acquisition of amcomp may strain our administrative  operational and financial resources 
the successful integration of amcomp into our operations will require  among other things  the retention and assimilation of its key management  sales and other personnel  the adaptation of technology  information systems and other processes  including internal controls  and the retention and transition of policyholders  agents and brokers 
unexpected difficulties could result in increased expenses and the diversion of substantial time  effort and attention of management from our existing business 
the integration process could create a number of potential challenges and adverse consequences for us  including the possible unexpected loss of key employees  agents and brokers  a loss of sales or an increase in other operating costs 
we may not be able to manage the combined operation effectively or realize any of the expected synergies and cost savings from the amcomp acquisition 
these challenges and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

there is a corresponding change to the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses as well as the deferred reinsurance gain 
a cumulative adjustment to the amortization of the deferred gain is also then recognized in earnings so that the deferred reinsurance gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the lpt agreement

overview we are a specialty provider of workers compensation insurance focused on select small businesses engaged in low to medium hazard industries 
workers compensation is a statutory system under which an employer is required to pay for its employees medical  disability and vocational rehabilitation and death benefit costs for work related injuries or illnesses 
our business has historically targeted businesses located in several western states  primarily california and nevada 
during  we were the second  ninth and twenty third largest non governmental writer of workers compensation insurance in nevada  california and the united states  respectively  based on direct premiums written  as reported by am best 
on october   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of amcomp incorporated amcomp for million 
as a result of this acquisition  we are currently conducting business in states from coast to coast  including concentrations in california  florida and nevada 
we are also licensed to write business in seven additional states and the district of columbia 
we believe this acquisition provides significant opportunity to make progress in executing our strategic goals and achieving our vision of being the leader in the property and casualty insurance industry specializing in workers compensation 
our results of operations for include the acquired operations of amcomp for the period november  through december we believe we benefit by targeting small businesses  a market that is characterized by fewer competitors  more attractive pricing and strong persistency when compared to the us workers compensation insurance industry in general 
as a result of our disciplined underwriting standards  we believe we are able to price our policies at levels which are competitive and profitable 
our approach to underwriting is therefore consistent with our strategy of not sacrificing profitability and stability for top line revenue growth 
in  we wrote and of our direct premiums written in california and nevada  respectively 
we market and sell our workers compensation insurance products through independent local and regional agents and brokers  and through our strategic distribution partners  including our principal strategic partners  adp  inc adp and wellpoint  inc wellpoint 
in  we wrote million  or  of our gross premiums written through adp and wellpoint 
we commenced operations as a private domestic mutual insurance company on january  when our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the assets  liabilities and operations of the nevada state industrial insurance system the fund 
the fund had over years of workers compensation experience in nevada 
in july  we acquired the renewal rights to a book of workers compensation insurance business  and certain other tangible and intangible assets  from fremont compensation insurance group and its affiliates fremont  primarily comprising accounts in california and  to a lesser extent  in idaho  montana  utah and colorado 
because of the fremont transaction  we were able to establish our important relationships and distribution agreements with adp and wellpoint 
in connection with our january  assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement with third party reinsurers  which substantially reduced exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks 
pursuant to the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae  which represented substantially all of the fund s outstanding losses as of june  for claims with original dates of injury prior to july  entry into the lpt agreement resulted in a deferred reinsurance gain in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and this deferred gain is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
in addition  we receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
increases and decreases in the contingent commission are reflected in our commission expense  see results of operations 
we operate in a single reportable segment with territorial offices serving the various states in which we are currently doing business 
the workers compensation insurance market is highly competitive 
our strategy across market cycles is to maintain underwriting profitability  manage our expenses and focus on underserved markets within our targeted classes of businesses that we believe will provide greater opportunities for profitable returns 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the following net premiums earned 
our net premiums earned have historically been generated primarily in california and nevada 
in california  we have reduced our premium rates by from september through december   including a decline of since january  based on our internal actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss cost trends 
this compared with the recommendation of the california commissioner of insurance california commissioner of a rate decline since january  in november  the california commissioner recommended that there be no overall change in pure premium rates for policies written on or after january  this was the first recommendation of no rate decrease by the california commissioner since the adoption of the benefit reforms of and in may  the california commissioner announced that stability in the workers compensation insurance marketplace had eliminated the need for an interim pure premium rate advisory 
in october  in response to a recommendation by the california workers compensation insurance rating bureau wcirb to increase advisory rates by  the california commissioner approved a average increase in advisory pure premium rates 
the recommendation of the wcirb does not reflect the cost impact of proposed changes to the permanent disability rating schedule pdrs 
if the proposed changes are adopted  the wcirb has indicated that it will amend its recommendation to increase pure premium rates by an additional 
the wcirb has also indicated that it will recommend that pure premium rates applicable to the unexpired portion of the policies be increased by for the pdrs change 
based on our most recent analysis of california loss trends  medical cost inflation and the competitive market  we have filed for an overall average rate increase for new or renewal policies incepting on or after february  if the pdrs change is adopted  we will re evaluate the adequacy of our rate level and may decide to amend our filing 
in nevada  our rate level decreased in as a result of a decision by the nevada commissioner of insurance nevada commissioner to decrease loss costs effective march  by  which we subsequently adopted 
in february  the nevada commissioner announced the approval of a filing submitted by the national council on compensation insurance ncci for an average loss cost decrease of for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  according to the nevada commissioner  decreasing claim frequency was cited as the primary driver of the proposed decrease  which more than offset increasing indemnity and medical costs per claim  the cost of living benefit adjustments that were enacted during the legislative session and the impact of the payroll cap 
our nevada rates continue to be based upon our internal actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss trends 
we have filed for an average rate decrease for new and renewal policies incepting on or after march  we cannot determine the effect on our profitability at this time  or if there will be continued downward pricing pressure in nevada 
we experienced a decline in the number of policies in force in nevada in  which was the result of overall economic conditions and competitive pressures 
excluding the impacts of the acquisition of amcomp  our policy count growth  primarily in california  mitigated some of the decline in premiums we experienced as a result of declining rate levels and the affects of the economic recession 
companywide  we expect to see continued downward pressure on premiums in  which will be partially offset by policy count growth  including growth attributable to the acquisition of amcomp 
it is uncertain how these trends will impact profitability 
including the acquired operations of amcomp  approximately of our business will be generated in florida 
florida is an administered pricing state and rate changes adopted by the florida commissioner of insurance florida commissioner will affect the rates that we are able to charge in that state 
in  florida enacted workers compensation reforms 
the reforms have resulted in significant declines in claim frequency  an improvement in loss development and a reduction in the cost of claims 
as a result  the florida commissioner approved an rate decrease for all new and renewal policies effective january  and an rate decrease for all new and renewal policies effective january   a cumulative effective rate decrease of since on january   the florida commissioner announced that he would approve a increase in workers compensation rates to be effective april   for new and renewal business 
this proposed rate increase is the result of the impact of an october florida supreme court decision that materially impacted the statutory caps on attorney fees that were part of the reforms 
we cannot determine the full effect on our profitability at this time or if there will be continued downward pricing pressure in florida 
net investment income and realized gains losses on investments 
we invest our statutory surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae in fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
in addition  a portion of these funds is held in cash and cash equivalents to pay current claims 
net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities less bank service charges  custodial and portfolio management fees 
realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
realized gains losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original cost equity securities or amortized cost fixed maturity investments 
net unrealized gains or losses on our securities are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
we monitor our portfolio to preserve principal values whenever possible 
all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
when  in the opinion of management  an impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the security is written down to its fair value and the amount written down is recorded in earnings as a realized loss on investments in the period in which other than temporary determination is made 
conning asset management conning  our portfolio manager  follows our written investment guidelines based on strategies approved by our board of directors 
our investment strategy focuses on maximizing economic value through dynamic asset liability management  subject to regulatory and rating agency constraints 
the fixed maturity securities portion of our portfolio maintains a duration target of and a maximum tax exempt capacity of not more than of the total fixed maturity portfolio 
the equity portion of our portfolio has an authorized allocation range of 
decreasing the equity allocation has the effect of decreasing surplus volatility because under statutory accounting principles  equity securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains losses charged directly to surplus in contrast to fixed income securities which are carried at amortized cost with no impact on surplus due to changes in fair value 
at year end  our equity position has fallen below our selected target of to due to current economic conditions  market volatility and the consolidation of the amcomp investment portfolio 
the decreasing equity allocation has helped to increase the tax equivalent investment yield from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  our tax exempt allocation is supported by our strong operating profitability and tax paying status 
as this process is dynamic in nature and reviewed at a detailed level on a quarterly basis  there could be further changes in the duration and allocation of the portfolio 
expenses our expenses consist of the following losses and lae 
losses and lae represent our largest expense item and include claim payments made  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
the quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and lae  which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques 
in states other than nevada  we rely on a combination of industry experience and our specific experience to establish our best estimate of losses and lae reserves 
the interpretation of historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally regulatory changes  economic fluctuations and legal trends 
in recent years  we experienced lower losses and lae in california than we anticipated due to factors such as regulatory reform designed to reduce loss costs in that market and lower than expected inflation 
the joint marketing of our workers compensation insurance with wellpoint s health insurance products also assists in reducing losses since employees make fewer workers compensation claims because they are insured for non work related illnesses or injuries and thus are less likely to seek treatment for a non work related illness or injury through their employers workers compensation insurance carrier 
commission expense 
commission expense includes commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us  and is net of contingent commission income related to the lpt agreement 
commissions paid to our agents and brokers are deferred and amortized to commission expense in our statements of income as the premiums generating these commissions and fees are earned 
we pay commissions that we believe are competitive with other workers compensation insurers 
underwriting and other operating expenses 
underwriting and other operating expenses include the costs to acquire and maintain an insurance policy excluding commissions consisting of premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with  and are primarily related to  producing new or renewal business 
these acquisition costs are deferred and amortized to underwriting and other operating expenses in the statement of income as the related premiums are earned 
other underwriting expenses consist of policyholder dividends  changes in estimates of future write offs of premiums receivable  general administrative expenses such as salaries  rent  office supplies  depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately  and boards  bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and administration items such as rating manuals  rating plans and experience data 
our underwriting and other operating expenses ratio percentage of net premiums earned is a reflection of our operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering our business 
critical accounting policies management believes it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers some of these policies to be very important to the presentation of our financial results because they require us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ from these estimates 
management believes that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for losses and lae  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from reinsurers  recognition of premium revenue  deferred income taxes and the valuation of investments 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are directly liable for losses and lae under the terms of insurance policies our insurance subsidiaries underwrite 
significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
our loss reserves are reflected in our balance sheets under the line item caption unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
as of december   our reserve for unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was billion 
accounting for workers compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and lae  referred to as loss reserves  as of a balance sheet date 
our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and lae of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid 
management establishes the loss reserve based on its own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions 
our aggregate carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae is a point estimate  which is the sum of our reserves for each accident year in which we have exposure 
this aggregate carried reserve calculated by us represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and lae 
maintaining the adequacy of the loss reserve estimate is an inherent risk of the workers compensation insurance business 
as described below  workers compensation claims may be paid over a long period of time 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may involve more uncertainty than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the claim amount 
the amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development 
reserve development is unfavorable when payments for losses are made for more than the levels at which they were reserved or when subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims 
in this case  the previously estimated loss reserves are considered deficient 
reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves 
in this case  the previously estimated loss reserves are considered redundant 
reserve development  whether due to an increase or decrease in the aggregate estimated losses  is reflected in operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and lae during the accounting period in which the development is recognized 
although claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more  we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money 
the three main components of our reserves for unpaid losses and lae are case reserves  incurred but not reported or ibnr reserves  and lae reserves 
case reserves are estimates of future claim payments based upon periodic case by case evaluation and the judgment of our claims adjusting staff  as applied at the individual claim level 
our claims examiners determine these case reserves for reported claims on a claim by claim basis  based on the examiners judgment and experience and on our case reserving practices 
we update and monitor our case reserves frequently as appropriate to reflect current information 
our case reserving practices account for the type of occupation or business  the circumstances surrounding the claim  the nature of the accident and of the resulting injury  the current medical condition and physical capabilities of the injured worker  the expected future course and cost of medical treatment and of the injured worker s disability  the existence of dependents of the injured worker  policy provisions  the statutory benefit provisions applicable to the claim  relevant case law in the state  and potentially other factors and considerations 
ibnr is an actuarial estimate of future claim payments beyond those considered in the case reserve estimates  relating to claims arising from accidents that occurred during a particular time period on or prior to the balance sheet date 
thus  ibnr is the compilation of the estimated ultimate losses for each accident year less amounts that have been paid and case reserves 
ibnr reserves  unlike case reserves  do not apply to a specific claim  but rather apply to the entire body of claims arising from a specific time period 
ibnr primarily provides for costs due to future claim payments in excess of case reserves on recorded open claims  additional claim payments on closed claims  and the cost of claims that have not yet been reported to us 
most of our ibnr reserves relate to estimated future claim payments over and above our case reserves on recorded open claims 
for workers compensation  most claims are reported to the employer and to the insurance company relatively quickly  and relatively small amounts are paid on claims that already have been closed which we refer to as reopenings 
consequently  late reporting and reopening of claims are a less significant part of ibnr for our insurance subsidiaries 
lae reserves are our estimate of the diagnostic  legal  administrative and other similar expenses that will be incurred in the future managing claims  including ibnr  that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date 
lae reserves are established in the aggregate  rather than on a claim by claim basis 
a portion of our losses and lae obligations are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 
we establish our losses and lae reserves both gross and net of ceded reinsurance 
the determination of the amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and lae reserves includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance policies  as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the lpt agreement 
our reinsurance arrangements also include an intercompany pooling arrangement between eicn  ecic  epic and eac  whereby each insurance subsidiary cedes some of its premiums  losses  and lae to the other  but this intercompany pooling arrangement does not affect our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
our reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses gross and net  as well as the above described main components of such reserves  were as follows december  in thousands case reserves ibnr lae gross unpaid losses and lae reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae  gross net unpaid losses and lae workers compensation is considered to be a long tail line of insurance  meaning that there can be an extended elapsed period between when a claim occurs when the worker is injured on the job and the final payment and resolution of the claim 
as discussed above  the long tail for workers compensation usually is not caused by a delay in the reporting of the claim 
the vast majority of our workers compensation claims are reported very promptly 
the long tail for workers compensation is caused by the fact that benefits are often paid over a long period of time  and many of the benefit amounts are difficult to determine in advance of their payment 
our obligations with respect to an injured worker may include medical care and disability related payments for the duration of the injured worker s disability  in accordance with state workers compensation statutes  all of which payments are considered as part of a single workers compensation claim and are our responsibility if we were providing coverage to the employer on the date of injury 
for example  in addition to medical expenses  an injured worker may receive payments for lost income associated with total or partial disability  whether temporary or permanent ie  the disability is expected to continue until normal retirement age or death  whichever comes first 
we may also be required to make payments  often over a period of many years  to surviving spouses and children of workers who are killed in the course and scope of their employment 
the specific components of injured workers benefits are defined by the laws in each state 
based on historical insurance industry experience countrywide  as reported by am best  approximately ten percent of workers compensation claim dollars are expected to be paid more than ten years after the claim occurred 
while our payout pattern likely will differ from that of the industry  industry experience illustrates the general duration of workers compensation claims 
the duration of the injured worker s disability  the course and cost of medical treatment  as well as the lifespan of dependents  are uncertain and are difficult to determine in advance 
we endeavor to minimize this risk by closing claims promptly  to the extent feasible 
in addition  there are no policy limits on our liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
we endeavor to mitigate this risk by purchasing reinsurance that will provide us with financial protection against the impact of very large claims and catastrophes 
although we update and monitor our case reserves frequently as appropriate to reflect current information  it is very difficult to set precise case reserves for an individual claim due to the inherent uncertainty about the future duration of a specific injured worker s disability  the course and cost of medical care for that injured worker  and the other factors described above 
therefore  in addition to establishing case reserves on a claim by claim basis  we  like other workers compensation insurance companies  establish ibnr reserves based on analyses and projections of aggregate claims data 
evaluating data on an aggregate basis eliminates some of the uncertainty associated with an individual claim 
however  considerable uncertainty remains as many claims can be affected simultaneously by changes in environmental conditions such as medical technology  medical costs and medical cost inflation  economic conditions  the legal and regulatory climate  and other factors 
the cost of a group of workers compensation claims is not known with certainty until every one of the claims is ultimately closed 
unpaid lae is also estimated and monitored 
the amount that will be spent managing claims will depend on the duration of the claims  the course of the injured worker s disability and medical treatment  the nature and degree of any disputes relating to our obligations to the claimant  the administrative and legal environment in which issues are addressed and resolved  and the cost of the company personnel and other resources that are used in the management of claims 
therefore  our lae reserves also contribute to the overall uncertainty of our aggregate reserve for unpaid losses and lae 
for the reasons described above  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other lines of insurance with shorter or more definite periods between occurrence of the claim and final determination of the ultimate loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and lae 
actuarial methodologies are used by workers compensation insurance companies  including us  to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of unpaid losses and lae 
as mentioned above  management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions  among other factors  in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
judgment is required in the actuarial estimation of unpaid losses and lae 
the judgments include the selection of methodologies to project the ultimate cost of claims  the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data  industry data  and other benchmarks  the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations caused by internal or external factors  and  the weighting of differing reserve indications that result from alternative methods and assumptions 
the adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves  which are based on estimates  is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business  which we attempt to mitigate through our claims management process and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims 
however  no assurance can be given as to whether the ultimate liability will be more or less than our loss reserve estimates 
we retain independent consulting actuaries consulting actuaries to perform comprehensive studies of our losses and lae liability on a semi annual basis 
the role of our consulting actuaries is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates  as well as a point estimate  of our unpaid losses and lae liability  and to present those results to our actuarial staff and to management 
for purposes of analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time  we compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year or quarter in which the claim occurred accident year or accident quarter  since each such group of claims is at a different stage of progression toward the ultimate resolution and payment of those claims 
the claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims and or claimant benefits 
for our nevada business  where a substantial detailed historical database is available from the fund from which our nevada insurance subsidiary  eicn  assumed assets  liabilities and operations in  these separate groupings of benefit types include death  permanent total disability  permanent partial disability  temporary disability  medical care and vocational rehabilitation 
third party subrogation recoveries are separately analyzed and projected 
both the consulting actuaries and the internal actuarial staff select and apply a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods to our data 
the methods applied vary somewhat according to the type of claim benefit being analyzed 
the primary methods utilized in recent evaluations are as follows paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
a method assigning partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
this method is used to evaluate both our nevada business and our other than nevada business 
reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
a method assigning partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
this method is used to evaluate our other than nevada business 
paid development method 
a method that uses actual historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year to develop estimated ultimate losses 
the overall development is based on the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate  for the expected effects of known changes in the workers compensation environment  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
this method is used to evaluate both our nevada business and our other than nevada business 
for our nevada business  an additional variant of this method is used that involves adjusting historical data for inflation to common cost level  and projecting future loss payments at selected inflation rates 
reported development method 
a method that uses actual historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year to develop estimated ultimate losses 
the overall development is based on the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate  for the expected effects of known changes in the workers compensation environment  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
this method is used to evaluate our other than nevada business 
frequency severity method 
this method separately projects the ultimate number of claims for an accident year  based on historical claim reporting patterns  and the average cost per claim 
the average cost per claim is projected both by inflation adjusting other accident years average cost per claim  and by observing and extrapolating based on historical patterns in the per claim cost observed to date for the accident year 
this method is used to evaluate our nevada business 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used directly  and also as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on one or more of industry benchmark losses per dollar of payroll for the mix of employment classes insured  prior evaluation dates projections of ultimate losses for the accident year  and by applying to premiums a set of initial expected loss ratios selected after analyzing the development projections for each accident year  loss trends  statutory benefit changes  rate change  and historical company loss ratios 
each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
the key parameters and assumptions are the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  claims cost inflation rates  and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
of these  we believe the most important are the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time and claims cost inflation rates 
each of these key items is discussed in the following paragraphs 
all of the methods depend in part on the selection of an expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time 
we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical patterns with which claims have emerged and have been paid 
to the extent that the historical data may not provide sufficient information about future patterns  whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business  benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rate bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our subsidiaries historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the losses and lae reserves at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate that the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  that new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies gradually  so that the projections will not overreact to what may turn out to be a temporary or unwarranted assumption about changes in patterns 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop many years or decades in the future  and it is likely that the actual development that will occur in the distant future could differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections 
the current projections would differ if different claims development patterns were selected for each benefit type 
the expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time is expressed as a percentage of ultimate losses that remain to be paid at each evaluation date for each accident year 
a lower estimate of the percentage of aggregate claims dollars remaining to be paid  when applied in the actuarial methods  produces a lower dollar estimate of the unpaid loss 
the payment patterns are reviewed each year based on the observed recent and long term patterns in our own historical data  recent and long term patterns in industry data  and analyses of potential changes in patterns resulting from major legislative benefit changes 
in particular  the changes in the payment patterns used in california were significantly influenced by analysis of the anticipated effects of the legislation relating to workers compensation benefits  as well as observations of our early experience as it emerged of claims experience subsequent to the enactment of that legislation 
at each reserve evaluation  as more claims experience has emerged subsequent to that legislation  the post legislative claims experience has been given increasing judgmental weight in the actuarial selection of expected future payment patterns 
the actual payout pattern for the aggregate claims associated with an accident year will not be known until decades later  when all the claims are closed 
several of the methods also involve adjusting historical data for inflation 
for these methods  the inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year to year movements in the cost of claims observed in the data of our insurance subsidiaries and in industry wide data  as well as on broader inflation indices 
the results of these methods would differ if different inflation rates were selected 
in projections using december  data  the methods that use explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation assumptions ranging from to 
corresponding medical cost inflation assumptions in prior projections were to at december  and to at december  the selection of medical cost inflation assumptions for use in the actuarial methodologies in each of these analyses has been based on observed recent and longer term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the us economy more generally 
the rate of medical cost inflation as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim has averaged approximately over the past five to ten years 
the rate of medical cost inflation in the general us economy  as measured by the consumer price index medical care  has averaged approximately over the past ten years 
several of the actuarial methods depend on assumptions about claim frequency trends 
we examine the overall movement in the frequency  or number  of claims  as well as movements in the relative frequency of claims of different severities  as measured by the proportions of claims receiving different levels of benefit payments 
judgments about the relative proportion of claims from the most recent years that ultimately will receive benefit payments at different levels are based on historical and recent levels and movements of our claim counts and form the basis for the projection of the ultimate number of claims that will receive benefits payments for each benefit type 
the methods employed for each segment of claims data  and the relative weight accorded to each method  vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims 
for claim or benefit types that pay out for many years  and for the most recent accident periods in which the claims are relatively immature  more weight is given to methods that tend to produce more stable results by including initial expected losses or claim severities that are estimated in part by reliance on other accident years adjusted for inflation and other factors to the level of the accident year being analyzed 
all of the actuarial methods described for our nevada business are used for each of the different benefit types that are analyzed 
for benefit types in which most of the loss dollars are paid out within several years of the claim occurrence temporary total disability  permanent partial disability and vocational rehabilitation  the selection of ultimate losses for all but the most recent three to five accident years is based primarily on the results of the paid development method 
this is due to the expectation that ultimate losses for the mature years will be highly correlated with the losses that have been paid to date  and the selection of estimated ultimate losses for the least mature accident years gives consideration to the results of all of the methods with the paid development method given the least consideration in the least mature that is  most recent accident year 
for benefit types that typically involve payments extending over many years or even decades permanent total disability  dependent benefits on fatal claims  and medical care benefits the ultimate losses for the most recent ten or more accident years may not be highly correlated with the amounts paid to date and thus the selection of estimated ultimate losses for these recent accident years is based primarily on the frequency severity method  the paid bornhuetter ferguson method and the initial expected loss method  all of which rely in part on long term observations regarding the average cost of claims of the particular benefit type and  in the case of medical care benefits  also allow for explicit medical cost inflation assumptions 
in states other than nevada  the paid bornhuetter ferguson  reported bornhuetter ferguson  paid development  and reported development methods are used for all benefit types 
as our claims experience in these states is less mature  the bornhuetter ferguson methods are given greater weight in the selection of estimated ultimate losses because these methods do not produce results that are as highly leveraged off our immature paid or reported claims experience 
for eicn  the analysis of unpaid loss is conducted on claims data prior to recognition of reinsurance 
a separate projection is made of future reinsurance recoveries based on our reinsurance arrangements and an analysis of large claims experience  both for eicn and as reflected in industry based benchmarks 
the projections prior to recognition of reinsurance provide the basis for estimating gross of reinsurance unpaid losses  from which the projection of future reinsurance recoveries is subtracted to estimate net of reinsurance unpaid losses 
for ecic  the analysis of unpaid loss is conducted on claims data net of reinsurance  and a separate projection is made of future reinsurance recoveries  which is added to the estimated net of reinsurance unpaid losses to estimate gross of reinsurance unpaid losses 
for epic and eac  the analysis of unpaid losses is conducted for various retention levels corresponding to their historical reinsurance program structure 
for eicn and ecic  management along with internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary separately analyze lae and estimate unpaid lae 
this analysis relies primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amount that has been spent on lae historically and the dollar volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods 
based on these historical relationships  and judgmental estimates of the extent to which claim management resources are focused more intensely on the initial handling of claims than on the ongoing management of claims  the consulting actuary selects a range of future lae estimates that is a function of the projected future claim payment activity 
the portion of unpaid lae that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms 
for epic and eac  the defense and cost containment portion of lae is analyzed in combination with the evaluation of losses utilizing the methodologies described above ie bornuetter ferguson  paid development  etc based on the results of the analyses conducted  the stability of the historical data  and the characteristics of the various claims segments analyzed  the consulting actuaries select a range of estimated unpaid losses and lae and a point estimate of unpaid losses and lae  for presentation to internal actuarial staff and management 
the selected range is intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall 
this range is narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely  although it is possible  that the high or low result will emerge for every state  benefit type and accident year 
the actuarial point estimate of unpaid losses and lae is based on a judgmental selection for each benefit type from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods 
management formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis 
in doing so  we make reference to the most current analyses of our consulting actuaries  including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used by the consulting actuaries 
comprehensive studies are conducted as of june and december by both internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuaries and on the alternate quarters  the preceding study results are updated for actual claim payment activity during the quarter 
the consulting actuary  provides the following analyses using information provided by the company claim frequency and claim severity trends indicated by the claim activity as well as any emerging claims environment or operational issues that may indicate changing trends  and workers compensation industry trends as reported by industry rate bureaus  in the media  and other similar sources 
management determines the ibnr and lae components of our loss reserves by establishing a point in the range of the consulting actuary s most recent analysis of unpaid losses and lae with the selection of the point based on management s own view of recent and future claim emergence patterns  payment patterns  and trends information obtained from internal actuarial staff pertaining to view of the markets in which we are operating  including economic  business  and political conditions  the characteristics of the business we have written in recent quarters  recent and pending recoveries from reinsurance  our view of trends in the future costs of managing claims  and other similar considerations as we view relevant 
the aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and lae 
we believe that we should be conservative in our reserving practices due to the long tail nature of workers compensation claims payouts  the susceptibility of those future payments to unpredictable external forces such as medical cost inflation and other economic conditions  and the actual variability of loss reserve adequacy that we have observed in the workers compensation insurance industry 
at december   management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was billion  which was million above the actuarial point estimate 
in establishing its best estimate at december   management and internal actuarial staff reviewed and considered a the consulting actuaries assumptions  point estimate and range  b the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation unpaid losses and lae liabilities  and c the particular uncertainties associated with i the potential effects on the cost and payout pattern of claims following workers compensation system reforms enacted by the california legislature in late and the regulatory implementation of those reforms  the effects of which will become clear over a number of years  ii the uncertain cost of administering claims lae in the reformed california and florida systems  iii the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of california and florida reforms  iv the rapid growth in the volume of our business in california  and v the degree of movement observed in eicn s prior years projections of losses and lae in nevada following premium and market share reductions 
management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each of these sources of uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for unpaid losses and lae that  in management s opinion  represented a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  in light of the historical data  the actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  current facts and circumstances  and the sources of uncertainty identified by management 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  fell within the actuarial range of estimates 
the decrease in management s best estimate relative to the actuarial point estimate from december  to december  decreased losses and lae expense incurred by million for the year ended december  at december   management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was billion  which was million above the actuarial point estimate 
in establishing its best estimate at december   management and internal actuarial staff reviewed and considered a the consulting actuary s assumptions  point estimate and range  b the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation unpaid losses and lae liabilities  and c the particular uncertainties associated with i the potential effects on the cost and payout pattern of claims following workers compensation system reforms enacted by the california legislature in late and the regulatory implementation of those reforms  the effects of which will become clear over a number of years  ii the uncertain cost of administering claims lae in the reformed california system  iii the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of california reforms  iv the rapid growth in the volume of our business in california  v the limited historical experience of ecic to use as a base for projecting future loss development  and  vi the degree of movement observed in eicn s prior years projections of losses and lae in nevada following premium and market share reductions 
management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each of these sources of uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for unpaid losses and lae that  in management s opinion  represented a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  in light of the historical data  the actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  current facts and circumstances  and the sources of uncertainty identified by management 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  fell within the actuarial range of estimates 
the increase in management s best estimate relative to the actuarial point estimate from december  to december  increased losses and lae expense incurred by million for the year ended december  at december   management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was billion  which was million above the actuarial point estimate 
in establishing its best estimate at december   management considered a the actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  b the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation unpaid losses and lae liabilities  and c the particular uncertainties associated with i the potential effects on the cost and payout pattern of claims following workers compensation system reforms enacted by the california legislature in late and the regulatory implementation of those reforms  the effects of which will become clear over a number of years  but which our initial experience indicated were emerging favorably  ii the uncertain cost of administering claims lae in the reformed california system  iii the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of the california reforms  iv the rapid growth in the volume of our business in california  v the limited but growing historical experience of ecic to use as a base for projecting future loss development  and vi the degree of movement observed in eicn s prior years projections of losses and lae in nevada following continued premium and market share reductions 
management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each of these sources of uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for unpaid losses and lae that  in management s opinion  represented a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  in light of the historical data  the actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  current facts and circumstances  and the sources of uncertainty identified by management 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december  fell within the consulting actuary s range of estimates 
the increase in management s best estimate relative to the consulting actuary s point estimate from december  to december  increased losses and lae expense incurred by million for the year ended december the table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for net unpaid losses and lae and our carried reserves at the dates shown as of december  in thousands low end of actuarial range carried reserves high end of actuarial range loss reserves are our estimates at a given point in time of our ultimate liability for the cost of claims and the cost of managing those claims  and are inherently uncertain 
it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future claim emergence and payment patterns and estimates of future trends in claim frequency and claim cost 
these estimates assume that the claim emergence and payment patterns  claim inflation and claim frequency trend assumptions implicitly built into our selected loss reserve will continue into the future 
unexpected changes in claim cost inflation can occur through changes in general inflationary trends  changes in medical technology and procedures  changes in wage levels and general economic conditions and changes in legal theories of compensability of injured workers and their dependents 
furthermore  future costs can be influenced by changes in workers compensation statutory benefit structure  and benefit administration and delivery 
in applying actuarial techniques  judgment is required to determine the relevance of historical claim emergence and payment patterns and other historical data  external industry benchmark data  information about current economic conditions such as inflation  and recent changes in environmental conditions such as legislation as well as company operational changes in selecting parameters for those techniques under current facts and circumstances 
judgment also is required in selecting from among the loss indications produced by the several actuarial techniques that are used 
from evaluation to evaluation  it often is appropriate to adjust the various methods and parameters used in the projection of losses to reflect the expected or estimated effect of such factors 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
estimates of ultimate losses and lae may change from one balance sheet date to the next when actual claim payment or individual case reserve estimates between those dates differ from the expected claim activity underlying the prior loss reserve estimate  and when actual lae expenditures differ from expected expenditure levels underlying the prior lae reserve estimate 
as actual losses and lae expenditures occur during a calendar period  they replace the portion of prior estimates of unpaid losses and lae that relate to that period 
in addition  the parameters used in the various methods and the relative weight accorded to the results of the different actuarial methods  all of which require judgment  may change as a result of observing that the actual pattern of expenditures differs from prior expectations  as well as based on new industry wide data and benchmarks derived from that data  when available 
the parameters and weights used in estimating ultimate losses may also change when external conditions such as the statutory benefit structures or the manner in which it is being interpreted and administered  or inflation differ from expectations underlying the prior estimate of ultimate losses  and when the effects of factors related to internal operations differ from expectations underlying the prior estimate of ultimate losses 
each of the actuarial methods used in the analysis and estimation of unpaid losses and lae depend in part on the selection of an expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  and the assumption that this expected pattern will prevail into the future 
we select relevant patterns as part of the periodic review and projection of unpaid losses and lae 
in selecting these patterns  we examine  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  benchmarks based on industry data and forecasts made by industry rate bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed 
management judgment is required in selecting the amount of the loss reserve to record on our consolidated financial statements 
management reviews the various actuarial projections  the assumptions underlying those projections  the range of indications produced by the actuarial methods and the actual long term and recent emergence and payment of claims 
management also considers the environmental conditions in which the insurance subsidiaries are doing business 
in addition  management considers the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimates based on the degree of change that has occurred or is occurring in the environment and in operations 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves on a gaap basis december  in thousands unpaid losses and lae  gross of reinsurance  at beginning of period less reinsurance recoverable  excluding bad debt allowance  on unpaid losses and lae net unpaid losses and lae at beginning of period losses and lae  net of reinsurance  acquired in business combination losses and lae  net of reinsurance  incurred in current year prior years total net losses and lae incurred during the period deduct payments for losses and lae  net of reinsurance  related to current year prior years total net payments for losses and lae during the period ending unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance reinsurance recoverable  excluding bad debt allowance on unpaid losses and lae unpaid losses and lae  gross of reinsurance  at end of period estimates of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years decreased due to continued favorable development in such prior accident years actual losses and lae paid and current projections of unpaid losses and lae were less than we originally anticipated 
the reduction in the liability for unpaid losses and lae was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the major sources of this favorable development include a actual paid losses  which have been less than expected and b the impact of new information on selected patterns of claims emergence and claim payment used in the projection of future loss payment 
in california  in particular  where our operations began on july   the actuaries and management s initial expectations of the ultimate level of losses and patterns of loss emergence and loss payment necessarily were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in california 
prior to july   no historical data from our california insurance subsidiary existed and  although some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in california  that data was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available 
the industry based benchmarks were adjusted judgmentally for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes  specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in california 
the actual emergence and payment of claims by our california insurance subsidiary has been more favorable than those initial expectations  due at least in part  we believe  to the impact of enactment of the major changes in the california environment 
other insurance companies writing california workers compensation insurance have also experienced emergence and payment of claims more favorable than anticipated 
at each evaluation date  the projected claim activity underlying the prior loss reserves has been replaced by the actual claim activity  and the expectation of future emergence and payment of california claims underlying the actuarial projections has been reevaluated periodically based both on our insurance subsidiaries emerging experience and on updating the benchmarks that are derived from observing and analyzing the insurance industry data for california workers compensation 
in nevada  we have compiled a lengthy history of workers compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the fund and eicn  but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long term history in nevada with the fund 
the expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long term and short term historical data 
in recent evaluations  claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short term historical data 
consequently  our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years 
also  at each evaluation date  the projected claim payments underlying the prior loss reserves were replaced by the actual claim payment activity that occurred during the calendar year 
the estimate of the future cost of handling claims  or lae  depends primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amount that has been spent on lae historically  as compared with the dollar volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical periods 
for our insurance subsidiaries business in nevada  as a result of operational improvements  including reductions in staff count to align with the current and anticipated volume of business in the state  our expenditures on lae in recent years have been lower than historical levels 
as these operational improvements impacted the actual emerging lae expenditures  the estimates of future lae have reduced 
for our insurance subsidiaries operations in california  initial expectations of lae when operations commenced in california were based on the assumptions used by the company in pricing the california business  and on some limited historical data for the market segments the company was entering 
as the company s operations in california have matured  and as data relating to the company s and industry claim handling expenses reflective of the new workers compensation benefit environment in california have become available  the expectations of lae underlying the projection of future lae have been adjusted to reflect that actual costs of administering claims relative to the cost of losses themselves have been greater than initial expectations 
although our revised lae expectations resulted in an increase in the projected future cost of administering california claims relative to losses at december   and  given the significant decrease in the estimated projected costs of losses in california  the overall impact has been a decrease in lae reserves 
we review our loss reserves each quarter and  as mentioned earlier  our consulting actuaries assist our review by performing a comprehensive actuarial analysis and projection of unpaid losses and lae twice each year 
we may adjust our reserves based on the results of our reviews and these adjustments could be significant 
if we change our estimates  these changes are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made 
our overall actual claims and lae experience and emergence in recent years has been more favorable than anticipated in prior evaluations 
our insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period of dramatically changing environmental conditions in our major markets  entry into new markets  and operational changes 
during periods characterized by such changes  at each evaluation  the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long term historical and recent company data  external data  evaluations of environmental changes  and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and lae  the parameters to incorporate in those methods  and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications 
since the loss reserves are providing for claim payments that will emerge over many years  if management s projections and loss reserves were established in a manner that reacted quickly to each new emerging trend in the data or in the environment  there would be a high likelihood that future adjustments  perhaps significant in magnitude  would be required to correct for trends that turned out not to be persistent 
at each balance sheet evaluation  some losses and lae projection methods have produced indications above the loss reserve selected by management  and some losses and lae projection methods have produced indications lower than the loss reserve selected by management 
at each evaluation  management has given weight to new data  recent indications  and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management s expectation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes  as compared with long term claim payment  claim emergence  and claim cost inflation patterns 
as patterns and trends recur consistently over a period of quarters or years  management gives greater implicit weight to these recent patterns and trends in developing our future expectations 
in our view  in establishing loss reserves at each historical balance sheet date  we have used prudent judgment in balancing long term data and recent information 
it is likely that ultimate losses and lae will differ from the loss reserves recorded in our december  balance sheet 
actual losses and lae payments could be greater or less than our projections  perhaps significantly 
the following paragraphs discuss several potential sources of such deviations  and illustrate their potential magnitudes 
in recent years  emerging claims costs and claim emergence and payment patterns have improved dramatically 
the largest driver of this improvement has been california reform 
as we observe continuing improvement in development  we have given significant weight to this emerging trend in projecting and selecting estimated ultimate losses and lae 
the amount of weight to allocate between the emerging trend and historical benchmark patterns is judgmental 
recent data points from our business in california  as well as from insurance industry experience for california workers compensation  indicate emergence patterns even more favorable than those implicitly underlying our loss reserves 
if future emergence matches those more favorable patterns  our current loss reserves could develop favorably over time 
if future claims emergence more closely resembles long term historical industry patterns  then our current loss reserves could develop unfavorably over time 
in nevada  we have seen a significant improvement in claims emergence and claims payment patterns in recent years  and have given these improved patterns significant weight in establishing loss reserves for our nevada business 
if future emergence in nevada more closely resembles long term historical patterns of the predecessor fund  then our current loss reserves could develop unfavorably over time 
for loss adjustment expense  particularly in nevada  our projections assume a long term cost of managing claims that is greater than the recent levels of lae produced by our insurance subsidiaries current operating model  but is less than the levels of lae expended in past years by our insurance subsidiaries and by the fund 
future changes in claims operations  while not currently planned or contemplated  could result in future actual lae and future projections of lae that may differ from current estimates 
some of the actuarial projection methods also rely on a selection of claim cost inflation rates 
if actual claim cost inflation differs from expectations underlying prior selections  or as environmental conditions in the states in which we do business or in the economy generally change  we will reevaluate and may change the selected claim cost inflation rate in future analyses 
such a change in assumptions would cause the results of some of the actuarial methods to change from one evaluation to the next 
the ultimate cost of our claims will depend in part on actual inflation rates in future years  which may differ from the inflation expectations implicit in our loss reserves 
more than of our claims payments during the three years ended december  related to medical care for injured workers 
the utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers compensation 
we are not able to state the rate of medical cost inflation that is assumed in our loss reserves because our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods that do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates  as well as methods that do 
however  because medical care will be provided over many years  and in some cases decades  to the injured workers who have open claims  the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments 
for example  if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at december   we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of the current claims would increase by approximately million on a net of reinsurance basis 
our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims and assume we will not be subject to losses from significant new legal liability theories 
while it is not possible to predict the impact of changes in this environment  if expanded legal theories of liability emerge  our ibnr claims may differ substantially from our ibnr reserves 
our reserve estimates assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment 
the impact of potential changes in the regulatory or legislative environment is difficult to quantify in the absence of specific  significant new regulation or legislation 
in the event of significant new regulation or legislation  we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business 
the range of potential variation of actual ultimate losses and lae from our current reserve for unpaid losses and lae is difficult to estimate because of the significant environmental changes in our markets  particularly california and florida  and because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in our markets outside nevada and florida 
the range of estimates of unpaid losses and lae produced by the actuarial reviews of the impact of medical cost inflation provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and lae payments 
if the actual unpaid losses and lae were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range  the impact on our financial results would be as follows december  in thousands increase decrease in reserves at low end of range at high end of range increase decrease in equity and net income  net of income tax effect at low end of range at high end of range however  the actuarial range represents an estimated range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses and lae will fall  based on the actuarial review of the results of the various methodologies and parameters used by the actuaries in the projection of losses and lae 
each different actuarial method may produce a different indication of unpaid losses and lae because each method relies in different ways on assumptions about the future 
for example  the loss development methods are based on an assumption that the selected pattern of emergence or payout of claims will recur in the future 
the frequency severity method is based on an assumption that the most recent year s ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated by inflation adjusting other accident years average cost per claim and by extrapolating based on historical patterns the per claim cost observed to date for the accident year 
the initial expected loss method assumes that the ultimate losses can be estimated based on the payroll of workers insured by us and a benchmark loss cost per payroll or as a percentage of premium 
the bornhuetter ferguson methods rely on a combination of these assumptions 
actual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or methodology can represent  and each actuarial methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics 
each different actuarial methodology may produce different indications of unpaid losses and lae 
none of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods 
nonetheless  at any given evaluation date  some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside this range  and the selection of reasonable alternative methods or reasonable alternative parameters in the actuarial projection process would produce an even wider range of potential outcomes  both above and below the range shown 
accordingly  we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes 
the magnitude of adjustments to prior years reserves for unpaid losses and lae reserves that we have made at december   and  decreases of million  million  and million respectively  also illustrate that changes in estimates of unpaid losses and lae can be significant from year to year 
we do not have a basis for anticipating that actual future payments of losses and lae are more likely to be either greater than or less than the reserve for unpaid losses and lae on our current balance sheet 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent a amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  b amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses  and c amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr for losses and lae 
these recoverables  by necessity  are based upon our current estimates of the underlying losses and lae  and are reported on our consolidated balance sheet separately as assets  as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders 
we bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid losses and lae remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them  or they might delay payment 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we continually monitor the financial condition and rating agency ratings of our reinsurers 
we require reinsurers that are not admitted reinsurers in california  florida or nevada to collateralize their share of the unearned premiums and unpaid loss reserves in order that our insurance subsidiaries receive credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements 
since our inception in  no material amounts due from reinsurers have been written off as uncollectible and  based on this experience  we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly require no material prospective adjustment 
under the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
as of december   the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were approximately million 
losses and lae paid with respect to the lpt agreement totaled approximately million at december  we account for the lpt agreement in accordance with fas  accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short term and long duration contracts  and as retroactive reinsurance 
upon entry into the lpt agreement  a deferred reinsurance gain was recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
this gain is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
in addition  we are entitled to receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
the contingent commission is estimated based on both actual results to date and projections of expected ultimate losses under the lpt agreement 
increases and decreases in the estimated contingent commission are reflected in our commission expense in the year that the estimate is revised 
recognition of premium revenue all premium revenue is recognized over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
the insurance premiums we charge are billed to our policyholders either annually or under various installment plans based on the estimated annual premium under the policy terms 
at the end of the policy term  payroll based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year 
earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums 
estimates of future audit premiums are based on our historical experience 
these estimates are subject to changes in policyholders payrolls  economic conditions and seasonality 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are included in current operations 
since our inception in  there have been no material adjustments of our accrual for earned but unbilled premium and  based on this experience  and  although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly require no material prospective adjustment 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  recognizing the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a tax rate change impacts our net income or loss in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 
our income tax returns are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and various state tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
although we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
in assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin  effective january  as of december   the company had recorded  as a liability for tax contingencies  million including interest of million 
as a result  the adoption of fin did not result in any change in the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit 
further  we elected to continue to record both interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
during  we reversed million of the liability including million in interest as certain statutory periods expired 
in the remaining balance was reversed million including million in interest and the liability was eliminated 
in  when the liability was initially recorded  the result was an increase in tax expense and our effective tax rate 
in and  as the liability was reversed  the impact was a decrease in tax expense and our effective tax rate 
valuation of investments our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of equity  net of deferred taxes as a component of net accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized in operations on the specific identification basis 
impairment of investment securities 
impairment of an investment security results in a reduction of the carrying value of the security and the realization of a loss when the fair value of the security declines below our cost or amortized cost  as applicable  for the security and the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
we consider various factors in determining if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary 
some of the factors we consider include how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  our intent and ability to keep the security for a sufficient time period for it to recover its value or reach maturity  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments 
the amount of any write downs is determined by the difference between cost or amortized cost of the investment and its fair value at the time the other than temporary decline was identified 
measurement of results we evaluate our operations by using the following key measures gross premiums written 
gross premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums written and assumed premiums written before the effect of ceded reinsurance 
direct premiums written represent the premiums on all policies our insurance subsidiaries have issued during the year 
assumed premiums written represent the premiums that our insurance subsidiaries have received from an authorized state mandated pool 
we use gross premiums written  which excludes the impact of premiums ceded to reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period 
net premiums written 
net premiums written is the sum of direct premiums written and assumed premiums written less ceded premiums written 
ceded premiums written is the portion of direct premiums written that we cede to our reinsurers under our reinsurance contracts 
we use net premiums written  primarily in relation to gross premiums written  to measure the amount of business retained after cession to reinsurers 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned represents that portion of net premiums written equal to the expired portion of the time for which insurance protection was provided during the financial year and is recognized as revenue 
net premiums earned are used to calculate the losses and lae  underwriting and other operating expenses and combined ratios  as indicated below 
losses and lae ratio 
the losses and lae ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of losses and lae to net premiums earned 
like many insurance companies  we analyze our losses and lae ratios on a calendar year basis and on an accident year basis 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and lae incurred during the calendar year  regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred  by the net premiums earned during that calendar year 
the calendar year losses and lae ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and lae established for insured events occurring in the current and prior periods 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
an accident year losses and lae ratio  or losses and lae for insured events that occurred during a particular year divided by the premiums earned for the year  is calculated by dividing the losses and lae  regardless of when such losses and lae are incurred  for insured events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year 
an accident year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
an accident year losses and lae ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably  respectively  whereas the calendar year losses and lae ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods 
this is an operating ratio based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our gaap financial information 
we analyze our calendar year losses and lae ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and lae from all periods  including development whether favorable or unfavorable of reserves established in prior periods 
in contrast  we analyze our accident year losses and lae ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and lae from insured events occurring during that year 
while calendar year losses and lae ratios are useful in measuring our profitability  we believe that accident year losses and lae ratios are more meaningful in evaluating our underwriting performance for any particular year because an accident year losses and lae ratio better matches premium and loss information 
furthermore  accident year losses and lae ratios are not distorted by adjustments to reserves established for insured events that occurred in other periods  which may be influenced by factors that are not generally applicable to all years 
the losses and lae ratios provided in this report are calendar year losses and lae ratios  except where they are expressly identified as accident year losses and lae ratios 
commission expense ratio 
the commission expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of commission expense to net premiums earned and measures the effectiveness of compensating agents and brokers for the business we have underwritten 
underwriting and other operating expenses ratio 
the underwriting and other operating expenses ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of underwriting and other operating expenses to net premiums earned  and measures an insurance company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is a measure used in the property and casualty insurance business to show the profitability of an insurer s underwriting  and it represents the percentage of each premium dollar spent on claims and expenses 
the combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae ratio  the commission expense ratio and the underwriting and other operating expenses ratio 
the losses and lae ratio  commission expense ratio and underwriting and other operating expenses ratio express the relationship between losses and lae  commissions and underwriting and other operating expenses including policyholder dividends  respectively  to net premiums earned 
when the combined ratio is below  an insurance company experiences underwriting gain  meaning that claims payments  the cost of settling claims  commissions and underwriting expenses are less than premiums collected 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
companies with lower combined ratios than their peers generally experience greater profitability

deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
net income before impact of lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes and net income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits and consequently we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations

there is a corresponding change to the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses as well as the deferred reinsurance gain 
a cumulative adjustment to the amortization of the deferred gain is also then recognized in earnings so that the deferred reinsurance gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the lpt agreement

the primary factors that affected net income included a decline in net premiums earned  increased underwriting expenses related to the acquisition and increased realized losses due to other than temporary impairment otti in our investment portfolio 
the acquisition of amcomp resulted in a million dollar increase to our net income in the decrease in the effective tax rate partially offset the decline in net income

revenues net premiums earned for the year ended declined compared to the prior year 
excluding the amcomp acquisition  net premiums earned would have declined 
the decrease in premiums earned was primarily due to the decrease in gross premium written  resulting from lower rates  competitive pressures and changes in economic and business conditions 
in california  our largest market  our filed rates on new business and renewals for the year ended were lower than the year ended in  our average california policy size decreased compared to this decrease was partially offset by an overall increase in policy count of  including an increase in policy count in california 
the overall increase in policy count included  policies attributable to the amcomp acquisition 
the acquisition provided an additional million of net premium earned 
the decrease in the gross written premium was also offset by a reduction in ceded premiums 
net investment income remained relatively unchanged from the prior year

the decline in net premiums earned and agency incentive commissions resulted in a million reduction in commission expense  which was partially offset by a million favorable change in the lpt agreement contingent commission in underwriting and other operating expenses increased year over year 
the increase is comprised primarily of million in underwriting expenses resulting from the acquired operations of amcomp 
excluding the impact of the acquired operations of amcomp  underwriting expenses would have decreased million 
this decrease was the result of a reduction of million in premium taxes as a result of lower net premiums earned 
professional fees also decreased million due to one time consulting fees related to our sarbanes oxley act compliance and the conversion from a mutual insurance holding company to a stock company in these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in salaries and related benefits 
salary and benefit increases included annual salary increases  increased benefit costs for medical coverage and expenses related to the equity and incentive plans 
in  income taxes decreased million compared to the year ended december  this was due to a decrease in the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended december   to compared to for the same period in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a change of million for the final reversal of the liability for previously unrecognized tax benefit  including interest  and the reduction in reserves for periods prior to the privatization of the fund  which were tax exempt

deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
net income before impact of lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes and net income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits and consequently we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations

there is a corresponding change to the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses as well as the deferred reinsurance gain 
a cumulative adjustment to the amortization of the deferred gain is also then recognized in earnings so that the deferred reinsurance gain reflects the balance that would have existed had the revised reserves been recognized at the inception of the lpt agreement 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this report 
net income net income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  net income was primarily impacted by three items a a reduction in favorable losses and lae reserve adjustments related to prior years from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in  b realized gains of million in primarily related to the portfolio reallocation in the fourth quarter  and c the decrease in the effective tax rate to in as compared to in net income includes amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the lpt agreement  net income would have been million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
revenues net premiums earned decreased for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to premium rate decreases in california offset by an increase in total policy count 
the overall increase in policy count included a decline in policy count of in nevada as a result of our adherence to our underwriting guidelines and increased competitive pressures 
in california  our largest market  our filed rates on new business and renewals as of december  were lower than december   offset by a increase in policy count 
the average in force policy premium at december  decreased to  from  at december  net investment income increased million for the year ended december  the change was attributable to three factors a an increase in fixed maturity securities resulting from the reallocation of the company s investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of which increased our portfolio yield  b an increase in the invested assets  and c interest income generated by higher cash balances 
the pre tax yield on invested assets increased approximately million or approximately basis points to at december  as compared to at december  the increase in our invested assets resulted in additional investment income of million for the year ended december  the net proceeds from the ipo generated million interest income prior to distribution to eligible members and higher cash balances generated million of additional interest income 
realized gains on investments decreased million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a portfolio reallocation in the fourth quarter of the company evaluated its equity portfolio at that time and elected to reduce the amount allocated to equity securities from to the selected target of 
equity sales of million related to the portfolio reallocation generated realized gains of million in in  approximately million of fixed maturity securities were sold to fund our stock repurchase program which resulted in a realized loss of million 
there were no other bulk transactions involving the sale of securities in either or the remaining gains were primarily attributable to the sale of equity securities holdings  where the market value was influenced by the acquisitions or mergers of the companies issuing such securities 
in  these gains were offset by an other than temporary impairment of million 
expenses losses and lae increased million  or  for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  losses and lae were and of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and  respectively 
losses and lae were positively impacted by a large favorable prior accident year adjustment of million taken primarily in the third quarter of in recognition of favorable development related to california regulatory reforms 
in  the prior year favorable losses and lae development adjustment was million  a decrease of million when compared to as the impact of the california and regulatory reforms development become more known  it is expected that any continued adjustments due to favorable development attributable to the regulatory reforms will continue to moderate in amount 
current year losses and lae rate estimates were approximately lower in this improved loss and lae rate was applied to lower net earned premium in  which partially offset the decrease in favorable prior years development discussed above 
the table below reflects the losses and lae reserve adjustments for the periods specified year ended december  quarter ended december  in millions prior accident year favorable development commutation total accident year favorable development lpt amortization of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt reserve favorable change there was no adjustment in either period to the direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement

commission expense decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  commission expense was and of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and  respectively 
commission expense decreased approximately million due to the decrease in net earned premium and million related to a favorable change in the estimated lpt agreement contingent commission 
the decrease in was partially offset by a two percentage point increase in our commission rate on select policies incepting july and after  which resulted in increased commission expense of million 
underwriting and other operating expenses increased million  or for the year ended december  the increase is composed primarily of a million increase in salaries and benefits  with a related million increase in general operating expenses and a million increase in technology maintenance and depreciation 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in professional fees and a reduction of million in the premium related expenses of premium tax  bad debt and policyholder dividends 
the increase in salaries and benefits and related general operating expenses were due to the increased staffing to support business needs and to meet the demands of being a public company 
employee benefit increases include higher benefit costs for medical coverage  an increased k employer match  and a new equity and incentive plan 
the technology maintenance and depreciation increased as a result of implementing eaccess  our new underwriting system  on july  with a full year of depreciation taken in the decrease in professional fees was primarily due to the one time incurred expenses related to the conversion of million 
the remainder of the decrease in professional fees was due to the reduction in the use of consultants for strategic planning of million and post implementation work of million on the new underwriting system 
the decreases in professional fees were partially offset by a million increase in legal  audit and sox compliance fees related to being a public company 
income taxes decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in income taxes was primarily due to a million decrease in pre tax income and other tax items discussed below 
the effective tax rate for the twelve months ended december   was compared to for the same period in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to three factors a a decline of million in realized gains in  b an increase in the ratio of tax exempt interest and dividends to pre tax income resulting from the company s reallocation of its investment portfolio in the fourth quarter  and c the million reversal of a liability for previously unrecognized tax benefits  including related interest  in third quarter additionally  in there were non deductible expenses related to the conversion 
combined ratio the combined ratio increased percentage points for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the change in the combined ratio was primarily due to recognition of a larger favorable prior accident year losses and lae adjustment in as compared to and an increase in operating expenses in liquidity and capital resources operating cash and short term investments parent company 
we are a holding company and substantially all of our operations have historically been conducted through our insurance subsidiaries  eicn and ecic 
on october   we completed the acquisition of amcomp and  as a result  added two new insurance subsidiaries  epic and eac 
we require cash to pay any dividends to our stockholders  repurchase common stock  make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations and to fund our operating expenses 
dividend capacity 
the ability of ehi to fund its operations depends upon the surplus and earnings of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to ehi 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  see item business regulation financial  dividend and investment restrictions for a further discussion of the restrictions and requirements pertaining to the availability of additional dividends 
based on reported capital  surplus and dividends paid within the last months  the maximum dividends that may be paid by ecic  epic and eac in without prior approval by the respective state insurance regulator are million  million and million  respectively 
as a result of the approval of extraordinary dividends totaling million from special surplus by the nevada commissioner in  dividends paid by eicn in will require prior approval 
stock repurchases 
on february   the ehi board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of the company s shares of common stock through june  on february   the board of directors extended this program through december  shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices in the open market  subject to market conditions and other factors 
we suspended the share repurchase program in september  due to uncertainty in the capital and credit markets 
there can be no assurance that we will complete any repurchases of our common stock pursuant to the program in the future 
through december   we repurchased  shares of common stock at the average price  including commissions  of per share  for a total of approximately million 
on may   the ehi board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
the stock repurchase program was used to return value to our stockholders by reducing the number of shares outstanding 
we began repurchasing shares on the open market on may   and completed the stock repurchase program on october  a total of  shares of common stock were repurchased at an average price of per share 
bank line of credit 
on september   we entered into a second amendment to the amended credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association amended credit facility  previously amended on may   under which we borrowed million to facilitate the acquisition of amcomp and for general corporate purposes 
the amended credit facility provides us with a million line of credit through december   b million line of credit from january  through december   and c million line of credit from january  through march  amounts outstanding bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option a a fluctuating rate of above prime rate or b a fixed rate that is above the libor rate then in effect 
the amended credit facility is secured by fixed maturity securities that had a fair value of million at december  the amended credit facility contains customary non financial covenants and requires us to maintain million of cash and cash equivalents at all times at the holding company 
we are currently in compliance with all applicable covenants 
at december   the principal balance outstanding was million 
in connection with the borrowing  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for an interest rate of on million 
the remaining million bears interest at a fluctuating rate based on libor plus 
previously  we had no amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility 
operating subsidiaries 
the primary sources of cash for our insurance operating subsidiaries are funds generated from underwriting operations  investment income and maturities of investments 
our primary use of cash is to pay claims and operating expenses  to purchase investments  and the payment of dividends to the parent holding company as regulated by state insurance laws  item business regulation financial  dividend and investment restrictions 
our net cash flows are generally invested in marketable securities 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically over time in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
we closely monitor the duration of these investments and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available for the payment of claims 
as our investment strategy focuses on asset and liability durations  and not specific cash flows  asset sales may be required to satisfy obligations 
at december   our investment portfolio had an effective duration of with individual maturities extending out to years 
the availability of cash to pay claims comes from our disciplined underwriting and pricing standards and the purchase of reinsurance to protect us against severe claims and catastrophic events 
on july   we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through july  the reinsurance program consists of three agreements  one excess of loss agreement and two catastrophic loss agreements 
the reinsurance program provides coverage up to million per loss occurrence  subject to certain exclusions 
our loss retention for the program year beginning july   is million 
the coverage is subject to an aggregate loss cession limitation in the first layer million in excess of our million retention of million 
additionally  in the second through fifth layers of our reinsurance program  our ultimate net loss shall not exceed million for any one life  and we are permitted one reinstatement for each layer upon the payment of additional premium 
effective november   our newly acquired insurance subsidiaries were included in our reinsurance program 
we believe that our reinsurance program meets our needs and that we are sufficiently capitalized for the above described retention 
our insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has a risk based capital rbc standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net premiums written 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
as of december   the last date that we were required to update the annual rbc calculation  our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory surplus in excess of the prescribed rbc requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action 
prior to  we met our cash requirements and financed our growth principally from underwriting operations  asset maturities  and investment income 
the recent acquisition of amcomp in was funded through a combination of available cash and proceeds from our amended credit facility 
as of december   we had cash  short term investments and fixed maturity securities that will mature over the next months of approximately million 
we plan to repay million of the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility on or before each december  and additionally  we expect one time amcomp integration costs of approximately million in other capital expenditures may include such things as stock repurchases  future stockholder dividends  and support of our growth strategy 
we believe that our liquidity needs over the next months will be met with cash from operations  maturing investments and prudent use of our credit 
cash flows we monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels 
we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed 
the table below shows our recent net cash flows for the year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows for the years ended december  and the million decrease in net cash flow from operations for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  was primarily due to a decrease of million in premiums received  an increase of million in losses and lae paid and million in underwriting expenses paid 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in income taxes paid and a million decrease in commissions and premium taxes paid 
the decrease in underwriting expenses paid was related to the acquired operating expenses of amcomp 
investing activities resulted in net cash used of million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided of million in investing used million for the acquisition of amcomp 
this was partially offset by million of cash and cash equivalents received in the acquisition and lower net purchases of securities 
financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended compared to net cash used of million for in  the amended credit facility provided million that was primarily used to finance the acquisition of amcomp 
additionally  stock repurchases were reduced to million from million in this was offset by million cash provided by our ipo in cash flows for the years ended december  and cash and cash equivalents increased million to for the year ended december  the net cash changes were million decrease in operating activities  million increase in investing activities and million decrease in financing activities as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in net cash from operations was primarily due to a decrease of million in premiums received offset by a million decrease in incomes taxes paid 
the net investment purchases decreased as we reinvested our cash in financing activities in order to facilitate the repurchase of our common stock  to pay stockholder dividends  and to build cash to support our growth 
the majority of cash used by financing activities was used to repurchase million of our common stock and to pay stockholder dividends of million 
we completed our ipo and conversion from a mutual insurance company to a stock company on february  the cash proceeds from the ipo were approximately million  after deducting approximately million in underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately million in other expenses related to the ipo and the conversion 
we used approximately million of our net proceeds for required mandatory cash distributions to our eligible members  and approximately million was distributed to eligible members electing to receive cash in the conversion 
we retained approximately million of net proceeds from the ipo  which was used for repurchases of our common stock  payments of stockholder dividends and general corporate purposes 
investments as of december   the amortized cost of our investment portfolio was billion and the fair value was billion 
we employ an investment strategy that emphasizes asset quality and considers the durations of fixed maturity securities against anticipated claim payments and expenditures or other liabilities 
the amounts and types of our investments are governed by statutes and regulations in states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically over time in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and invest excess cash in securities with appropriate duration targets to balance against anticipated future claim payments 
at december   our investment portfolio  which is classified as available for sale  was made up almost entirely of investment grade fixed maturity securities whose fair values may fluctuate due to the latest interest rate changes 
we strive to limit interest rate risk by managing the duration of our fixed maturity securities 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of 
to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we strive to limit credit risk by investing in a fixed maturity securities portfolio that is heavily weighted toward short term to intermediate term investment grade securities rated a or better 
our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio shall be aa 
as of december   our fixed maturity securities portfolio had an average quality of aa  with approximately of the carrying value of our investment portfolio rated aa or better 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  changes in market prices of the equity securities we hold in our combined investment portfolio result in increases or decreases in our total assets 
in order to minimize our exposure to equity price risk  we invest primarily in equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and seek to diversify our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
our objective has been to reduce equity exposure as a percentage of our total portfolio by increasing our fixed maturity securities 
our investment strategy allows a maximum exposure of of our total combined investment portfolio in equity securities  with our current equity allocation at of the total portfolio at december  our equity position has fallen below our selected target of due to declining market valuations and the consolidation of the amcomp investment portfolio into ours 
our equity allocation at september   was above our selected target of  at of our total combined investment portfolio 
we evaluated our portfolio equity allocation during the fourth quarter of and elected to reduce the amount allocated to equity securities to the target level during that period 
this portfolio reallocation also increased the fixed maturity securities to of the total portfolio and reduced our exposure to market volatility 
the additional fixed maturity securities generated additional investment income in and  as compared to our investment strategy focuses on maximizing economic value through dynamic asset and liability management  subject to regulatory and rating agency constraints  at the consolidated and individual company level 
the asset allocation is reevaluated by the finance committee of the board of directors at a detailed level on a quarterly basis 
we employ conning as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by our board of directors 
in addition to the construction and management of the portfolio  we utilize investment advisory services of conning 
these services include investment accounting and company modeling using dynamic financial analysis dfa 
the dfa tool is utilized in developing a tailored set of portfolio targets and objectives  which in turn  is used in constructing an optimal portfolio 
prior to the acquisition  amcomp employed regions bank to act as its independent investment advisor 
regions bank followed amcomp s written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by amcomp s board of directors 
amcomp s investment portfolio consisted solely of fixed maturity securities 
the portfolio held no asset backed securities except for mortgage backed securities 
as of october   the date of the acquisition  the fair value of amcomp s investment portfolio was million 
subsequent to the acquisition  we consolidated the amcomp investment portfolio into ours  which is managed by conning

all securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below cost  historical and projected company financial performance and near term prospects of the issuer  the outlook for industry sectors  credit ratings and macro economic changes and our ability and intent to hold the security until its expected recovery or maturity 
for the year ended december   we recognized a total impairment of million in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of equity securities was impaired million as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in market value of these securities primarily due to market conditions 
our fixed maturity securities were impaired million due to the credit downgrades and increased credit risk of issuers in the financial services sector 
based on our review as described above  we believe that we have appropriately identified the declines in the fair values of our unrealized losses at december  and we determined that the remaining unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of the interest rate environment and not the credit quality of the issuers 
we also determined that the remaining unrealized losses on equity securities were not considered to be other than temporary due to the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuers 
we have the ability and intent to hold securities with unrealized losses for a sufficient amount of time for them to recover their values or reach maturity

additionally  certain reinsurance contracts require company funds to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities assumed by the company

as a result  our calculation of loss and lae reserve payments by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our reserving process  see critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
actual payments of losses and lae by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of losses and lae reserves vary from actual ultimate claims amounts as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns

we adopted fsp fas for the period ended september   and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk 
we currently have no exposure to foreign currency risk 
credit risk investments our fixed maturity securities portfolio is also exposed to credit risk  which we attempt to manage through issuer and industry diversification 
we regularly monitor our overall investment results and review compliance with our investment objectives and guidelines 
our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio  as well as restrictions on investments in fixed maturity securities of a single issuer 
as of december   all but one of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio were rated investment grade by the securities valuation office of the naic or by standard poor s  moody s or fitch 
reinsurance we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
although our reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have reinsured 
as a result  reinsurance agreements do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims to policyholders and we may not recover claims made to our reinsurers 
we address this credit risk by selecting reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better and by performing credit reviews on our reinsurers 
the am best ratings of our reinsurance carriers as of december  are set forth in this report under item business reinsurance 
interest rate risk credit facilities and third party surplus notes our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates applies to the interest expense of variable rate debt under our bank credit facility and our insurance subsidiaries surplus notes issued to unaffiliated third parties 
the interest rates we pay increases and decreases with changes to libor 
we have  and may continue to utilize  derivative products such as interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
investments our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed maturity securities  all of which were classified as available for sale as of december  the primary market risk exposure to our fixed maturity securities portfolio is interest rate risk  which we strive to limit by managing duration 
as of december   our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of 
interest rate risk includes the risk that a security s value will change due to a change in interest rates 
for example  the fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by instructing our investment manager to select fixed income investments consistent with our investment strategy 
to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we continually monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our liquidity obligations 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  we select a hypothetical change in market rates that reflects what we believe are reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any action that we may take to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed security maturities and short term investments 
for invested assets  we use modified duration modeling to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put  and interest rate reset features 
durations on tax exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  excluding accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the following table summarizes the estimated change in fair value on our fixed maturity securities including short term investments  valued at billion as of december   based on specific changes in interest rates changes in interest rates estimated increase decrease in fair value in thousands  except percentages basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point decline basis point decline the sensitivity analysis model produces a predicted pre tax loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million  or based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss amount reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of our fixed maturity securities and short term investments  which constituted approximately of our total invested assets as of december  with respect to investment income  the most significant assessment of the effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on investment income would be based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases fas  issued by the fasb  which requires amortization adjustments for mortgage backed securities 
the rates at which the mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities are prepaid  and therefore the average life of mortgage backed securities  can vary depending on changes in interest rates for example  mortgages are prepaid faster and the average life of mortgage backed securities falls when interest rates decline 
the adjustments for changes in amortization  which are based on revised average life assumptions  would have an impact on investment income if a significant portion of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at significant discounts or premiums to par value 
as of december   the par value of our mortgage backed securities holdings was million 
amortized cost is of par value 
since a majority of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at a premium or discount that is significant as a percentage of par  a fas adjustment could have a significant effect on investment income 
however  given the current economic conditions and prevailing interest rate environment  the rate of prepayments is unlikely to accelerate

equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio result in decreases in the value of our total assets

our estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses include assumptions about future payments for closure of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established  we will be required to increase reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses with a corresponding reduction in our earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
we consider inflation in the reserving process by reviewing cost trends and our historical reserving results 
additionally  an actuarial estimate of increased costs is considered in setting adequate rates  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded general inflation rates 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including payrolls  are impacted to a certain degree by the inflation rate
