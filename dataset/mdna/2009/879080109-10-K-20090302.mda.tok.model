item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding our commercial industrial activity 
we lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas  but do not ourselves engage in any such exploratory or extractive activities 
as of december   approximately  acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately  barrels of oil and  mcf of dry gas during our share of production  based upon average royalty rates during the last three years  has been   and  barrels of oil per day for   and  respectively 
approximately producing oil wells were located on the leased land as of december  royalty rates on our leases range from to 
estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us 
we do not make such estimates  and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us 
we have approximately  acres under lease to national cement company of california  inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
national owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a capacity of approximately  tons of cement per year 
the amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant which  declined in the decline in shipments is the direct result of reduced construction activity due to the depressed real estate market 
the term of this lease expires in  but national has options to extend the term for successive periods of and years 
proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process 
see item  legal proceedings  for a further discussion 
joint ventures we are also involved in three joint ventures  ta petro  five west parcel llc and tejon dermody llc 
ta petro owns and operates a acre travel and truck stop facility  and also operates three separate gas stations with convenience stores within tic west 
during  ta petro will begin and complete construction of a new travel plaza in tic east on acres 
five west parcel llc is a joint venture with rockefeller development group to construct and lease or sell a  square foot industrial building that was completed during february the building was leased on a month to month basis upon completion  but is currently vacant 
tejon dermody llc sold its primary asset during and the joint venture was dissolved in august we received the final equity distribution from this venture in january resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement and land stewardship activities 
we have two major resort residential communities within this segment that are progressing through the entitlement process 
the entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete 
the conservation agreement that we signed in is designed to minimize the opposition from environmental groups to these projects and eliminate or reduce the time spent 
table of contents in litigation once governmental approvals are received 
litigation by environmental groups has been a primary cause of delay and loss of financial value for real estate development projects in california 
centennial community the centennial development is a large master planned community development encompassing approximately  acres of our land within los angeles county 
upon completion of centennial  it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when complete  would create a substantial number of jobs 
centennial is being developed by centennial founders  llc  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest 
our partners in this joint venture are pardee homes  lewis investment company and standard pacific corp 
during  we contributed of the capital funds necessary to pursue entitlements and development efforts undertaken by this joint venture 
since the initial submittal of our administrative level environmental impact report  or eir  to los angeles county  we have continued to receive feedback from the los angeles planning department and have submitted several revisions of our administrative eir as we work towards the public filing of our eir and final approval 
we cannot estimate when this approval will be granted  but the process is being actively pursued 
in addition to the eir  we have submitted a variety of other reports required as part of the entitlement process including our specific plan  tentative tract maps  geological reports  traffic reports  and water supply assessment reports 
centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly and commercially viable development 
our plan is for a sustainable program that provides for the needs of the community while protecting the environment and will be achieved through our continuing focus on responsible use of limited resources and progressive construction design 
we recognize the need to balance expensive green program certifications with the practicality of investing those same funds in environmentally sound building elements 
tejon mountain village community in addition to the centennial community project  we are currently engaged in the development of tmv 
tmv is envisioned as an exclusive  very low density  resort based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities  lodging and spa facilities  world class golf facilities  a range of housing options  and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish tmv as the resort of choice for the southern california market 
tmv is being developed by tmv llc  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership interest 
our partner in this joint venture is dmb tmv llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dmb associates inc  or dmb  which is a leading resort recreational planned community developer 
under the joint venture agreement  the parties have agreed to secure all entitlements and all necessary regulatory approvals  to master plan  develop and sell parcels and homes to end users  and to develop and own  sell or joint venture commercial properties  hotels  and golf course sites in tmv 
in  the company contributed rights to all studies  research  and other work that we had performed related to tmv to the joint venture and committed to contribute  acres comprising the tmv site at such time as entitlements are successfully obtained and litigated  while dmb committed up to a total of at least  to fund entitlement efforts and development 
beginning in  based on the achievement of entitlement contribution levels 
table of contents by dmb  we will begin to share future funding requirements for entitlement and future development activities with dmb 
in late  the eir for tmv was submitted to kern county planning department 
the eir will undergo review by kern county and then will be available for public review and comment later in this phase of the entitlement process is a precursor to the eir being presented to the local government approval body  the kern county board of supervisors 
because our residential housing communities  centennial and tmv  are in the entitlement phase  they have not been directly impacted by the current downturn in the housing market or the credit crisis 
however  we cannot project the condition of the housing market or the stability of the mortgage industry at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases 
the sale and leasing of commercial industrial real estate is very competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around california 
the degree of competition has increased due to the current economic climate which has caused an oversupply of comparable real estate available for sale or lease due to the decline in demand as a result of the recession and lack of active business expansion 
our ability to attract tenants due to preferential pricing is minimized due to price cutting by our most direct regional competitors in the inland empire region of southern california and areas north of us in the san joaquin valley of california 
the greatest competition for the centennial community will come from california developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage wine grapes  almonds  and pistachios  we manage the farming of wheat on approximately acres and alfalfa and forage mix on acres in the antelope valley and we periodically lease acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices we receive for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through proven cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 
sales of our grape and pistachio crops typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year  while sales of our almond crop typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of the year  but can occur up to a year after the crop is harvested 
in  we sold of our grape crop to one winery  to a second winery and the remainder to three other customers 
these sales are under long term contracts ranging from two to fourteen years 
our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers  with the three largest buyers accounting for  and respectively of our almond revenues 
the majority of our pistachios were sold to two customers  with the larger customer purchasing 
table of contents approximately of the crop 
we do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of these large buyers because of the markets for these commodities  the large number of buyers that would be available to us  and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract 
nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
crop prices  especially almonds  are also adversely affected by a strong us dollar which makes us exports more expensive and decreases worldwide demand for us product 
the increase in the value of the dollar in along with the growing global recession has had a detrimental impact on almond prices and the demand for us almonds in overseas markets 
our water entitlement for available from the california state water project  or swp  when combined with supplemental water  was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources  or dwr  has announced its water supply at only of full entitlement 
this allocation alone is insufficient for our farming needs  however  combined with other water supplies that local water districts may be able to make available to its farmers  groundwater sources  water transfers from tejon castac water district  and water banking arrangements  we expect to have a level of water supply in that will meet all of our farming requirements 
water from these supplemental sources may be more expensive than water available from the swp because of pumping costs and transfer costs  but is expected to make up for the swp water shortfalls that we may experience during the coming year

item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves significant risk and could result in operating losses 
we are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial supply of similar product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
a prolonged recession in the national economy  or a further downturn in national or regional economic conditions  could continue to adversely impact our business 
the collapse of the housing market together with the crisis in the credit markets  have resulted in a recession in the national economy 
at such times  potential home buyer and commercial real estate customers often defer or avoid real estate transactions due the substantial costs involved and uncertainties in the economic environment 
our future real estate sales  revenues  financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result 
our business is especially sensitive to economic conditions in california  where all of our land is located 
there is no consensus as to when the recession will end  and california  as one of the hardest hit states  could take longer to recover than the rest of the nation 
a prolonged recession will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
higher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 

table of contents we are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals for our developments that could be denied 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
all of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations  so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied 
in addition  the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project 
in addition  many states  cities and counties including neighboring ventura county have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures 
if that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the company s land use  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
third party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
we are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications  or preclude development in specific areas 
in addition  in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously  so litigation challenging their approval is expected 
the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin  potential impacts of projects on the california condor and other species of concern  the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors  potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in los angeles county  and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being sprawl 
recent concerns over the impact of development on water availability and global warming increases the breadth of potential obstacles that our developments face 
until governmental entitlements are received  we will have a limited inventory of real estate 
each of our four current and planned real estate projects  tic west and east  centennial and tmv  involve obtaining various governmental permits and or entitlements 
a delay in obtaining 
table of contents governmental approvals could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users 
we are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
centennial ultimately would compete with other residential housing options in the region  such as developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects 
our developable land is concentrated entirely in california 
all of our developable land is in california and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within california  any adverse change in the economic climate of california  which is currently in a recession  or our region of that state  and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of california  or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
there is no consensus as to when the recession will end or how long it could take to recover from the recession 
ultimately  our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to pursue land development 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
our business model is very dependent on transactions with strategic partners 
we may not be able to successfully attract desirable strategic partners complete agreements with strategic partners and or manage relationships with strategic partners going forward  any of which could adversely affect our business 
for several years a key to our development and value creation strategies has been the use of joint ventures and strategic relationships 
these joint venture partners bring development experience  industry expertise  financial resources  financing capabilities  brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets 
a complicating factor in any joint venture is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors related to our business 
these competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan 
we may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation of the strategic partner deteriorates 
if we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners  our business could be adversely affected 
only a limited market exists for our common stock which could lead to price volatility 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 

table of contents concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of february   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  our lease portfolio is protected to some extent from inflation  since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in our leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation 
if the downturn in the real estate industry or the instability of the mortgage industry and commercial real estate financing continues  it could have an adverse effect on our real estate business 
our residential housing projects  centennial and tmv  are currently in the entitlement phase  and therefore they have not been impacted by the current downturn in the housing market or the mortgage lending crisis 
however  if the downturn in the housing market or the instability of the mortgage industry continues at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases  our resort residential business could be adversely affected 
excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in house prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available 
the inability of potential commercial industrial clients to get adequate financing for the expansion of their businesses could lead to reduced lease revenues and sales of land within our industrial development 
we may encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including natural risks  such as geological and soil problems  earthquakes  fire  heavy rains and flooding  and heavy winds  shortages of qualified trades people  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of certain materials

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties our  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
our corporate offices are located on our property 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan  or the general plan  for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the general plan is intended to provide general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to any amendment of the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies that contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing entitlements for the centennial master planned community on approximately  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain  much of which is not presently served by paved roads or by utility or water lines 
much of this property is included within the conservation agreement 
as we receive entitlement approvals over the life span of our developments we will dedicate conservation easements on  acres of this land  which will preclude future development of the land 
this acreage includes many of the most environmentally sensitive areas of our property and is home to many plant and wildlife species whose environments will remain undisturbed 
any significant development on our currently undeveloped land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species and wetlands issues  which may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays in order to obtain governmental approval 
water rights existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  or wheeler ridge  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the swp  to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the terms of these contracts extend to under the 
table of contents contracts  we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional water entitlement from the swp sufficient to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  or tejon castac  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in tic  has  acre feet of swp entitlement 
in addition  tejon castac has approximately  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tejon castac and our company 
tejon castac is the principal water supplier to tic  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tmv 
we have constructed a acre water bank consisting of nine ponds on our land in southern kern county 
water is pumped into these ponds and then percolates into underground aquifers 
since  we have purchased  acre feet of water from the antelope valley east kern water agency  or avek  which has been pumped from the california aqueduct and is currently retained in this water bank 
in and we contracted for  additional acre feet of water from avek  but have deferred delivery of the water to a future year 
we anticipate adding additional water to this storage facility in the future as water is available 
during  swp allocations were  and wheeler ridge was able to supply us with of our farming demands through supplemental water it provided principally from water banks 
in some years  there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the swp water 
both wheeler ridge and tejon castac are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
wheeler ridge expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the swp deliveries exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if swp deliveries are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then wheeler ridge may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfer from others  and water banking assets to supply the needs of our farming operations 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
also  as we develop our real estate for residential  commercial and industrial uses  there will be less water available for agriculture from tejon castac 
a preliminary allocation has been made by the dwr for the water contracts with wheeler ridge and with tejon castac require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the california state water project and each district  whether or not water is used or available 
wheeler ridge contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 
although no assurance has been given  the water agency serving the los angeles county portion of our land  avek  has indicated  based on water availability that it could provide a portion of the water needed for centennial 
portions of our property also have available groundwater 
that source would be sufficient to supply commercial development in the interstate corridor 
ground water in the antelope valley basin is the subject of litigation 
please refer to item  legal proceedings 

table of contents there have been many environmental challenges regarding the movement of state project water through the sacramento delta 
these challenges resulted in a temporary court ordered shut down of the delta pumps  which are of primary importance to the california water system because these pumps are part of the system that moves water from northern california to southern california 
after a temporary contingency pumping plan was approved by the court  which protects a certain species of fish  the court allowed the pumps to be turned back on but continued to limit usage 
a new biological opinion  or bo  issued by the us fish and wildlife service in december contains similar restrictions on pumping from the delta 
the restrictions from pre conditions are estimated to reduce swp deliveries about on average  or during dry conditions 
it is anticipated that the new bo will be challenged in the courts by both water agencies and environmental groups 
there are many groups  governmental and private  working together to develop a solution in the near future to alleviate the curtailment of water from the delta 
historic swp restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in  and the parties to a lawsuit challenging such removal have agreed to a settlement which would allow such removal to continue while the environmental impacts are studied 
for this purpose  municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or commercial industrial developments 
in the near term  for political and regulatory reasons  it is unlikely that we would be able to direct any of our wheeler ridge agricultural entitlement to municipal or industrial uses 
the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority community facilities district  or cfd  a joint powers authority formed by kern county and tejon castac  has placed liens on  acres of the company s land 
these liens are to secure payment of special taxes related to  of bond debt sold by the cfd 
the company is obligated  as a landowner in the district  to pay its share of the special taxes assessed each year 
the  acres of land includes tic west 
proceeds from the sale of cfd bonds are used to reimburse the company for public infrastructure related to tic west 
in  we did not receive any reimbursement from these bond funds 
in   and  we paid approximately   and  respectively  in special taxes related to the cfd 
as development continues to occur at tic  new owners of land and new lease tenants  through triple net leases  will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax 
as this happens  our obligation is reduced 
it is expected that we will have special tax payments in of approximately  but this could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding within the cfd and the amount of taxes paid by others 
as development and values increase around tic  we may be able to have approximately  acres released from the cfd lien 
item legal proceedings the company leases land to national cement company of california inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits on the leased acreage 
the california regional water quality control board  or rwqcb  for the lahontan region 
table of contents has issued several orders with respect to environmental conditions on the property currently leased to national groundwater plume of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds 
this order directs the company s former tenant  lafarge corporation  or lafarge  the current tenant national  and the company to  among other things  clean up groundwater contamination on the leased property

the company is advised that the cleanup is complete 
lafarge continues to monitor the groundwater 
diesel fuel 
an order of the rwqcb directs lafarge  national and the company to clean up contamination from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline 
the company is advised that lafarge and national have substantially completed the groundwater cleanup and that groundwater monitoring remains an on going activity 
to date  the company is not aware of any failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders or informal requests of the rwqcb 
under current and prior leases  national and lafarge are obligated to indemnify the company for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of their use of the leased premises 
the company believes that all of the matters described above are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations and that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
if they do not and the company is required to perform the work at its own cost  it is unlikely that the amount of any such expenditure by the company would be material 
on november   a complaint was filed asking for the antelope valley ground water basin to be adjudicated 
this means that the rights of all parties overlying the basin  including the company s land  should be fixed based on various principles of water law and on negotiations among the principal parties or groups of water users 
because the case is still in the early stages and not yet at issue  it is too early to ascertain what effect  if any  this case may have on the centennial project or the company s remaining lands in the antelope valley 
because the water supply plan for the centennial project includes several sources of water in addition to ground water underlying the company s lands  and because the creation of an efficient market for local water rights is frequently an outcome of adjudication proceedings  we anticipate that sufficient water to supply the centennial project s needs will continue to be available for its use

we are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing  employment  and lifestyle needs of californians and to create value for our shareholders 
in support of these objectives  we have been investing in land planning and entitlement activities for new industrial and residential land developments and in infrastructure improvements within our active industrial development 
our prime asset is approximately  acres of contiguous  largely undeveloped land that  at its most southerly border  is miles north of los angeles and  at its most northerly border  is miles east of bakersfield 
our business model is designed to create value through the entitlement and development of land for commercial industrial and resort residential uses while at the same time protecting significant portions of our land for conservation purposes 
we operate our business near one of the country s largest population centers  which is expected to continue to grow well into the future 
we currently operate in three business segments commercial industrial real estate development and services  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
commercial industrial real estate development and services generates revenues from building  grazing  and land lease activities  land and building sales  oil and mineral royalties and ancillary land management activities 
the primary commercial industrial development is tic 
resort residential land development does not currently produce revenues but is actively involved in the land entitlement process internally and through joint venture entities 
within our resort residential segment  the two active developments are tmv and the centennial master planned community 
farming produces revenues from the sale of grapes  almonds  and pistachios 
the conservation agreement entered into with five of the major environmental organizations in june calls for the permanent protection of up to  acres of our land through phased dedicated conservation easements on approximately  acres of our land   acres of open space within permitted project areas  and an option for these groups to purchase conservation easements on an additional  acres of our land 
the optional purchase of the conservation easements must occur during a specified timeframe  and the lapse of that period of time without the execution of the purchase of all or some of the conservation easements will result in that land becoming available for future development 
the conservation agreement provides certainty for us and the environmental resource groups 
for tejon  the agreement provides certainty that our existing development plans will not be opposed by the environmental resource groups that are party to the agreement  and that we will be able to continue to protect our land while still engaging in current revenue producing activities  including farming  ranching  and oil and mineral extraction activities 
for the environmental groups the agreement provides certainty that the ecological resources on our 
table of contents lands will be permanently protected 
we believe the conservation agreement is a significant step toward advancing the successful entitlement for our projects 
for we had net income of  compared to net income of  in  a decline of 
the decline in net income resulted from increased commercial industrial revenues being more than offset by decreased farming revenues  increased expenses  and a decline in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
in  revenues from operations grew  to  when compared to expenses from operations increased  in to  compared to the prior year largely due to cost of sales of land 
the growth in commercial revenues of  resulted primarily from sales of developed and undeveloped land  when compared to we also experienced increases in oil royalties and improved base and percentage rents from our power plant lease with calpine 
the decrease in our farming revenues was primarily due to decreased yields on our pistachio crop  the absence of walnut revenue  as our walnut crop was our final harvest of walnuts  and a decline in prices for our almond crop 
the large decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was the result of the sale of the industrial building owned by our tejon dermody joint venture in the building was sold in july  resulting in a gain of  before tax  of which we recognized  and which is included as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures in the results 
corporate expenses remained consistent in while resort residential expenses increased in compared to due to additional employees hired in late for  we had net income of  compared to a net loss of  for revenues from operations for grew  to  expenses from operations for were  a decrease of  when compared to the growth in revenues was due to improvements in both base and percentage rents from our power plant lease with calpine  increased revenues from ancillary land use activities  and improved farming revenues due to the higher pistachio and walnut crop production 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures improved  due to the gain on the sale of a commercial building by the tejon dermody joint venture 
a decline in corporate expenses due to the absence of milestone stock compensation expense added to the improved operating results 
during  we will continue to invest funds in our joint ventures and internally toward the achievement of entitlements for our land and for infrastructure development within our active industrial developments 
the process of securing entitlements for our land is a long  arduous process which could take several years 
the conservation agreement is designed to help minimize future legal delays that are often a part of this process 
during the next few years  our net income will fluctuate from year to year based upon commodity prices  production within our farming segment  and the timing of sales of land and the leasing of land within our industrial developments 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative discussion of our results of operations 
it contains the results of operations for each operating segment of the business and is followed by a discussion of our financial position 
it is useful to read the business segment information in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimates that are likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  stock compensation  our future ability to utilize deferred tax assets  and defined benefit retirement plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from lease revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease unless there is a considerable risk as to collectability 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
lease revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
royalty revenues are contractually defined as to the percentage of royalty and are tied to production and market prices 
our royalty arrangements generally require payment on a monthly basis with the payment based on the previous month s activity 
we accrue monthly royalty revenues based upon estimates and adjust to actual as we receive payments 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  to record these sales 
sfas no 
provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  sfas no 
requires a land sale to be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold  or be required to develop the property in the future or construct facilities or off site improvements 

table of contents in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we fully recognized the revenues from all land sales in as none of the requirements for deferral of revenue were present 
in  we recognized  of deferred land sale revenues based on the completion of contractual construction obligations 
at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues and any related inventoried costs are expensed  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
it is not unusual for portions of our almond crop to be sold in the year following the harvest 
orchard almond and pistachio revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 
for the orchard crops  we estimated almond revenue to be  or per pound on average  and pistachio revenue to be  or per pound on average 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years  prices received on almonds have ranged from 
to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have ranged from to per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were from the midpoint 
as an example  the range for almonds in was to per pound 
if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimated range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
actual final orchard crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue by   and  in  and  respectively 
the large adjustment in was due to bonus payments received on pistachios of  continuing price increases for almonds also contributed  to the adjustment 
the adjustments in previous years were related to increases in almond  pistachio and walnut prices prior to the receipt of our final scheduled payments 
capitalization of cost the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land sales and leases when we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to 
table of contents the total project  we follow sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land  we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market and costs of construction change 
in preparing these estimates  we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward  due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
during and  per square foot of cost was allocated to sold and leased land as a cost of development at tic west 
cost for land within tic east is currently estimated at per square foot 
any increases to this estimate in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will become even more significant as we continue to move forward as a real estate development company 
the estimates used are very susceptible to change from period to period  due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of project completion  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
the impairment calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted 
we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
we currently operate in three segments  commercial industrial real estate development  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
at this time  there are no assets within either of our real estate segments or our farming segment that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to 
table of contents changes in prices  absorption  production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 
in estimating future prices  absorption  production  and costs  we use our internal forecasts and business plans 
we develop our forecasts based on recent sales data  historical absorption and production data  input from marketing consultants  as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers and potential purchasers of our farming products 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
the estimation of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities requires that we make use of estimates of present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates  salary growth  retirement rates  expected contributions  inflation  expected return on plan assets  and mortality rates the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s domestic plans consisted of a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
if we were to assume a basis point change in the discount rate used  our periodic pension cost would change approximately  and our projected benefit obligation would change approximately  stock based compensation we apply the recognition and measurement principles of sfas no 
r  share based payments in accounting for long term stock based incentive plans 
our stock based compensation plans have historically included both stock options and stock grants 

table of contents we have not issued any stock options to employees or directors since january  and our financial statements do not reflect any compensation expenses for stock options 
all of our stock options are fully vested and all related expenses were recognized in prior year financial statements per gaap 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common stock and stock option information  for additional information regarding stock options 
we also make stock awards to employees based upon time based criteria and through the achievement of performance related objectives 
performance related objectives are either stratified into threshold  target  and maximum goals or based on the achievement of a milestone event 
these stock awards are currently being expensed over the expected vesting period based on each performance criterion 
we make estimates as to the number of shares that will actually be granted based upon estimated ranges of success in meeting the defined performance measures 
if our estimates of performance shares vesting were to change by  stock compensation expense would increase or decrease by  depending on whether the change in estimate increased or decreased shares vesting 
during  based on current estimates of future operating results and cash flow projections  we reversed  of stock compensation expenses that had been recorded in prior years operating results because it is no longer likely that these shares will vest 
we also adjusted future expenses for other stock awards based on our current estimates of future results

it also establishes disclosure requirements that allow financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we have reviewed statement r  and we do not expect that this pronouncement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or statement  was issued in december statement is designed to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of consolidated financial statements that include a noncontrolling interest  more commonly known as a minority interest 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards that address the proper presentation in the financial statements of ownership interest  share of income  changes in ownership and required disclosure upon deconsolidation 
statement applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements  but will only affect those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries 
although we prepare consolidated financial statements  we currently have no outstanding noncontrolling interests 
therefore  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or our financial condition 
statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  results of operations by segment we evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results 
each segment is subject to review and evaluation as we monitor current market conditions  market opportunities  and available resources 
the performance of each segment is discussed below real estate commercial industrial our commercial industrial segment profits during increased to  an  improvement  or  when compared to segment profits 
this increase in segment profits was driven by the higher margins achieved on land sales in compared to  and the increased royalties received on oil leases as oil production and prices reached record highs in land sale margins improved  in on the sale of developed and undeveloped land 
two sales of developed land for a total of acres within tic west were completed with proceeds of  in  with one sale to an industrial warehouse developer and one to a 
table of contents hotel developer 
sales of  acres of undeveloped land with proceeds of  were also completed during oil and mineral royalty margins increased  overall  with oil royalties increasing by  while cement  sand and rock royalties decreased  oil production in increased  barrels over production while prices increased per barrel on average over the prior year 
mineral royalties declined as the demand for rock aggregate decreased reflecting the drop in the construction industry during a decline in ancillary land use revenues of  and increased commercial water costs of  offset some of the revenue increases described above 
additional increases in legal costs related to the land sales  insurance costs  fuel  and materials and supplies were offset by decreases in compensation costs as previously expensed stock performance awards were reversed based on revised estimates 
we expect the continued global and california recessions to have a negative impact on commercial industrial revenues in through decreased leasing and sales 
the recession in the real estate industry is causing a lack of demand for new construction  and sales and leasing of industrial products 
the declining price of oil over the last few months will also negatively impact our revenues during in  we began infrastructure improvements at tic east 
these infrastructure improvements set the stage for a new ta petro travel plaza that will be constructed during in we will focus on the marketing and development of tic west and east 
in early we received final approval on our ftz application from the us foreign trade zone board 
approval of our application for acres of land at tic was delayed due to us customs and border protection issues related to resource management and jurisdictional oversight 
during december  the tenant under our power plant lease  calpine  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
on june   we received notification that the bankruptcy court had affirmed the power plant lease as part of the bankruptcy reorganization 
on january   calpine emerged from its bankruptcy reorganization 
based on past operating history and calpine s emergence from bankruptcy  we do not expect any changes in our business relationship with calpine that would negatively impact future operating revenues 
our marketing efforts for tic east and west continue to focus on educating potential users about the logistical benefits of our site and the success that current tenants and owners within our development have experienced 
we believe california s long term projected population growth will help to drive increases in industrial activity at tic once the economic environment improves 
our development strategy has fit very well with the logistics model that companies have been using  which favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size provides us with a potential marketing advantage 
a potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the port of los angeles in comparison to the traditional warehouse distribution centers east of los angeles 
the current downturn in the economy is also having an adverse impact on our ability to sell or lease our industrial commercial product 
the sharp downturn in economic activity over the last year has resulted in a marked decrease in potential tenant interest in recent months 
contraction of business operations has resulted in price cutting and significant increases in available warehouse space in the inland empire and other los angeles metropolitan areas 
this increased competition could negatively impact our pricing advantages  and the lack of corporate business expansion due to 
table of contents future economic uncertainties will also decrease demand for our buildings and land in the near term 
the commercial industrial segment will continue to experience increases in costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of development is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the market 
infrastructure development and marketing activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial and industrial properties 
our commercial industrial segment profits during decreased  or  when compared to segment profits 
the decline in segment profits was driven by an increase in expenses of  that more than offset the  increase in revenues 
the most significant increases in expenses were in compensation costs due to additional staff 
we also experienced increased contract and professional service costs related to the issuance of community facilities district bonds  or cfd bonds  for tic west  legal costs related to a pending land sale  and costs related to a lease and updated operating agreements with travelcenters of america 
property taxes increased due to higher special tax assessments related to outstanding cfd bonds 
increases in many routine operating costs such as fuel  utilities and repairs were driven by underlying higher petroleum prices since many of these items are produced using petroleum derived products 
water costs also increased in this segment due to higher water costs within the local water district 
these increased expenses were partially offset by improved revenues 
in  we completed the construction commitments required by our land sales agreements with in n out and ta petro 
completion of these improvements resulted in recognition of the remaining  of revenues relating to these sales 
in we recognized  of this sales revenue 
improvements from both base and percentage rents from our power plant lease with calpine accounted for an increase in revenues of  revenues received from ancillary land use activities increased  partially offsetting these increases was a net decline of  in mineral revenues due to decreased production of sand rock mined by our lessee and from our tenant s planned facility maintenance 
see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
real estate resort residential our resort residential segment activities include land planning and entitlement activities related to our potential residential developments  which include the centennial master planned community and tmv 
each of our resort residential projects is being developed through a joint venture in which the company is a partner 
such joint venture agreements provide a source of capital and allow the significant costs and business risks inherent in these projects to be shared with our venture partners 
during  we signed a conservation agreement with five major environmental organizations 
the organizations that signed the conservation agreement will not oppose our current residential developments 
these developments will continue to be subject to 
table of contents the regulatory requirements that are a part of the entitlement process and could be opposed by other parties 
however  we believe the conservation agreement will be beneficial in reducing future legal opposition and delays 
the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  in  an increase of  or when compared to the prior year 
as this segment does not yet generate revenues  the increased loss was the result of an increase in expenses as compared to the primary driver behind this increase was  of additional compensation costs including salary and stock compensation net of amounts capitalized for staff hired in late to oversee and manage our interest in our residential joint venture projects and to assist in implementing the conservation agreement 
we believe our current staffing levels will be adequate to supply the necessary oversight required in while performing the contractual requirements included within the conservation agreement 
near term activities within this segment will be focused on obtaining entitlements for the centennial project  located in los angeles county  tmv  located in kern county  and stewardship activities 
the resort residential segment will continue to experience increases in costs in the future related to professional service fees  public relations costs  and staffing costs as we continue the entitlement process for the above communities and implement the conservation agreement 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and the possibility of litigation upon approval of our entitlements in the future 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best use for our land holdings 
our long term goal through this process is to increase the value of our land and create future revenue opportunities through resort and residential development 
the conservation agreement also provides for the sale of conservation easements over  acres of our land 
the price that will be received for these easements  if they are purchased  will be based upon an appraisal  which could be negatively impacted by current economic conditions 
the recent downturn in the housing industry has not impacted our resort residential segment business plan to date  which in the near term is to achieve entitlements for our residential communities 
since we are in the entitlement phase of development  we currently do not have an approved project and therefore we do not have inventory for sale in the market 
the housing industry downturn has impacted the perception of current land values due to the numerous write downs home builders have taken regarding land inventory 
this perception of land value has impacted our stock price 
the resort residential segment had an operating loss of  during  an increase of  or when compared to the prior year 
the increase in expenses when compared to was attributable to increased staffing costs of  including salary and stock compensation costs net of amounts capitalized for additional professional staff to administer and oversee our residential projects 
these employees monitor regulatory and environmental issues and provide necessary oversight functions for our joint ventures 
the increase in cost for this additional staff more than offset the absence of the tmv related compensation costs that were incurred in temporary office accommodation for these additional staff resulted in an increase in lease costs in as compared to offsetting these increases was a decline in professional service fees due to the absence of tmv related formation costs and reduced lake maintenance costs due to the lack of rainfall 

table of contents see item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
farming farming segment profits were  in  a decrease of  or  when compared to the prior year 
the decline in farming segment profits is due to decreased revenues of  and increased expenses of  the decrease in revenues is driven by lower yields for pistachios  lower almond prices  and the absence of walnut revenues as that orchard was replaced during with rubired grapes due to limited production in recent years 
expenses in our farming segment increased  primarily due to increased water cost of  from the use of more expensive supplemental water as compared to swp water and increased cultural costs as petroleum derived chemical costs increased 
grape revenues for the crop increased  to  as compared to due to increased production and higher crop prices 
grape production increased approximately  tons as compared to as our new vineyard which was planted in began production in additionally  the higher sugar content of our crop triggered a bonus payment on our rubired varietal and resulted in a higher average price for our grape crop when compared to we have long term contracts for our grape crops ranging from two to fourteen years 
grape prices are remaining relatively stable in spite of increased california production as new plantings from recent years have come into production 
the lack of water availability in california could impact production and crop prices in the future 
almond revenues decreased  in to  sales of current year crop accounted for  of revenues compared to current year crop sales in of  this increase was achieved through the sale of approximately  more pounds of almonds from the current year crop as compared to our almond revenues include  of revenue from the sale of crop almonds in as compared to  of farming revenues attributable to the sale of crop almonds 
these sales reflect amounts held in inventory at the end of the prior year and sold in the following calendar year 
more pounds of prior year almonds were carried into than were carried into  reflecting the difference in prior year crop revenues 
we are carrying approximately  pounds of almonds in our inventory at december  which will be sold in almond prices have fallen over the last several months as the global recession has had an impact on demand and the stronger dollar has made us exports more expensive on the world commodities market 
however  current prices still exceed the carrying value of our inventory 
thus far in  the price for almonds has declined substantially due to the increase in the value of the us dollar in foreign currency markets 
the current range of almond prices is to per pound 
as the value of the dollar increased over the fourth quarter of and into the first part of  along with the continuing global recession  the demand for us almonds declined 
the decline is primarily tied to almonds being more expensive for foreign buyers 
continued strengthening of the dollar and the global recession could result in continued downward pressure on prices and lack of demand for the product we are carrying in our year end inventory 
pistachio revenues decreased  in to  pistachio yields decreased  pounds in compared to due to being an off production year in the alternate bearing production cycle for pistachios 
this drop in yield was partially offset by a price increase from an average of per pound in to per pound in the price 
table of contents increase for pistachios is attributable to the smaller crop 
we expect our revenues from pistachios to increase when compared to due primarily to higher production yields for this on production year 
however a larger crop and the stronger us dollar could negatively impact the prices we receive in we removed our walnut orchard following the harvest due to declining production and have replanted the acreage with rubired grapes 
all of our crops are sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can depress prices 
with current worldwide grape production more in line with worldwide demand  the pressure on prices has been alleviated at the present time and grape prices should remain at current levels 
our long term projection is that crop production  especially of almonds and pistachios will increase on a statewide basis over time because of new plantings  which could negatively impact future prices if the growth in demand does not keep pace with production 
while demand for product has been strong both in the united states and in export markets over the last few years  the increasing strength of the dollar and the current economic downturn has recently had a negative impact on the markets 
it is too early to project crop yields and what impact that may have on prices later in water delivery and near term water availability continues to be a concern within california 
the limitation of delivery of swp water and the absence of available alternatives during the current drought could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards 
while we are impacted by this  we believe we have sufficient water resources available to meet our requirements in please see our discussion on water in item  properties water rights 
farming segment profits were  in  an increase of  or  when compared to the prior year 
the improvement in farming segment profits was due to improved revenues of  more than offsetting increased expenses of  the increase in revenues was driven by significantly higher yields for both pistachios and walnuts as compared to yields 
these improvements were partially offset by lower land lease revenues 
expenses in our farming segment increased  primarily due to higher costs associated with the production of our crops due to increased wages  chemicals and fertilizers that are derived from petroleum based products 
in  crop production costs increased  compared to  but this increase was offset by a decline in water costs of  in due to a allocation of water from the local water district 
the increased crop production costs were also offset by a decline in administrative salary costs of  due to the absence of the tmv related formation compensation costs in grape revenues for the crop declined  as compared to due to slightly lower prices 
grape production in increased by approximately tons as compared to  but the lower grape prices more than offset this increase 
almond revenues of  in were in line with revenues of  our almond revenues include  of revenue from the sale of crop almonds in as compared to  of farming revenues attributable to the sale of crop almonds 
these sales reflect amounts held in inventory at the end of the prior year and sold in the following calendar year 
almond prices during fell from the record levels experienced in late  but were relatively high compared to historical prices 
total production of almonds was approximately  pounds in as compared to  pounds in 
table of contents pistachio revenues increased  in to  yields increased  pounds due to being an on production year in the alternate bearing production cycle for pistachios and this improved yield more than offset the decline in prices from an average of per pound in to per pound in the price decline for pistachios that we experienced is attributable to the large production increase in walnut revenue from the crop was  an increase of  when compared to the crop 
the walnut yields improved  pounds due to better weather conditions for walnut crops in as compared to we also recognized  of insurance proceeds during related to the walnut crop 
due to the significant decline in the walnut crop yield of less than of its average expected production  the crop qualified for an insurance payment 
the inconsistent performance of the walnuts over the last several years led us to remove these trees from production in order to prepare for a new rubired grape vineyard 
we began removal of the trees on late for further discussion of the farming operations  refer to item i business farming operations

corporate expenses corporate expenses remained consistent during when compared to as a result of a decrease in stock compensation expenses of  during  salary and overhead expenses decreased overall by  the decrease in stock compensation expense occurred due to the reversal of stock compensation costs related to performance stock awards that did not vest 
offsetting this decrease were increases in amortization expense of long term water contracts and increases in costs related to directors and officers insurance premiums and higher professional service fees 
corporate expenses decreased  to  during the decrease during was due primarily to the absence of  of compensation costs incurred in upon successful completion of the tmv llc joint venture agreement 
charitable donations decreased in by  because the prior year included contributions of stock that were not repeated in directors stock compensation costs decreased  in due to a decline in the stock price used to compute the expense 

table of contents equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures during  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures 
the largest single component of these earnings consisted of our portion of the equity in the earnings of ta petro of  the balance of the net earnings from joint ventures consisted of earnings from five west parcel of  losses from tmv llc of  losses from centennial founders of  and a loss of  on the dissolution of tejon dermody llc 
earnings from our ta petro joint venture continued to increase in due to higher fuel margins and improved operating efficiencies 
our original partner in the ta petro joint venture  petro stopping centers  was purchased by travelcenters of america in however  this change of ownership has had no impact on the operations of our jointly owned petro travel plaza llc  and we do not anticipate any impact in the future 
losses from the centennial and tmv joint ventures did not vary significantly from those incurred in within our centennial joint venture  two of our partners  pardee homes and standard pacific  are home builders 
as with other home builders their businesses have declined over the last two years and their internal financing has become more difficult 
at the present time  despite the current market in housing  both of these partners continue to be committed to the centennial development 
if it becomes necessary for one or more of our current partners to leave the joint venture  the centennial joint venture operating agreement requires the exiting partner to leave its capital contributions in the venture 
its capital investment would be paid back in the future from operating profits 
construction of a  square foot speculative industrial building which began in was completed during february this building was constructed by our five west parcel joint venture and is financed by a construction loan that matures in throughout much of the building was partially leased to ikea on a temporary basis 
we currently are marketing the building and anticipate leasing the building in to a new tenant or tenants  however the current economic environment is going to make this more difficult 
currently the joint venture has adequate cash resources to cover operating costs related to the building while it is being marketed for lease 
during  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures 
the largest single component of these earnings consisted of our portion of the gain that was realized on the sale of the industrial building owned by the tejon dermody joint venture 
the building was sold for a pretax gain of  of which we recognized

losses from the centennial and tmv joint ventures did not vary significantly from those incurred in income taxes for financial statement purposes  our effective tax rate for was after taking into consideration permanent and temporary timing differences 
the tax expense for was  during  our largest permanent tax difference was related to depletion allowances 
our tax benefit at december  is  additionally  temporary timing differences and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options reduced our liability 

table of contents for  we had net deferred tax assets of  our largest deferred tax assets were made up of temporary differences related to the capitalization of costs  pension adjustments  stock grant expense and deferred accounting gains on land sales 
deferred tax liabilities consist of deferred gains  cost of sale allocations  and straight line rent 
due to the nature of our deferred tax assets  we believe they will be used in future years and an allowance is not necessary 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow and liquidity 
our strong financial position allows us to pursue our strategies of land entitlement  development  and conservation 
accordingly  we have established well defined priorities for our available cash  including investing in core business segments to achieve profitable future growth 
to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to make investments in our real estate segments to secure land entitlement approvals  build infrastructure for our developments  ensure adequate future water supplies  and provide funds for general land development activities 
within our farming segment  we will make investments as needed to improve efficiency and add capacity to its operations when it is profitable to do so 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of  from the corresponding amount at the end of cash and marketable securities decreased in due to a variety of factors 
significant cash inflows including net maturities of investment securities of  proceeds from the sale of real estate of  net borrowings of short term debt of  and cash from the exercise of stock options of  were more than offset by investments in our real estate projects of  investments in joint ventures of  water purchases of  and tax payments of  the following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the last three years year ended december in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities our operations provided  of cash during which reflects a decline of  compared to cash provided by operations in the decrease in net income combined with the absence of distributions of earnings from joint ventures and payments of income taxes more than offset collections of receivables  reduction of inventory balances and increases in payables 
net cash provided by operations during increased to  from  in  primarily as a result of the increase in net revenue and distributions from joint ventures 
the non cash nature of some of our operating expenses such as stock compensation and depreciation also helped to improve net cash  while increases in deferred taxes  prepaid expenses  accounts receivable and earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures utilized operating funds 

table of contents investing activities utilized  of funds in compared to  in and  in investments for these years were primarily dominated by investments in our real estate projects  water purchases and investments in our farming operations 
capital investments of  in include real estate projects of  that are primarily related to infrastructure development at tic and to the capitalization of costs related to our entitlement activities in our real estate projects and during  in our conservation agreement 
we also invested  in our centennial joint venture and made a non cash contribution of land with a book value of  to the ta petro joint venture 
we anticipate that our capital investment requirements for could be as high as  these estimated investments include approximately  of infrastructure and entitlement investment for real estate development projects and approximately  of investment within our farm operations for the completion of a new grape vineyard and the replacement of equipment 
in we expect to contribute  to our various joint ventures and make other capital investments of  of this other capital investment amount  we expect approximately  will be invested in the purchase of water inventory and water related contracts 
we continue to add to our current water assets to help secure our ability to supply water to our farming and real estate activities and as a future investment  since we believe that the cost of water in california will continue to increase 
investments in water are expected to continue at varied levels in future years 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during resulted from borrowings of  on our credit line and  from the exercise of stock options 
the funds were utilized to purchase land in san diego and to purchase additional water assets 
we also used these funds to make contributions to our centennial joint venture 
maturing securities and proceeds from the sale of land were used to repay  of the borrowing 
we use this credit facility to fulfill cash needs that are not met by maturing securities or operating inflows due to the timing of those activities 
our funds provided by financing activities of  during resulted from cash received from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from stock based compensation 
it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations and the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  the timing aspect of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
capital structure and financial condition 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of  of debt and  of equity and resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of under  which is a increase over the prior year s debt to total capitalization ratio 
we have a long term revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of  and as of february  had an outstanding balance of  the increase in borrowings against the line of credit during the first quarter of is tied to the timing of maturities within our investment portfolio and the purchase of additional water in january at the company s option  the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed at 
table of contents over a selected libor rate or float at less than the bank s prime lending rate 
the interest rate on the line of credit is currently 
during the term of this credit facility  we can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re borrow  as necessary 
currently we are in compliance with all covenants related to our line of credit and do not expect to be out of compliance during any outstanding principal balance is due and payable in full in september this note is unsecured 
the outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  is  at december  this debt is being used to provide long term financing for a building being leased to starbucks and the debt is secured by the leased building and land 
our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from current cash and marketable securities  cash flow from ongoing operations  proceeds from the sale of developed and undeveloped parcels  potential sales of assets  sales of easements over our land  additional use of debt  proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through the community facilities district bond debt described below under off balance sheet arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
as noted above  we have  in cash and securities at december  and current availability on lines of credit to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial future investments will be required in order to develop our land assets 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we may need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  sales of easements  and the issuance of common stock 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our cash needs and our capital investment requirements over the next few years

table of contents transaction 
based on this definition  the table above includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
our cash contract commitments consist of contracts in various stages of completion related to infrastructure development within our industrial developments and entitlement costs related to our industrial and residential development projects 
at the present time  we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations outstanding 
our operating lease obligations are for office equipment  several vehicles  and a temporary trailer providing office space and average approximately  per month 
our financial obligations to the conservancy are prescribed in the conservation agreement 
our advances to the conservancy are dependent on the occurrence of certain events and their timing  and are therefore subject to change in amount and period 
the amounts included above are the minimum amounts we anticipate contributing through the year the obligation shown above represents one half of the total required obligations under the conservation agreement  as the other one half of the obligation is being funded by our partners in the tmv llc and the centennial founders  llc 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension and supplemental retirement plans 
any payments related to the supplemental executive retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company 
in addition  minimum pension funding requirements are not included above  as such amounts are not available for all periods presented 
during  we made approximately  in pension plan contributions  compared to  in pension plan contributions in we estimate that we will contribute approximately  to the pension plan in off balance sheet arrangements the following table shows contingent obligations we have with respect to the cfd

the standby letter of credit is in place to provide additional credit enhancement and covers approximately two years worth of interest on the outstanding bonds 
the annual cost for this letter of credit is approximately  per year 
this letter of credit will not be drawn upon unless we  as the largest landowner in the district  fail to make our property tax payments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an investment grade rating from moody s or standard and poor s 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit  which as of december  had an outstanding balance of  and as of february  had an outstanding balance of  and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
the long term debt  as of december  has a fixed interest rate and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the floating rate feature in our line of credit can expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
we believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of floating rate interest payments and in the past have entered into interest rate swaps to manage those fluctuations 
at december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
however  petro  an unconsolidated joint venture  has an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  of its long term debt to manage interest rate risk by converting floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matures in november and is a contract to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement 
the interest rate swap fixed rate is 
market risk related to our inventories ultimately depends on the value of the almonds  grapes  and pistachios  at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of our marketable securities and debt obligations

our risk with 
table of contents regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased slightly related to marketable securities since these balances have decreased compared to the prior year 
commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
inventories consist of farming and processing costs related to almond production and crop production 
the farming costs inventoried are recorded as actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are often recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december    is at risk to changing prices 
of that amount   is attributable to almonds and  to pistachios 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  related to almonds   related to pistachios  and  related to walnuts 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every change in the price of almonds  our receivable for almonds changes by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years prices have ranged from to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  so for each change in the price of pistachios  our receivable changes by  and the range of final prices over the last three years for pistachios has been to
