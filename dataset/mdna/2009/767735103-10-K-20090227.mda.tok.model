item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
actual results and timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading provider of risk management and corporate governance products and services to participants in the global financial markets  as measured by revenues 
our products and services enable investors to measure and manage the market  credit  portfolio  governance  accounting  legal and environmental risks associated with their financial holdings 
these offerings address multiple asset classes  markets and geographies to a broad group of market participants  including asset managers  hedge funds  pension funds  banks  insurance companies  financial advisors and corporations 
clients rely on us to better understand and manage risk of their financial holdings  to provide greater transparency to both their internal and external constituencies  to satisfy regulatory and reporting requirements and to make better investment decisions 
our growth strategy is focused on the following increasing sales to existing clients by providing additional data  research  analytical products and processing services  which we believe will be enhanced by leveraging our combined riskmetrics and iss sales forces  expanding our client base by further penetrating our markets  including expanding our global footprint and attracting new clients  especially financial institutions which currently rely on internally developed risk management and proxy voting solutions  and enhancing and extending our products and services  including the creation of new product and service offerings and by selectively pursuing acquisitions  while leveraging the economies of scale in our cost structure to grow revenues at a greater rate than operating expenses and thereby increase our operating margin 
as of december   we had approximately  clients located in countries 
among our clients are of the largest investment managers  of the largest mutual fund companies  of the largest hedge funds  in each case as measured by assets under management 
we benefit from a number of favorable attributes of our business model 
these attributes include subscription based revenue model we sell our services primarily on an annual subscription basis and have experienced high renewal rates 
recurring revenues accounted for approximately of 
table of contents our total revenues in the year ended december   and we had a renewal rate of during that time 
our subscription model and high renewal rates minimize volatility in our revenues and provide significant visibility for our future results 
leveragable cost structure because we provide our services from a common technology and data infrastructure  we benefit from economies of scale 
as a result  we have generally been able to increase adjusted ebitda margins as our revenues have grown 
favorable cash flow characteristics our subscription based revenues and leveragable cost structure  combined with our positive working capital characteristics and low capital expenditure requirements  have historically allowed us to generate significant cash flow 
in evaluating our results  we focus on several key financial and operating data including annualized contract value  renewal rates  sales to new customers  non recurring revenues and adjusted ebitda 
our annualized contract value  which is described in detail below  is a leading indicator of our business and represents a large portion of our revenue in any given period 
we track our performance across geographies and product and service lines 
we expect to invest in our business to continue to grow our revenues 
compensation  data acquisition and technology infrastructure costs represent significant components of our operating expense structure 
while we expect to increase our operating expenses over time to take advantage of market opportunities  we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our operating expenses at a lower rate than revenues and thereby increase our operating margins 
the vast majority of our business involves the sale of products and services to clients in the financial services industry  including asset managers  banks  insurance companies  hedge funds  pension funds as well as professional organizations that serve the financial services industry 
the global financial markets have been adversely impacted by the current market environment that includes illiquidity  market volatility  widening credit spreads  changes in interest rates  currency exchange fluctuations and new legal and compliance requirements 
these market conditions and the reduced business activity have had a negative impact on a number of our clients and could negatively impact our future revenues due to the potential for declining sales and renewal rates 
we do not believe that our liquidity has been affected by the recent events in the global financial markets 
refer to liquidity and capital resources discussion 
our revenues we generate a substantial majority of our revenues from annual subscriptions to our products and services  for which our clients generally pay us in advance 
these contracts generally renew automatically on an annual basis 
our products and services are generally priced based on the access to our applications and services  including research  voting and reports purchased 
we do not price our products and services based on our clients assets under management 
as a result  we generally are not directly subject to revenue fluctuations resulting from changes in our clients assets under management aum 
our experience has been that  over time  our clients have often added users and purchased additional products and services from us  which has led to increases in our revenues per client 

table of contents revenues from subscription contracts are referred to as recurring revenues 
recurring revenues are generated through the renewal of existing contracts and the signing of new subscription contracts 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues were generated from these subscription contracts 
the subscription fees received from our clients are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized each month as our services are rendered 
our renewal rate  which was for the year ended december   combined with our level of new subscription contracts  determine our annualized contract value  which is a leading indicator of our recurring revenues 
our annualized contract value as of december  was million 
we also generate non recurring revenue from sales of products and services without a subscription contract  which represented of total revenues during the year ended december  annualized contract value acv as a result of our subscription based model and historically high renewal rates  at the end of any period  we generally have subscription contracts in place for a high percentage of our total revenues for the next months 
we monitor the contracted revenues from these agreements and refer to them as annualized contract value 
we define our annualized contract value as the aggregate value on an annualized basis of all recurring subscription contracts in effect on a reporting date 
any revenues associated with subscription contracts that are entered into during a reporting period will be reflected in the annualized contract value beginning at the end of that period 
as a result  annualized contract value at the end of any period is the annualized contract value at the beginning of the period plus the annualized contract revenue associated with new subscription contracts signed during that period minus the annualized contract revenues associated with subscription contracts not renewed 
annualized contract value does not include any fees associated with any non recurring revenues 
annualized contract value is an important metric for our business 
however  annualized contract value may differ from our future reported revenues due to a number of factors  which include new subscription based revenues  additional one time revenue  changes in the contract value of our subscription contracts  cancellations and non renewals of subscription contracts  and revenue recognition timing differences due to the provisions of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
our annualized contract value for the riskmetrics business and iss business as of december   and  as well as the percentage growth period over period is set forth  separately for each business  in the table below 
iss acv growth in was complemented by the acquisition of million from cfra on august  as of december  amounts in thousands  except for percentages riskmetrics business annualized contract value percent growth iss business annualized contract value percent growth current market conditions have led to foreign currency fluctuations  lower than average historical renewal rates and sales growth  which may negatively impact acv growth 

table of contents renewal rate because non renewals of subscription contracts decrease our annualized contract value  which in turn decreases our revenues  a key operating metric is renewal rate 
our renewal rate for any period is defined as the amount of annualized contract value that renews in a period divided by the amount of annualized contract value with an expiration date during that period 
if a client has a higher contract value upon renewal of its existing contract  the amount in excess of the prior period s contract is considered new contract revenue for purposes of this calculation 
the renewal rate for our riskmetrics business and iss business for the years ended december   and  is set forth separately for each business  in the table below 
we have calculated the renewal rate for our riskmetrics business for the year ended december  including the jpmorgan online services agreement that was terminated as of april the lower renewal rate for riskmetrics for the fiscal year ended december  was due largely to the termination of the jpmorgan online contract which accounted for approximately  or half of the non renewal rate for that period 
year ended december  riskmetrics business renewal rate iss business renewal rate overall  consolidated renewal rates were for the year ended december  as compared with in the prior year 
riskmetrics achieved a renewal rate of which decreased compared to the prior year rate of  while iss had a renewal rate of which decreased compared to the prior year rate of 
the riskmetrics renewal rate declined mainly due to higher non renewals in the alternative investment segment offset by steady renewal rates in the asset management and banking segments 
the iss renewal rate declined primarily due to lower renewal rates in corporate services and cfra products as well as an approximate basis point decline in the proxy business renewal rate 
non recurring revenues non recurring revenues result from sales on a non subscription basis 
non recurring revenues for the riskmetrics business and iss business for the years ended december   and are set forth in the table below 
our non subscription services include implementation  compensation advisory services and similar services and overages related to iss proxy research and voting business 
revenues from implementation are recognized as the related subscription service is provided  some compensation advisory services revenues are recognized over a three month period and other non recurring revenues are recognized once the service is provided 
to the extent that clients actual usage of proxy voting services or proxy research reports exceeds contracted for limits  the excess usage is considered to be an overage and clients may be charged additional fees 
our clients overages are typically an indication of larger proxy voting contract renewals 
year ended december  riskmetrics business percent non recurring revenue iss business percent non recurring revenue our operating costs and expenses compensation expense represents a substantial majority of our expenses across all of our operating functions 
compensation expenses before stock based compensation expense are comprised of base 
table of contents salary  bonuses  benefits  payroll taxes and sales commissions 
while we expect to grow our headcount over time to take advantage of our market opportunity  we believe that the economies of scale in our operating model will allow us to grow our compensation expenses at a lower rate than revenues 
other significant operating expenses are data  proxy voting fees  occupancy and telecommunications and web hosting costs 
since we deliver our products and services using a common data and technology infrastructure  we expect these expenses to generally increase at less than the rate of revenue growth 
overall  our goal is to keep the rate of growth of these operating expenses below the rate of growth of our revenues 
however  in order to take advantage of growth opportunities  we may invest in our business in order to support increased revenue growth 
this might result in variability in our operating margin in the short term 
we allocate compensation expenses  including stock based compensation expense  to our cost of revenues  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expense categories based on the actual costs associated with each employee 
other costs associated with the employees  such as occupancy  travel and telecommunications  are included in the same cost categories as the corresponding employees 
we allocate shared services to each segment based on usage or headcount 
the following summarizes our significant operating expenses costs of revenues costs of revenues include costs related to production of proxy research and voting  web hosting  data  account management  implementation and systems operations and allowances for doubtful accounts 
costs in this area consist primarily of staff compensation and related costs and payments to third party vendors  including third party web hosting and data providers 
research and development research and development expenses include costs related to product development  research technology  application design  technology infrastructure and analytics development 
costs in this area consist primarily of staff compensation costs and related expenses and consultant expenses 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist of costs related to our sales force  product management and marketing professionals 
these costs include staff compensation costs and related expenses  including commissions and general marketing costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of expenses for finance  legal  accounting  human resources and information technology personnel 
costs in this area primarily consist of staff compensation and related expenses  legal costs  insurance costs  audit and accounting fees and other professional services fees 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment includes depreciation of software  computer and related equipment  furniture and fixtures and telecommunications equipment  which is recorded over the respective useful lives of the related assets 
depreciation also includes the amortization of leasehold improvements which are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the assets useful life  and the amortization of capitalized software costs 
amortization expense for leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs are included in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment in the statements of operations 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization expense includes the amortization of finite life intangible assets such as acquired technology  customer relationships  trade names  proprietary process and non compete agreements acquired  which are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  require the application of significant judgment in the preparation of our financial statements  and as a result they are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  we use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in calculating estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are generated from contracted annual subscriptions  for which we receive licensing fees from clients who utilize services 
depending on the service offering  the services are available through a variety of delivery options  including hosted web applications  fully outsourced managed services  and local software installation 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription period which is typically one year 
subscription revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  since the company provides its application as a service 
the company also recognizes revenue on software sales in accordance with the aicpa sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
license fees associated with local software installations  for the riskmetrics business  are recognized over the term of the license period  typically one year 
the arrangement for local installation is a multiple element arrangement that consists of software  post contract support pcs including unspecified upgrades and enhancements  and other service elements 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license as there is no vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value for pcs or the other service elements because they are not priced separately or sold separately to customers and there is no discernable pattern in which pcs and other services are expected to be performed 
the iss business provides proxy advisory and voting services  corporate governance and financial research and analysis services to institutional investors and corporations 
the majority of iss s products and services are delivered through a web based platform and are typically provided through annual subscription agreements 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
many of iss s subscription agreements are multiple element arrangements that provide for the delivery 
table of contents of more than one iss product or service 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription as each of the services specified in these multiple element arrangements are performed continuously over the subscription term and there is no discernable pattern in which the services will be performed 
in situations where contracts include client acceptance provisions  we do not recognize revenue until such time as the client has confirmed its acceptance 
some of our subscription contracts include automatic renewal provisions under existing contract terms 
reserves for possible losses on subscription service  if any  are recognized when determined 
a portion of our revenues are derived from non subscription services including implementation  compensation advisory services and overages related to proxy research and voting services 
revenues from implementation are recognized as the services are provided and other non recurring revenues are recognized once the service is provided or upon delivery of the required service 
goodwill and intangibles goodwill  which consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired  is evaluated for impairment using a two step process that is performed at least annually on october of each year  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the implied value of goodwill is determined as of the test date by performing a purchase price allocation  as if the reporting unit had just been acquired  using currently estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  together with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon information available regarding prices of similar groups of assets  or other valuation techniques including present value techniques based upon estimates of future cash flows 
intangible assets  including acquired technology  customer relationships  certain trade names and non compete agreements arising principally from acquisitions  are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and our finite lived intangibles are amortized using the straight line method of over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset 
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives  such as certain trade names  are not amortized and are subject to an annual impairment tests or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
for other intangible assets subject to amortization  impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset 
as of december   we had goodwill and intangible assets of million 
during  we recorded a non cash impairment charge to goodwill and intangible assets totaling million as a result of our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment review 
the impairment charge includes a million write down to iss goodwill primarily as a result of the negative equity market conditions which caused a material decline in industry market multiples in the second half of the fair value of the iss reporting unit was determined using a combination of present value techniques  including a discounted cash flow  as well as fair values of comparable businesses 
in addition  the impairment charge includes a million write down to an iss product tradename as a result of an integration plan for the tradename which reduced its expected life 

table of contents there are many assumptions and estimates that may directly impact the results of impairment testing  including market valuations of comparable companies  earnings multiples  estimate of future expected revenues  earnings and cash flows  and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for testing 
to mitigate undue influence  we set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite lived acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting unit 
changes in market valuations  earnings multiples and our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas r  as of january  sfas r replaced the existing requirements under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to employees  or apb according to sfas r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  are treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
under sfas r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the expense is recognized ratably over the award s vesting period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized compensation for unvested awards under the graded vesting method  and will continue to do so in all grants made prior to january  for all grants made subsequent to december   we recognize compensation cost under the straight line method 
we measure the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model which requires the use of several estimates  including the volatility of our stock price  the expected life of the option  risk free interest rates  and expected dividend yield 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering in january  we were not a publicly traded company  and as a result we had limited historical information on the price of our common stock 
as a result  we could not solely rely on historical experience alone to develop assumptions for stock price volatility 
as such  our stock price volatility also considered an estimated volatility with reference to a peer group of companies 
the expected life of options is based on internal studies of historical experience and projected exercise behavior 
we estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
we utilize a risk free interest rate  which is based on the yield of us zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the options 
we have not and do not expect to pay dividends on our common shares 
we estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
the forfeiture assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions may impact the 
table of contents timing of the total amount of expense recognized over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  the use of different assumptions in the black scholes model would result in different amounts of stock based compensation expense 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent needed  we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  if it determines it is not more likely than not that the assets will be utilized in the future 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an approximate million increase in the current tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a decrease to the january  balance of retained earnings 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million  and if such liability was reversed would favorably impact our effective tax rate 
results of operations segments and periods presented prior to january   we operated as a single reportable segment 
as a result of our acquisition of iss and based on a review of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have determined that we currently operate in two segments  the riskmetrics business and the iss business 
we have provided a discussion of our results of operations on a consolidated basis and have also provided certain detailed discussions for each of our segments 
we have done so because the results of iss are not included in our results of operations until january   but constitute a substantial portion of our business 
as a result  in order to provide a meaningful discussion of our ongoing business  we have provided a discussion of riskmetrics and iss segment results for compared to factors affecting the comparability of results as discussed above  our acquisition of iss impacts the comparability of our results of operations 
in addition  the financial results of cfra  which was acquired on august   have been included in the results of our iss business only since the date of its acquisition 
cfra supplements the iss business and supports the financial research and analysis product and services offerings 
in january  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included  shares sold by selling stockholders and  shares sold by riskmetrics 
table of contents group to cover over allotments  which was exercised in full in january we received net proceeds of million from the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholders 
as such  weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  includes  additional shares sold in the initial public offering 
in addition  immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering we granted each of our full time employees an option to acquire shares of our common stock  at an exercise price equal to the initial public offering price 
such grant resulted in stock based compensation of million being recorded for the year ended december  in january  we utilized a portion of proceeds from the initial public offering to prepay the entire outstanding indebtedness under the second lien loan  in the amount of million 
as a result of the prepayment we incurred million in expenses during the year ended december   which were comprised of a million debt prepayment penalty fee  a million write off of debt issuance costs and a million loss on an interest rate swap settlement 
such costs have been included in interest  dividend  investment and other income expense  net in the statement of operations for the year ended december  in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge to goodwill and intangible assets totaling million as a result of our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment review 
the impairment charge includes a million write down to iss goodwill primarily as a result of the negative equity market conditions which caused a material decline in industry market multiples in the second half of in addition  the impairment charge includes a million write down to an iss product tradename as a result of an integration plan for the tradename which reduced its expected life

no assurances can be given that additional financing will be available in the future or that if available  such financing will be on favorable terms

long term debt in connection with the purchase of iss on january   we incurred million of indebtedness  which was comprised of first lien and second lien term loans and a first lien revolving credit facility 
the terms of the indebtedness include various covenant compliance requirements  including maintaining certain adjusted ebitda earning levels  as defined in our credit facilities 
the company has pledged all of its assets as collateral against the debt 
amounts paid under the term loans may not be re borrowed 
as of december   million of debt remains outstanding under the first lien loan and no indebtedness remain outstanding under the second lien term loan or first lien revolving credit facility 
the maturity date of the first lien term loan is december in february  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to reduce interest rate risks and to manage interest expense 
by entering into these agreements  we change the fixed variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio 
as of december   the interest rate swaps had notional amounts totaling million and a fair value liability totaling million 
the agreements effectively convert our floating rate debt into fixed rate debt 
this reduces our risk of incurring higher interest costs in periods of rising interest rates and increases our risk of paying higher interest costs in periods of decreasing interest rates 
our interest rate swap agreements hedge a significant portion of the interest rate risk exposure under our indebtedness 
the interest rate swap agreements increased our weighted average effective interest rate on the first lien term loan facility to during the year ended december  the interest rate on the company s debt was reduced by basis points in april due to a reduction in the company s consolidated debt leverage ratio 
in january  we utilized a portion of proceeds from our initial public offering to prepay the entire outstanding indebtedness under our second lien term loan which amounted to million 
in addition  we paid a prepayment penalty fee  or million  upon repayment as set forth in the credit agreement 
in conjunction with the repayment of our second loan lien  we wrote off debt 
table of contents issuance costs of million and reduced the notional amount of our interest rate swap by million which resulted in additional expense of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we paid an excess cash flow principal payment of million for our first lien term loan  as required by the credit facility 
the next principal debt payment of million is due on june  as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of our credit agreements  and we are not aware of any future events or transactions that will impact such compliance 
commitments in addition to the indebtedness discussed above  we enter into routine operating lease obligations for our facilities and purchase obligations to operate our business 
our contractual commitments  including those related to our indebtedness  were comprised of the following as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total within year years years after years debt  including estimated interest interest rate swaps operating leases purchase obligation for data deferred purchase price obligation total obligation relates to prior acquisitions made by iss 
does not include million of liabilities for uncertain tax liabilities 
the timing of future cash flows associated with our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is highly uncertain and we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
on february   we signed a definitive stock purchase agreement to acquire innovest strategic value advisors for approximately million in cash  subject to working capital adjustments 
this amount does not include approximately million of cash expected to be used in march to complete the acquisition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future impact upon our financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation our business may be significantly or adversely affected by inflation 
due to the high degree of competition in the marketplace  inflation rate increases might lead to an erosion of our profit margins 
related party transaction in may  we entered into a contract for the sale of market risk products to duff capital advisors  which expires on march  philip duff  a director of the company  is the founder  ceo and general partner of duff capital advisors

 fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities such as goodwill  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the company s financial statements at fair value at least annually 
accordingly  we adopted the provisions of sfas only for its financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis effective january  the company s financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of derivative instruments see note of the consolidated financial statements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
us gaap required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which may reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of asset and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of these assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the company adopted sfas on january  but did not elect the fair value option for any qualifying financial instruments presented in the consolidated financial statements 
on december   fasb issued statement no

sfas r is generally required to be adopted concurrently with statement no 
and is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  application of sfas r and sfas is required to be adopted prospectively  except for certain provisions of sfas  which are required to be adopted retrospectively 
business combination transactions accounted for before adoption of sfas r should be accounted for in accordance with sfas and that accounting previously completed under statement no

the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fsp fas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk associated with short and long term debt bearing variable interest rates 
to manage this interest rate risk exposure  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk  which can adversely affect our sales and operating profits 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k  which provides further information on our derivative instruments 
interest rate sensitivity to reduce the exposure associated with our variable rate debt  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to reduce interest rate risks and to manage interest expense 
by entering into these agreements  we change the fixed variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio 
as of december   the interest rate swaps had notional amounts totaling million and a fair value liability totaling million 
the agreements effectively convert our floating rate debt into fixed rate debt 
this reduces our risk of incurring higher interest costs in periods of rising interest rates 
our interest rate swap agreements hedge a substantial majority of the interest rate risk exposure under our indebtedness 
the interest rate swap agreements increased our weighted average effective interest rate on the first lien term loan facility to during the year ended december  a hypothetical  instantaneous increase of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to the variable interest rate debt would have increased our net interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
exchange rate sensitivity we have two separate exposures to currency fluctuation risk subsidiaries outside the united states which use a foreign currency as their functional currency which are translated into us dollars for consolidation of assets and liabilities and non us dollar invoiced revenues 
changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency are translated into us dollars and result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies including the euro  pounds sterling  canadian dollar  and a limited number of other non us dollar currencies 
the net potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by a corresponding appreciation of the us dollar  as of december   amounts to million 
we primarily invoice our clients in us dollars  however  we also invoice a portion of our clients in euro  sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen and a limited number of other non us dollar currencies 
as such  the fluctuations in such currencies could impact our operating results
