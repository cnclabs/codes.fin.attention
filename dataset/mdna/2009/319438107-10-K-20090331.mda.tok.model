nationwide in  concerns over asset quality  precipitated by issues related to slowing real estate activity  declining real estate values  turbulence in the financial sector  decline in interest rates  the current regulatory environment and general economic conditions resulted in significant declines in financial results 
the impact of these concerns is reflected in the economic markets in which the company operates  principally through slowing real estate activity  declining real estate values and asset quality concerns 
residential acquisition and development lending and builder construction lending have been significantly scaled back as housing activity across our markets has declined 
as a result  the company significantly increased its provision for loan losses to million for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the same period in the allowance for loan losses increased to million as of december  or of total loans compared to 
at the end of the same period last year 
net charge offs increased significantly from thousand for the year to thousand for the year ended december  nonperforming assets also increased drastically from thousand as of december  or 
of assets to million as of december  or of assets

table of contents from the balance at december  certificates of deposit increased million or and represent of deposits with maturities ranging from six months to five years 
money market accounts and now accounts increased million or with the continued success of the capital reserve account which has a variable rate tied to the stated fed funds rate 
low cost demand deposits increased or million to million at december  net interest margin decreased in from for the year ended december  to at december  the net interest margin was for the same period in the decrease in the net interest margin is attributed to steady reduction in interest rates over the last two years 
over the twenty four months ended december   the federal reserve bank s federal open market committee fomc cut the federal funds targeted rate and the associated prime rate on interest ten times or basis points from on january  to on december  for the period january  to december   the fomc cut the targeted federal funds rate and the associated prime rate seven times or basis points from on january  to on december  total non interest expense increased or million for the year ended december  additions to staff to support business development and retail branching contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits 
occupancy and depreciation expense increased as the result of the opening of the new bon air branch in the second quarter of the fdic assessment increase as the result of a revised premium structure but primarily from the increase in deposits during the period 
the virginia capital stock tax increased as the result of increased investment in first capital bank by first capital bancorp  inc during we remain well capitalized with capital ratios above the regulatory minimums 
as we enter however  the financial sector remains in turmoil 
pressure continues on the net interest margin and asset quality continues to deteriorate 
critical accounting policies the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and applications of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
first capital bank s critical accounting policy relates to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb loss in the bank s existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan loss based on available information including the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan losses to the extent available due to limited history  specific impaired loans  availability and quality of the collateral  age of the various portfolios  changes in local economic conditions  and loan performance and quality of the portfolio 
different assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses could result in material changes in its financial condition and results of operations 
the bank s policies with respect to the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses involve a high degree of complexity and require management to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about certain matters 
this critical policy and its assumptions are periodically reviewed with the bank s board of directors 
the bank evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas 
table of contents no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  loans past due by days or more  and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the bank makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas no 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan and general collateral type 
a loss rate range reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given collateral type  terms of the loan  borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies and charge off and recovery experience 
the amount of estimated impairment of individually evaluated loans and the range of estimated losses for groups of loans are added together for a total range of estimated loan losses 
this range of estimated losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the bank as of the evaluation date and  if the range of estimated losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the range of estimated losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the range of estimated losses is evaluated to determine whether a reduction to the allowance would be necessary 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net income net income for the year ended december  decreased to thousand from million for the year ended december  returns on equity and assets for the year ended december  were and  respectively  compared to and for the year ended december  loan growth resulted in an increase in interest income as interest on loans increased million to million for the year ended december   down from a million increase in total interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  for  earnings per diluted share were compared to and for and  respectively

table of contents net interest income we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
interest expense is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
net interest income represents our principal source of earnings 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

non performing assets we place loans on a non accrual when the collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when we place a loan on non accrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals on interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses to be charged against earnings

these lines of credit  which bear interest at prevailing market rates  permit us to borrow funds in the overnight market  and are renewable annually 
advances from the fhlb constitute convertible advances with contractual maturities of five to ten years 
all convertible advances have a call option remaining of various terms 
interest rate sensitivity the most important element of asset liability management is the monitoring of the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements 
the income stream of the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or repriced in specific periods 
our goal is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk to changes in interest rates 
we seek to meet this goal by influencing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of the various lending and deposit taking lines of business and by managing discretionary balance sheet asset and liability portfolios 

table of contents we monitor interest rate levels on a daily basis at meetings of the asset liability sub committee 
the following reports and or tools are used to assess the current interest rate environment and its impact on our earnings and liquidity monthly and year to date net interest margin and spread calculations  monthly and year to date balance sheet and income statements versus budget  quarterly net portfolio value analysis  a weekly survey of rates offered by other local competitive institutions and gap analysis matching maturities or repricing dates of interest sensitive assets to those of interest sensitive liabilities by periods and a risk manager model used to measure earnings at risk and economic value of equity at risk 
the data in the following table reflects repricing or expected maturities of various assets and liabilities 
the gap analysis represents the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap analysis presents a position that existed at one particular point in time  and assumes that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics will reprice at the same time and to the same degree
