item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements for the year ended december  the application of these policies requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on a combination of historical experience and reasonable judgment applied to other facts 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
in addition  the use of different assumptions or judgments may result in different estimates 
we believe our critical accounting policies that are subject to these estimates are revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves  inventory valuation  stock based compensation  and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves we defer revenue recognition on products sold to distributors until our distributors sell the products to their customers  because our distributors generally have rights to return products to us for stock rotation  stock reduction  or replacement of defective product 
the amount of deferred revenue net of related cost of revenue is classified as deferred income on shipments to distributors on our balance sheet 
we use inventory reports received from our distributors at the end of each reporting period to determine the extent of inventory at the distributor  and thus  the amount of income to defer 
stock rotation and stock reduction from our distributors generally results in a balance sheet adjustment to our deferred income and does not impact our revenue or cost of revenue 
we generally recognize revenues on sales to customers other than distributors upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
most of our customers other than distributors do not have rights of return except under warranty 
we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables at the end of each reporting period based on the aging of the receivable balance  historical trends  and communications with our customers 
if actual bad debts are significantly different from our estimates our operating results will be affected 
inventory valuation our inventories primarily consist of component parts used to assemble our products after we receive orders from our customers 
we purchase or have manufactured the component parts required by our engineering bill of materials 
the timing and quantity of our purchases are based on order forecasts  the lead time requirements of our vendors  and on economic order quantities 
at the end of each reporting period  we compare our inventory on hand to our forecasted requirements for the next nine month period  and write off the cost of any inventory that is surplus  less any amounts that we believe we can recover from disposal of goods that we specifically believe will be saleable past a nine month horizon 
our sales forecasts are based upon historical trends  communications from customers  and marketing data regarding market trends and dynamics  which we discuss in item  business 
surplus or obsolete inventory can also be created by changes to our engineering bill of materials 
charges for the amounts we record as surplus or obsolete inventory are included in cost of revenue 

table of contents stock based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas r for fiscal years ended december  and onward 
sfas r requires all share based awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date 
under sfas r  the company uses a binomial lattice valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants made on or after january  the binomial lattice model incorporates calculations for expected volatility  risk free interest rates  employee exercise patterns and post vesting employment termination behavior  and these factors affect the estimate of the fair value of the company s stock option grants 
the fair value of stock option grants outstanding as of the effective date is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model used under sfas the company adopted the modified prospective recognition method and implemented the provisions of sfas r beginning with the first quarter of valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
also in accordance with sfas  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined it is appropriate to report as a single unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit at december  was calculated using the income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit was calculated by estimating the present value of associated future cash flows 
in addition  we also review the market capitalization of the company in conjunction with our analysis of goodwill impairment 
we assess the impairment of certain long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite useful lives  at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as of december   in our judgment  there is no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenues our revenues have been classified into three broad product families for the years ended december    and  and are presented in the following table revenues in thousands years ended december  increase decrease in years vs 
vs 
product family s s s s s s mobile handheld computer products   n a mobile peripheral products data collection connectivity serial interface oem embedded products total our mobile handheld computer product revenues in increased by million from mobile handheld computer product revenues in we began shipping our first mobile handheld computer  the somo  to customers in our distribution channel in the second quarter of in the third quarter of  we completed our objectives of ramping up production and fully stocking our distribution channel to enable the commencement of widespread customer evaluation  qualification  and deployment 
we began offering windows mobile classic and multiple language support for the somo in the second quarter of giving customers a choice of operating systems and languages to best fit their needs 
we have also introduced the somo model rx with an antimicrobial case for the healthcare market to reduce the risk of the spread of bacteria from the use of handheld devices in a healthcare environment  and the somo model dx without bluetooth or wireless lan for high security environments 
increased revenues for our mobile handheld computer products in reflect higher sales volumes due to a growing customer base with larger average unit deployments  and due to the fact that we did not start recognizing revenue for these products until the second quarter of our data collection product revenues in decreased by million from data collection revenues in the decrease was due to a decline of million in sales of our compactflash in hand scan card product  a decline of million in sales of our cordless hand scanner  and a decline million in reduced sales of our cordless ring scanner and our sdio in hand scan card 
data collection revenues in were slowed in the first quarter but began to recover in the second quarter due in part to delayed availability of new handheld computer models originally announced by a major handheld computer manufacturer in the third quarter of  which did not begin shipping until february such announcements and delayed timing of product availability typically slow customer deployments of our peripheral products because of the time needed by customers to evaluate or adopt the new handheld computer models 
following this revenue recovery was the fourth quarter of  in which data collection product sales were adversely affected by the worldwide economic slowdown 

table of contents our data collection product revenues in increased by million from data collection revenues in record quarterly data collection revenues in the first half of were slowed in the second half of due in part to an announcement by a major handheld computer manufacturer of new handheld models for the consumer market 
such announcements typically slow customer deployments of our peripheral products because of the time needed by customers to evaluate or adopt new handheld models 
overall growth in in our data collections revenues compared to was due to both our efforts in developing programs such as our vertical industry partners program  and a recovery in the first half of from adverse market conditions that existed in we are dependent upon vars  integrators and developers of third party software applications to supply vertical application software that uses the computers and peripheral products that we manufacture or support  and we have developed programs such as our vertical industry partners program to encourage vars  integrators and developers of such applications to do so 
overall growth in data collection revenues for reflects in part the growth in availability and deployment of software applications by businesses 
the primary contributor to growth in data collection product revenues in was our cordless hand scanner product which had revenue increases of million 
additional increases in data collection revenues in were million from increased sales of our primary data collection product  our compactflash in hand scan card  million from increased sales of our cordless ring scanner  and increased sales of our sdio in hand scan card  partially offset by declines in revenues of discontinued scanning products 
our connectivity product revenues for the three years presented in the above table consist of ethernet plug in cards  modems  and accessory products including our mobile power pack  adapters and cables 
connectivity product revenues in decreased by million from connectivity product revenues in the decrease was due to a decline of million from reduced sales of our modem plug in products and a decline of million from reduced sales of our ethernet plug in products 
connectivity product revenues decreased by million in from connectivity product revenues in connectivity product revenue declines in of million were from reduced sales of our modem plug in products and million from reduced sales of our ethernet plug in products 
additional declines in were from reduced sales of our accessory products including our mobile power pack  and our cordless gps receiver with navigation kit which was discontinued in overall connectivity product revenues have declined in the periods presented  reflecting a trend of year over year reductions in corporate deployments of these wired connection solutions 
our serial interface product revenues declined in by million from revenues in  and in declined by million from revenues in half of the decline in was from lower sales of our compactflash serial card products 
additional declines in were due to lower sales of our standard serial pc card products and cordless bluetooth serial adapter product 
serial interface product revenue declines of million in were due to reduced sales of our standard serial pc card products 
our standard serial pc card products are primarily sold to connect peripheral devices or other electronic equipment to notebook computers 
additional revenue declines in were from lower sales of our compactflash card products compared to overall serial product revenues have declined in the periods presented  continuing a trend reflecting the gradual replacement of serial technology with usb and other newer connection technologies 

table of contents our oem embedded product revenues in increased overall by million  compared to a decrease of million in within our oem products family  our bluetooth module revenues increased million in  compared to a decrease of million in the bluetooth module revenue increase in was due to a recovery in market conditions that existed in early  and last buy purchases of bluetooth modules in the latter half of in the first quarter of our oem customers in the industrial ruggedized market segment experienced pronounced increased competition due to a short term aggressive price discounting begun in the fourth quarter by a major competitor  a trend which adversely affected our related bluetooth module revenues in the first quarter of  but improved steadily in the following quarters of and throughout  following cessation of the aggressive discounting by the competitor 
our wireless lan product revenues in increased by million  compared to a decline of million in  we began classifying our wireless lan plug in card and bluetooth plug in card revenues within the oem embedded products family to reflect the beginning of a shift in the customer base to oem customers within our oem embedded products group  whereas sales of these products in and earlier were primarily driven by non oem customers 
revenues of our wireless lan products in reflect higher volumes of sales to customers within the oem customer group  whereas revenue declines in in our wireless lan plug in cards reflect the availability to non oem customers of this wireless technology already built in by handheld computer manufacturers 
our bluetooth plug in product revenues declined million in and million in  reflecting lower overall requirements for these products by our oem customer group and the availability of this wireless technology already built into handheld computers to our non oem customers 
gross margins gross margin for was percent of revenues compared to gross margins of percent in years and reductions in overall margins in are due primarily to discounts we granted on volume purchases of our bluetooth modules by customers in our oem embedded business segment  and increased sales of our mobile handheld computer which began shipping late in the second quarter of margins on our mobile handheld computer products are currently below our average product margins 
margins in reflect overall margin improvements in data collection products offset by lower than average margins on our mobile handheld computer which began shipping late in the second quarter of we generally price our products as a markup from our cost  and we offer discount pricing for higher volume purchases 
we anticipate our margins will continue to be within a couple of percentage points of the gross margins in research and development expense research and development expense in was million  a decrease of percent from research and development expense in of million 
research and development expense in decreased by percent from research and development expense in of million 
decreases of million in were attributable to the costs incurred in the first quarter of related to the development of our somo mobile handheld computer  the development of which was begun in the fourth quarter of  with the majority of the development expense concluded by the end of the first quarter of additional decreases in of million were from reductions in consulting and professional fees related to fewer projects requiring the use of external technical expertise  and from reductions in equipment costs due to higher amounts of depreciation expense related to capitalized tooling in the first quarter of reductions in totaling million were from reduced equipment costs and consulting and professional fees  and were partially offset by increases in personnel costs as we staffed in house expertise for technical skills formally sourced to outside consulting and professional service providers 
we will continue to monitor our research and development expense in response to the current economic conditions 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in was million  an increase of percent compared to sales and marketing expense in of million 
sales and marketing expense in increased by percent compared to sales and marketing expense in of million 
increases in were primarily from increased personnel costs of million due to the additions of key personnel beginning in the second quarter of  including our senior vp of sales marketing  and additional salespersons in north america to begin selling our new somo mobile handheld computer  which began shipping late in the second quarter of  and from expenses relating to the recruitment and development of new third party channel partners 
additional increases in were from higher levels of advertising and promotional expenses  offset by reductions in outside services and travel expenses 
increases in personnel costs of million in were due to the sales and marketing initiatives described above 
additional increases were from increased travel expenses related to the additions of staff members to the sales team 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions of million from lower levels of advertising and promotional expenses 
we will continue to monitor our sales and marketing expense in response to the current economic conditions 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in was million  a decrease of percent compared to general and administrative expense of million in general and administrative expense in was million  an increase of percent compared to general and administrative expense in decreases in were primarily from reduced stock based compensation expenses as older grants with higher valuations compared to more current grants  became fully expensed 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher overall occupancy related costs compared to increases in were primarily from higher equipment expense as we began to depreciate the costs of capitalized leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures related to our new corporate headquarters as of january  and higher overall occupancy related costs compared to the prior year 
we will continue to monitor our general and administrative expense in response to the current economic conditions 
amortization of intangibles in july we acquired a patent which covers the design and functioning of plug in bar code scanners  bar code imagers  and radio frequency identification products 
the patent was purchased for  and has been capitalized as an intangible asset 
the patent is being amortized on a straight line basis over a ten year period 
intangible assets of  remaining from a prior acquisition in october consist of developed software and technology with estimated lives at the time of acquisition of years 
at december   a licensing agreement with a book value of  was reclassified as an intangible asset and was amortized over its remaining life of three years ending in december total amortization charges in for all acquired intangibles were  compared to  in  and  in the lower annual amortization charges are due to components of intangible property becoming fully amortized

we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results  and we anticipate such fluctuations to continue in the future 
we generally ship orders as received and therefore quarterly revenue and operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of the quarter 
operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as the demand for our products  the size and timing of customer orders  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  product mix  timing of software enhancements  changes in the level of operating expenses  and competitive conditions in the industry 
because our staffing and other operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue  a substantial portion of which is not typically generated until the end of each quarter  delays in the receipt of orders can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we were unprofitable in each of the quarters in fiscal years  and we were profitable in two quarters in  but unprofitable for fiscal year fiscal year was the first profitable year in our history  but only to the extent of  prior to  we incurred significant operating losses in each financial period since our inception

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to invested cash 
our cash is invested in short term money market investments backed by us treasury notes and other investments that mature within one year and whose principal is not subject to market rate fluctuations 
accordingly  interest rate declines would adversely affect our interest income but would not affect the carrying value of our cash investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our cash investments during the quarter ended december   a decline of in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our quarterly interest income 
our bank credit line facilities of up to million have variable interest rates based upon the greater of either the lender s prime rate plus  or  for both the domestic line up to million and the international line up to million 
accordingly  interest rate increases would increase our interest expense on our outstanding credit line balances 
we utilized only a portion our credit line facility during the last three quarters of in the first quarter of and in each quarter of fiscal year we utilized the credit line facility only at the end of the quarter and therefore did not subject ourselves to significant interest rate exposure in such quarters 
based on a sensitivity analysis  an increase of in the interest rate would increase our borrowing costs by  for each million of borrowings  if outstanding for the entire year  against our bank credit facility or a maximum of  if we utilized our entire credit line 
the credit line agreement also specifies a fixed collateral handling fee of per month on the outstanding balances 
foreign currency risk a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we require our european distributors to purchase our products in euros  we pay the expenses of our european employees in euros and british pounds  and we may enter into selected future purchase commitments with foreign suppliers that may be paid in the local currency of the supplier 
we hedge a significant portion of our european receivables balance denominated in euros to reduce the foreign currency risk associated with these assets  and we have not been subject to significant losses from material foreign currency fluctuations 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our net foreign currency denominated assets and subsidiary expenses at the beginning  during and at the end of the quarter ended december   an adverse change of in exchange rates would result in an increase in our net loss for the third quarter of approximately  if left unprotected 
for the fourth quarter of the total net adjustment for the effects of changes in foreign currency on cash balances  collections  payables  and derivatives was a net loss of  we will continue to monitor  assess  and mitigate through hedging activities  the risk associated with these exposures
