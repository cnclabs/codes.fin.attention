critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  income or loss from operations and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include stock option accounting  accounting for income taxes  and valuation and evaluating impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of director and employee stock options 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected terms of the options and employee stock purchase plan rights are based on evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury rates at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at grant date 
volatility is based on historical and expected future volatility of the company s stock 
the company has not historically issued any dividends and does not expect to in the future 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of the grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
if factors change we may employ different assumptions in the calculation of compensation expense 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board asc  under which  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of asc in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
the company had us federal and state net operating loss nol carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively  which expire in fiscal years to the company has recently completed an internal revenue code section analysis of the loss carry forwards and has determined that all of the company s loss carry forwards are utilizable and not restricted under section at september   all of the company s net deferred tax assets  which consisted primarily of net operating losses  were offset with a valuation allowance  which amounted to approximately million 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reversed a portion of its valuation allowance in consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  including our historical operating results  current financial condition  and potential future taxable income 
our future potential taxable income was evaluated based primarily on anticipated operating results for fiscal years through we determined that projecting operating results beyond involves substantial uncertainty and we discounted forecasts beyond as a basis to support our deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter resulted in a non cash income tax benefit of approximately million 
at september  the company continues to record a valuation allowance of approximately million against its remaining deferred tax assets 
we will continue to assess the assumptions used to determine the amount of our valuation allowance and may adjust the valuation allowance in future periods based on changes in assumptions of estimated future income and other factors 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  we would record an income tax benefit in the period the valuation allowance is reduced 
if the valuation allowance is increased  we would record additional income tax expense 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded a deferred income tax expense of  for the book and income tax basis difference in goodwill on acquisitions 
this deferred income tax expense was netted against the deferred tax benefit resulting from the reduction in the valuation allowance 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state jurisdictions 
based on its evaluation  the company has concluded that it has no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
with limited exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal and state income tax examinations for fiscal years ending prior in the company changed its fiscal year to september impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in the last quarter of each year  or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill primarily utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  and estimated expansion of the fiber to the premise market 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
this test for the period ended september  resulted in no change to goodwill from the prior period 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred and when the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow attributed to such assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
no impairment of long lived assets has occurred during the years ended september  or september   respectively
