overview during  net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to  from  in  a increase 
total interest income increased from  in to  in  a increase 
interest expense for totaled  a increase from  in net income in was  compared to  in the decrease in net income was primarily due to a write down of  taken in the third quarter on investments in three series of preferred stock issued by federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac held by the company  as a result of the appointment of the federal housing finance agency as conservator over fannie mae and freddie mac 
in  the company recorded a provision for loan losses of  an increase from the  provision made in the bank and  as a result  the company  have not been immune to the impact of the economic downturn in the united states during while  due to conservative lending decisions  the bank has no exposure to the credit issues affecting the sub prime residential mortgage market  the economic slowdown resulted in the necessity of our increasing our reserve for loan losses in  as noted above  primarily due to delinquency in our indirect automobile portfolio combined with adjustments we made to the risk factors in our calculation of required loan loss reserves 
in addition to the fannie mae and freddie mac losses noted above  the economic downturn also resulted in the necessity of the bank taking in our first oreo other real estate owned property on a defaulted mortgage since despite the sharp economic downturn and these events  we realized net income of  for  remained well capitalized and did not need to apply for any funding from the us department of treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp 
in  the bank saw continued growth in the loan portfolio 
the loan portfolio increased by  primarily due to increases in commercial and residential mortgage loans 
all per share amounts throughout this report have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to a stock dividend paid on january  and to a stock dividend paid on january  comparison of results of operations for the years ended december   and general

net interest income 
the primary component of the company s net income is its net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income producing assets 
net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
net interest income  divided by average interest earning assets  represents the company s net interest margin 
net interest income is affected by the mix of loans in the bank s loan portfolio 
currently a majority of the bank s loans are residential and commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate and indirect automobile loans secured by automobiles 
in  the bank reduced its portfolio of above market rate savings products and continued to direct its efforts to increase higher yielding commercial loans 
this strategy produced significant increases in the bank s commercial loan portfolio 
because mortgage lending decisions are based on conservative lending policies the company has no exposure to the credit issues affecting the sub prime residential mortgage market 
at the same time  we have reduced our exposure to lower yielding indirect automobile loans 
consolidated net interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the  increase for the most recent year was primarily due to an increase in loan income partially offset by decreases in interest income on securities and increases in interest expense on long term borrowings

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements 
the bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of any conditions of the contracts 
loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts  fixed expiration dates  and may require payment of a fee 
lines of credit generally have variable interest rates 
many of the loan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  accordingly  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral or other security obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
collateral held varies but may include deposits held in financial institutions  us treasury securities  other marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  personal residences  income producing commercial properties  and land under development 
personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those commitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the commitment 
loan commitments  lines of credit  and letters of credit are made on the same terms  including collateral  as outstanding loans 
as of december   the bank has accrued  for unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  which is included in other liabilities 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the bank s asset liability and risk management committee oversees the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of the committee is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
the company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategies in its management of interest rate risk 
the primary tool used by the committee to monitor interest rate risk is a gap report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period 
these efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the company as well as the asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
the following table sets forth the bank s interest rate sensitivity at december  months over to months over through years over years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks federal funds and overnight deposits securities loans fixed assets other assets total assets liabilities demand deposit accounts now accounts money market deposit accounts savings accounts ira accounts certificates of deposit other liabilities junior subordinated debenture stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a of total assets the foregoing analysis assumes that the bank s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity 
mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity 
certificates of deposit and ira accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity 
now savings accounts are assumed to reprice at within three months although it is the company s experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates 
in addition to gap analysis  the bank utilizes a simulation model to quantify the effect a hypothetical immediate plus or minus basis point change in rates would have on net interest income and the economic value of equity 
the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investments as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model and  in the bank s experience  the changes historically realized have been narrower than those projected by the model 
however  the bank believes that the model is a prudent forecasting tool 
as of december   the model produced the following sensitivity profile for net interest income and the economic value of equity 
immediate change in rates basis points basis points basis points basis points change in net interest income change in economic value of equity liquidity and capital resources the company currently has no business other than that of the bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the bank 
the bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the bank s principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income  deposits from its primary market area  principal and interest payments on loans  interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities 
its principal funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans and the payment of maturing deposits 
deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the bank s lending and investment activities 
the bank also uses borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta to supplement deposits  residential and small business lending  and to meet specific and anticipated needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which are cash on hand  amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold and money market mutual funds 
the levels of such assets are dependent on the bank s operating financing and investment activities at any given time 
the variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows 
cash and cash equivalents cash due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  and federal funds sold  as of december   totaled  an increase of  or  from the december  total of  most of this increase was due to federal funds sold with a lesser increase in interest bearing deposits in fhlb but was offset by a decrease in cash and due from banks 
as of december   the bank was permitted to draw on a million line of credit from the fhlb of atlanta 
borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the bank s residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of us government and agency securities 
as of december   a million long term convertible advance was outstanding under this line 
there was also a million convertible advance callable monthly and with a final maturity of november  there was a million convertible advance settled july  with a final maturity of july  this advance has a rate of interest and is callable quarterly  starting july  there was a million convertible advance taken out august  which has a final maturity of august  this advance has a rate of interest and is callable quarterly  starting august  in addition the bank has unsecured lines of credit totaling million from a commercial bank on which there is no outstanding balances at december  furthermore  on september   the company issued  of its junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures to glen burnie statutory trust i  a connecticut statutory trust wholly owned by the company 
the trust  in turn  issued  of its capital securities to institutional investors 
the debentures are scheduled to mature on september   unless called by the company not earlier than september  as of december   the full  was outstanding 
federal banking regulations require the company and the bank to maintain specified levels of capital 
at december   the company was in compliance with these requirements with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and total risk based capital ratio of 
at december   the bank met the criteria for designation as a well capitalized depository institution under fdic regulations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  starting on page f and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed there  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from the company s estimates 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the company s financial statements  including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process allowance for credit losses 
the bank s allowance for credit losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur  including historical losses as an indicator of future losses  fair market value of collateral  and various general or industry or geographic specific economic events 
the use of these estimates and values is inherently subjective and the actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see allowance for credit losses under item business of this annual report 
accrued taxes 
management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
income taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position
