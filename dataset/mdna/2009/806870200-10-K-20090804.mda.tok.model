item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview schmitt industries  inc designs  manufactures and markets computer controlled vibration detection and balancing equipment the balancer segment to the worldwide machine tool industry and  through its wholly owned subsidiary  schmitt measurement systems  inc  precision laser based surface measurement products  laser based distance measurement products and ultrasonic measurement systems the measurement segment for a variety of industrial applications worldwide 
the company sells and markets its products in europe through its wholly owned subsidiary  schmitt europe ltd 
sel located in the united kingdom 
the company is organized into two operating segments the balancer segment and the measurement segment 
for the year ended may  fiscal  total sales decreased million or to million from million in the year ended may  fiscal 
balancer segment sales focus throughout the world on end users  rebuilders and original equipment manufacturers of grinding machines with the target geographic markets in north america  asia and europe 
balancer sales decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the fiscal decrease in worldwide balancer sales is due to lower volumes of shipments as the worldwide automotive industry has been severely impacted by the global economic downturn 
the measurement segment product line consists of both laser based light scatter and distance measurement and dimensional sizing products 
total measurement sales decreased  or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the lower volumes of shipments of surface measurement products to disk drive and silicon wafer manufacturers 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed its acquisition of xtero datacom  inc xtero 
the company acquired xtero s business including its patented technologies that utilize ultrasonic measurement systems to remotely measure and report via satellite to a secure website the capacity and volumes of large chemical storage tanks anywhere in the world 
this acquisition partially resulted in higher research and development costs of  during fiscal these higher expenses negatively impacted operating results during fiscal net loss was million or per fully diluted share for the year ended may  as compared to net income of million or per fully diluted share for the year ended may  earnings per share for fiscal as compared to the prior year were also negatively impacted due to the issuance of  shares of common stock used in connection with the acquisition of xtero during the third quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for sales and billing for freight charges upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price with a reasonable assurance of collection  passage of title to the customer as indicated by shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations  pursuant to the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december for sales to all customers  including manufacturer representatives  distributors or their third party customers  these criteria are met at the time product is shipped 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
in addition  judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectibility is reasonable assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits for all customers are established based upon several factors  including but not limited to financial condition and stability  payment history  published credit reports and use of credit references 
on a monthly basis  management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
this review includes accounts receivable agings  other operating trends and relevant business conditions  including general economic factors  as they relate to the company s domestic and international customers 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all of the information presently available 
inventories as a designer and manufacturer of high technology systems  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to record inventory write downs when conditions exist that suggest our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based upon a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis 
deferred taxes the company applies the asset and liability method in recording income taxes  under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined  based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws 
additionally  deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management continues to review the level of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s future operations will produce sufficient earnings so that the deferred tax assets can be fully utilized 
intangible assets there is a periodic review of intangible and other long lived assets for impairment 
this review consists of the analysis of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability is determined by comparing the forecasted future undiscounted net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using the appropriate assumptions and projections at the time  to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the carrying value is determined to be in excess of future operating cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets
