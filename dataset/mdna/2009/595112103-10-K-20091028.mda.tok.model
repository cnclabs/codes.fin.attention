this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended september  all period references are to the company s fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated 
the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the thursday closest to august all tabular dollar amounts are in millions 
the company s fiscal  which ended on september   contained weeks and its fiscal and fiscal both contained weeks 
all production data includes production of the company and its consolidated joint ventures and the company s supply from inotera 
overview the company is a global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor devices  principally dram and nand flash memory 
in addition the company manufactures cmos image sensor products under a wafer foundry arrangement 
the company operates in two reportable segments memory and imaging 
its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers  workstations  network servers  mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards  usb storage devices  digital still cameras  mp players and in automotive applications 
the company markets its products through its internal sales force  independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world 
the company s success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified portfolio of semiconductor products  efficient utilization of the company s manufacturing infrastructure  successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development investments 
the company has made significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology that is implemented in its worldwide manufacturing facilities and through its joint ventures to enable the production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs 
the company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as its leading edge line width process technology and innovative array architecture 
the company continues to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics  such as higher data transfer rates  reduced package size  lower power consumption and increased memory density 
to leverage its significant investments in research and development  the company has formed various strategic joint ventures under which the costs of developing memory product and process technologies are shared with its joint venture partners 
in addition  from time to time  the company has also sold and or licensed technology to other parties 
the company is pursuing additional opportunities to recover its investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements 
the semiconductor memory industry is experiencing a severe downturn due to a significant oversupply of products 
the downturn has been exacerbated by global economic conditions which have adversely affected demand for semiconductor memory products 
average selling prices per gigabit for the company s dram and nand flash products declined and  respectively  for as compared to  after declining and  respectively  for as compared to  and declining and  respectively  for as compared to these declines significantly outpaced the long term historical pricing trend 
as a result of these market conditions  the company and other semiconductor memory manufacturers reported substantial losses in recent periods 
the company reported a net loss of billion for after reporting net losses of billion for and million for in response to adverse market conditions  the company initiated restructure plans in  primarily within the company s memory segment 
in the first quarter of  im flash  a joint venture between the company and intel corporation  terminated its agreement with the company to obtain nand flash memory supply from the company s boise facility  reducing the company s nand flash production by approximately  mm wafers per month 
the company and intel also agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of nand flash production at im flash s singapore wafer fabrication facility 
in addition  the company phased out all remaining mm dram wafer manufacturing operations at its boise  idaho  facility in the second half of inotera memories  inc inotera in the first quarter of  the company acquired a ownership interest in inotera  a publicly traded entity in taiwan  from qimonda ag qimonda for million 
the interest in inotera was acquired for cash  a portion of which was funded from loan proceeds of million received from nan ya plastics corporation and million received from inotera 
nan ya plastics is an affiliate of nanya technology corporation nanya  a then shareholder in inotera 
the loans were recorded at their fair values which reflect an aggregate discount of million from their face amounts 
this aggregate discount was recorded as a reduction of the company s basis in its investment in inotera 
the company also capitalized million of costs and other fees incurred in connection with the acquisition 
as a result of the above transactions  the initial carrying value of the company s investment in inotera was million 
on august   inotera issued shares in a public offering for approximately million that reduced the company and nanya s ownership in inotera to and  respectively 
as a result of inotera s public offering  the company will recognize a gain of million in the first quarter of in connection with the acquisition of the shares in inotera  the company and nanya entered into a supply agreement with inotera the inotera supply agreement pursuant to which inotera will sell trench and stack dram products to the company and nanya 
the company has rights and obligations to purchase up to of inotera s wafer production capacity 
inotera s actual wafer production will vary from time to time based on market and other conditions 
inotera s trench production is expected to transition to the company s stack process technology 
inotera charges the company and nanya for a portion of the costs associated with its underutilized capacity  if any 
the cost to the company of wafers purchased under the inotera supply agreement is based on a margin sharing formula among the company  nanya and inotera 
under such formula  all parties manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera  as well as the company s and nanya s selling prices for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera  are considered in determining costs for wafers from inotera 
under the inotera supply agreement 
the company s purchase obligation includes purchasing inotera s trench dram capacity less any trench dram products sold to qimonda pursuant to a separate supply agreement between inotera and qimonda the qimonda supply agreement 
under the qimonda supply agreement  qimonda was obligated to purchase trench dram products resulting from wafers started for it by inotera through july in accordance with a ramp down schedule specified in the qimonda supply agreement 
in the second quarter of  qimonda filed for bankruptcy protection and defaulted on its obligations to purchase products from inotera 
pursuant to the company s obligations under the inotera supply agreement  the company recorded million of charges to cost of goods sold in for underutilized capacity 
the company s results of operations for also include losses of million for the company s share of inotera s losses from the acquisition date through the second calendar quarter of the company accounts for its interest in inotera under the equity method and does not consolidate inotera 
the company recognizes its share of earnings or losses from inotera for a period that lags the company s fiscal periods by two months 
as of september   the company had recorded million to accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for cumulative translation adjustments for its investment in inotera 
during the third quarter of  the company received million from inotera pursuant to the terms of a technology transfer agreement 
as of september   the carrying value of the company s equity investment in inotera was million
