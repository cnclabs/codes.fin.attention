item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
seasonality our results of operations have historically been affected by seasonal patterns in both traffic to our web properties and advertising demand 
many of our users are students who utilize our web properties as reference sources 
our traffic fluctuates with the academic school year  rising from january through may  falling to lower levels during the summer months  rising again in september through november  and falling again in december  coinciding with school breaks and the holiday season 
we expect traffic to our web properties to continue to fluctuate seasonally in the future 
this seasonal fluctuation in traffic results in a fluctuation in our quarterly revenues  since lower traffic on our web properties translates into fewer users clicking on or viewing the advertisements on our web properties

improve access and enhance the user experience over time  we plan to enhance the user experience for visitors to our properties and further differentiate them from other online services offering answers  including functionality  usability  performance  and access from various platforms  including mobile access

table of contents content license agreements we license content under written agreements with recognized publishers of information 
these agreements are generally for fixed periods  mostly ranging from one year and more  renewable by consent of the parties  and entitle us to provide the licensed information to our end users through our services in return for a fixed amount payable over the life of the agreement  either in a lump sum up front or payable over the course of a fixed schedule  either monthly  quarterly or annually 
we also provide content we license at no cost  content publicly available from the web and content we develop and author independently

technology research and development we devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new products and services  maintaining and enhancing existing products and services  expanding and improving our fundamental technology and strengthening our technological expertise 
in fiscal years and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on research and development of our products and services

our colocation facility  located in new jersey  is provided by netaccess corporation 
we plan to add a second colocation site during the first half of in order to provide redundancy of web operations at the data center level 
until such time  our operations are centered in one single data center facility 
prior to launching our colocation facility in  we outsourced our web hosting to terremark worldwide  inc competition we face significant competition from a wide variety of web properties 
question and answer sites  such as yahoo answers owned by yahoo  askville owned by amazon  live qna owned by microsoft  yedda owned by aol  answerbag

com and wikipedia 
org  compete with answers 
com 
other competitors of answers 
com include vertical industry specific web properties  such as bankrate 
com and webmd 
com 
since several companies operating traditional search engines  such as google  yahoo  microsoft  aol and ask 
com offer answers within their search services  they too can be viewed as competitors of our answers driven products  particularly in light of the fact that some search engines have begun putting snippets of useful answers at the top of many of their pages  in response to queries made by users 
nevertheless  search engines remain the greatest source of traffic arriving at our web properties 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive management experience  an employee base with more extensive experience  better geographic coverage  larger consumer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resource than we do 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or attracting and retaining users  then our competitive position and financial results could be adversely affected 

table of contents advertising relationships we obtain almost all of our advertising revenue through agreements with third party ad networks 
third party ad networks generally compensate us by paying us a portion of the revenue they earn from ads that appear on our web properties 
our primary ad network partner  google adsense  accounted for approximately of our total revenue in google adsense 
in january  we entered into the google services agreement gsa governing our participation in google adsense 
pursuant to the gsa  we display listings from google s network of advertisers on our web properties 
there are two methods by which adsense advertisements are generated on our web properties adsense for search  or afs  and adsense for content  or afc 
in effect  the gsa positions google adsense as our most significant third party ad network 
in december  we amended the gsa in order to obtain google s permission to display image ads 
in september  we entered into a renewal of the gsa  thereby extending its term through january and improving our revenue share percentage 
google may terminate the gsa with no advance notice for any of the following reasons our breach of certain prohibited actions including  among other things editing or modifying the order of search results  redirecting end users  producing or distributing any software which prevents the display of ads by google  modifying  adapting or otherwise attempting to obtain source code from google technology  content  software and documentation or engaging in any action or practice that reflects poorly on google or otherwise disparages or devalues google s reputation or goodwill  our breach of the grant of a license to us by google of certain trade names  trademarks  service marks  logos  domain names and other distinctive brand features of google  our breach of the confidentiality provisions of the gsa  our breach of the exclusivity provisions of the gsa  or our material breach of the gsa more than two times  irrespective of any cure to such breaches

table of contents direct ad sales in an effort to improve monetization  in the fourth quarter of  we began marketing directly to advertisers and generating additional advertising revenue through an in house team of direct ads salespeople 
however  at the end of the second quarter of we decided to suspend this business initiative  and by the end of the third quarter of we no longer employed a direct sales staff 
we initially saw promise in this area  with the belief that our web properties would see rpm increases as a result of direct ad sales 
in the fourth quarter of  the sales force generated thousand of direct ad revenue 
however  direct ad revenue in was disappointing  with revenue in the first quarter amounting to thousand and in the second quarter to thousand 
at the end of the second quarter of  we came to the belief that the horizontal  educational  reference nature of www

com made direct ads less compelling for this web property 
while we viewed wikianswers 
com as having the potential to successfully implement a direct ad sales strategy  we decided not to pursue that strategy and to instead focus on selling ads through advertising networks  primarily google adsense 
this decision allowed us to focus on our core competency growing the wikianswers community  growing traffic to our web properties and monetizing via google adsense and other ad networks 
marketing to enhance the answers brands  we are pursuing a brand development strategy that includes direct marketing  word of mouth marketing  public relations efforts and licensing arrangements 
word of mouth marketing we benefit from word of mouth advertising when users share their positive experience using our answer engine services with friends  colleagues  family  and others 
we work to encourage the practice by adding features that make it simple to link to our web properties or send an e mail with information from our web properties  by targeting bloggers which may include links from their blogs to our web properties  and by working with computer user groups and newsletter publishers  all of whom share new technologies with constituents

public relations efforts over the years  we have received multiple favorable reviews from numerous publications including usa today  the washington post  the wall street journal  forbes and pc magazine and plan on continuing our public relations efforts with outreach  speaking opportunities  press releases  interviews and briefings 
employees at february   we had employees  of which were full time employees and were part time employees 
as of such date  employees were located in our office in jerusalem  employees were based in the united states 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 

table of contents intellectual property we regard our domain names  patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade dress  trade secrets  proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success  and we rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners  and others to protect our proprietary rights 
the united states patent and trademark office has granted us four united states patents  the israeli patent office has granted us one patent 
we have one patent pending in the united states and a corresponding patent pending under the patent cooperation treaty 
the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions  and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that any patent application filed by us will result in a patent being issued or that our issued patents  and any patents that may be issued in the future  will afford adequate protection against competitors with similar technology 
we similarly face the risk that any patents issued to us might be infringed or designed around by others 
while we rely on patent and other intellectual property laws to protect our technology  we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining our market position 
we enter into confidentiality agreements  as appropriate  with our employees  consultants and customers  and otherwise seek to control access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
these measures  however  afford only limited protection 
there is no guarantee that these safeguards will protect our technology and other valuable competitive information from being used by competitors 
we have applied for  or have been assigned by third parties  numerous domain names and have filed applications for a number of trademarks by us governmental authorities

from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we have been  and we expect to continue to be  subject to claims of alleged infringement of copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
these claims and any resultant litigation  should it occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages 
in addition  even if we prevail  litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and attention 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims  unless we are able to enter into license agreements with the third parties making these claims 

table of contents government regulation the manner in which existing laws regulating the internet  in general  and how they relate to our business in particular  is unclear or unsettled in many cases 
such uncertainty arises under existing laws regulating matters  including user privacy  defamation  pricing  advertising  taxation  gambling  sweepstakes  promotions  content regulation  quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement 
nevertheless  to resolve some of the current legal uncertainty  we expect the courts to interpret these laws and regulations and such rulings may be applicable to our activities 
such rulings could generally dampen the growth in use of the internet and could potentially expose us to substantial liability  including significant expenses necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
several fairly recent us federal laws that could have an impact on our business include  among others the digital millennium copyright act is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others 
portions of the communications decency act are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content 
the child s online protection act  or copa  the children s online privacy protection act  or coppa and the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end exploitation of children today act  are intended to restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors 
the protection of children from sexual predators act requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances 
the can spam act is intended to regulate spam and create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually oriented material and emails containing fraudulent headers 
likewise  other laws could have an impact on our business 
under the uk data protection act and the european union data protection directive  a failure to ensure that personal information is accurate and secure or a transfer of personal information to a country without adequate privacy protections could result in criminal or civil penalties 
such legislation may impose significant additional costs on our business or subject us to additional liabilities 
we post our privacy policy and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data 
any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy  us federal trade commission requirements or other domestic or international privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies  that could potentially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in this regard  there are a large number of legislative proposals before the european union  as well as before the united states congress and various state legislative bodies  regarding privacy issues related to our business 
it is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted  and certain proposals  if adopted  could harm our business operations 
for example  decreases in usage of our services could be caused by  among other possible provisions  the required use of disclaimers or other requirements before users can utilize our services 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws 
we might unintentionally violate such laws  such laws may be modified and new laws may be enacted in the future 
any such developments could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be subject to legal liability for specific types of online services we provide 
we direct users to a wide variety of services that enable individuals to exchange information  conduct business and engage in various online activities on an international basis 
the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the united states and in other countries 
claims may be threatened against us for aiding and abetting defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of information to which we provide links or that may be posted online 

table of contents operations in israel the law for the encouragement of capital investments  the investments law  provides that upon application to the investment center of the ministry of industry  commerce and employment of the state of israel  or the investment center  a proposed capital investment in eligible capital expenditures may be designated as an approved enterprise 
each certificate of approval for an approved enterprise relates to a specific investment program delineated both by its financial scope  including its capital sources  and by its physical characteristics  such as the equipment to be purchased and utilized under the program 
the tax benefits derived from any certificate of approval relate only to taxable income derived from growth in manufacturing revenues attributable to the specific approved enterprise 
if a company has more than one approval or only a portion of its capital investments are approved  its effective tax rate is the result of a weighted combination of the applicable rates 
taxable income of a company derived from an approved enterprise is subject to tax at the maximum rate of  rather than the current rate of  for the benefit period the benefit period 
the benefit period is ordinarily years  beginning with the year in which the approved enterprise first generates taxable income  and is limited to years from when production begins or years from the date of approval  whichever is earlier 
a company owning an approved enterprise may elect to receive an alternative package of benefits  which allows the company to receive tax exemptions rather than grants 
under the alternative package  the company s undistributed income derived from an approved enterprise will be exempt from tax for a period of between and years from the first year of taxable income  depending on the geographic location of the approved enterprise within israel  and the company will be eligible for the tax benefits under the investment law for the remainder of the benefit period  if any 
the benefits available to an approved enterprise are conditional upon compliance with the conditions stipulated in the investment law and related regulations and the criteria described in the specific certificate of approval 
if a company violates these conditions  in whole or in part  it would be required to refund the amount of tax benefits and any grants received  linked to the israeli consumer price index  plus interest 
on april   amendment no 
to the investment law became effective the amendment and has changed several provisions of the investment law  mainly in respect of the alternative package 
the amendment sets forth the scope of enterprises which may qualify as a beneficiary enterprise under the amendment  the designation is beneficiary enterprise rather than approved enterprise by setting forth criteria for qualification of a company 
additionally  the amendment determined that companies operating under the alternative package no longer require investment center approval in order to qualify for tax benefits 
instead  this position will be incorporated as part of the regular tax audits of the israeli tax authorities the ita 
under the amendment  the year in which a company elects to commence its tax benefits is designated as the year of election year of election 
a company may choose its year of election by notifying the ita in its annual tax return or within twelve months after the end of the year of election  whichever is earlier  or by requesting a pre ruling from the ita no later than six months after the end of the year of election 
however  the investment law provides that terms and benefits included in any letter of approval which was granted prior to the effective date of the amendment  will remain subject to the provisions of the law as they were on the date of such approval 
therefore  our israeli subsidiary s gurunet israel ltd 
existing approved enterprise status will generally not be subject to the provisions of the amendment  while in order to receive further benefits  it will have to meet the amendment s requirements 
gurunet israel ltd  currently has two capital investment programs  both of which were granted approved enterprise status under the investment law prior to the amendment  ending december  and december   respectively 
qualifying income arising from our approved enterprise is tax free in israel under the alternative package of benefits described above for a period of years from the first year in which our israeli subsidiary generates taxable income from such approved enterprise  but not later than certain specified periods 
we have begun to generate taxable income for purposes of the investment law  and we have utilized these tax benefits beginning in in addition to our two existing capital investment programs  we intend to elect as our year of election for our second expansion under the amendment to the investment law

we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
factors that could cause such results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements include those set forth below 
risks relating to our business if search engines alter their algorithms or methods or otherwise restrict the flow of users visiting our web properties  our business and financial results could suffer 
search engines serve as the primary web entry point for most users in search of information  and our topic and answer pages often appear as one of the top links on the pages returned by search engines in response to users search queries 
as a result  we rely heavily on search engines for the overwhelming share of users visiting our web properties 
according to our internal estimates  traffic to our web properties originating from search engines during the fourth quarter of  excluding google directed definition link traffic  was approximately of the overall traffic to our web properties  the majority of which originated from google and  to a lesser but still significant extent  yahoo 
wikianswers 
com search engine traffic during the same period was even more significant  amounting to approximately of its overall traffic 
if our traffic from search engines declines for any reason  we would suffer a significant decline in overall traffic and revenue 
for example  in july  a search engine algorithm adjustment by google led to a drop in google directed traffic to answers 
com 
this adjustment reduced our overall traffic by approximately based on the average traffic directed to answers 
com from google for the week prior to the adjustment as compared to the week after 
as a result  our revenue declined proportionately 
in september  yahoo dropped our content from its search index  which led to a drop in our yahoo directed traffic 
this action was reversed within a week 
search engines  at any time and for any reason  could change their algorithms that direct search queries to our web properties or could restrict the flow of users visiting our web properties specifically 
in fact  as illustrated above  on occasion our web properties which both rely so heavily on search engine traffic have experienced decreases in traffic  and consequently in revenue  due to these search engine actions 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully react to these actions in the future and recover the lost traffic 
accordingly  a change in algorithms that search engines use to identify web pages towards which traffic will ultimately be directed  or a restriction on users visiting our web properties from the search engines  could cause a significant decrease in traffic and revenues  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

table of contents if the google services agreement gsa is terminated by google  we would have to seek an alternative provider of listings and advertisements  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
our business is dependent on the gsa  under which we obtain most of the advertisements displayed on our web properties and earn most of our ad revenues 
google may terminate the gsa with no advance notice if we take certain prohibited actions including  among other things o redirecting end users  producing or distributing any software which prevents the display of ads by google  o editing or modifying the order of search results  o modifying  adapting or otherwise attempting to obtain source code from google technology  content  software and documentation  or o engaging in any action or practice that reflects poorly on google or otherwise disparaging or devaluing google s reputation or goodwill  breach the grant of a license to us by google of certain trade names  trademarks  service marks  logos  domain names and other distinctive brand features of google  breach the confidentiality provisions of the gsa  breach the exclusivity provisions of the gsa  or materially breach the gsa more than two times  irrespective of any cure to such breaches 
the gsa is scheduled to expire on january   unless renewed upon mutual written consent 
google s termination of the gsa would result in our need to replace this relationship and obtain listings and advertisements from alternative providers  and we may not succeed in receiving equally favorable terms as those provided in the gsa 
termination of the gsa and our failure to replace it on equally favorable terms could result in a material reduction in our ad revenues and could adversely affect our business and financial results 
in addition  a renewal of the gsa in february on terms less favorable to us than the current terms  including the revenue share percentage  could result in a material reduction in our ad revenues and could adversely affect our business and financial results 
a downturn in the united states and global economic conditions could adversely affect the profitability of our business 
the us and global economies are currently experiencing a significant contraction  and it is expected that we will see further economic downturn in the immediate and near future 
this may result in fewer page views that result in commercial activities by our users  and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online advertising  thus having a significant negative impact on the rpms of both our web properties in and beyond 
a drop in rpm may result in a material reduction in our ad revenues which would adversely affect our business and financial results 
the failure of wikianswers 
com to grow in accordance with our expectations could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 
wikianswers 
com is currently our primary growth driver  and it exceeds answers 
com in both traffic and revenue 
our projections assume that the growth of wikianswers 
com will continue to be greater than that of answers 
com 
if  for whatever reason  wikianswers 
com fails to perform as well as we anticipate  and the growth we are experiencing decelerates significantly  falters or ceases  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
if internet users do not interact with wikianswers 
com frequently or if we fail to attract new users to the service  our business and financial results will suffer 
the success of wikianswers 
com is largely dependent upon users constantly visiting the site by asking questions  posting answers and improving upon both 
we have seen a very high correlation between growth in questions and answers and growth in the site s page views 
we need to attract users to visit the web property frequently and spend increasing amounts of time on the web property when they visit 
if we are unable to encourage users to interact more frequently with wikianswers 
com and to increase the amount of user generated content they provide  our ability to attract new users to the web property and increase the number of loyal users will be diminished and adversely affected 
as a result  our business and financial results will suffer  and we will not be able to grow our business as planned 

table of contents if we are unable to improve and maintain the quality of content being contributed to wikianswers 
com  and if we fail to fight vandalism the site has been experiencing  the web property will become less valuable to the users  less popular as a destination for obtaining answers to questions and its growth will be negatively affected  which in turn could adversely impact our financial results 
it is critical that we ensure that the quality of content being posted on wikianswers 
com  both questions and answers  is maintained to as high an extent as reasonable  and improved over time 
the better the quality of the content generated on the web property  the more valuable the web property will be for users in search of answers  as well as for search engines indexing the content to continue featuring it in their search engine result pages 
improved quality content should lead to stronger growth in the community size and will lessen the risk of a search engine s algorithm and or policy makers downgrading the rank of wikianswers 
com 
in addition  it is critical that we ward off vandals and eliminate vandalism on the web property to the greatest extent possible 
if we fail to maintain and improve the quality of the web property s content  the appeal of wikianswers 
com to users and search engines may diminish and the growth of the web property may be negatively affected  which in turn could cause our financial results to suffer 
if  in the interest of improving user experience and user satisfaction  we decide to decrease the number of ad elements displayed on our web properties  our advertising revenues will decline and our financial results will be adversely impacted 
we closely monitor the ratio between ad elements and actual content appearing on our web pages 
in the future we may decide that in order to enhance the user experience and increase user satisfaction  our pages should display fewer ad elements 
displaying less ad intensive web pages is likely to result in faster page load and offering more content per page is likely to appeal more to the user 
a better user experience may result in more stickiness on our web properties and a higher rate of user retention and return visits 
however  there is no assurance that reducing advertising on our web properties will result in better user retention and return visits and there can be no guarantee that the short term reduction in ad revenues will pay off in the long term in the form of increased traffic 
a decrease in the number of ad elements displayed on our web properties will result in a drop in rpm and advertising revenues which may not be recovered through higher traffic  thus having an adverse impact on our results of operations 
if we are unable to attract and retain dedicated volunteer supervisors for encouraging the community s expansion  our plans for growing wikianswers 
com may fail and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we benefit from the heavy involvement of a large group of external volunteer supervisors who are not employed by us and are not compensated for their site activity 
the volunteer supervisors  for their own personal motives and enjoyment  are involved in monitoring questions and answers in specific categories in an effort to help questions get answered quickly 
volunteers also help prevent vandalism  improve content consistency  encourage high quality contributions and identify potential new volunteers 
volunteers are also engaged in various community programs aimed at strengthening the community and contributors sense of connection to the site and the community at large and help instill a sense of camaraderie among users interested in various categories of wikianswers 
com 
as of december   the community enjoyed the benefit of over such supervisors 
if we are not able to attract enough volunteers  wikianswers 
com may suffer and the web property may become less attractive to users  which in turn will adversely affect the site s growth  our business and financial results 
alternatively  we may be forced to hire paid employees to engage in many of the initiatives that volunteers currently take upon themselves for their own personal pleasure and gratification  which  in turn  would increase the cost of maintaining and improving wikianswers 
com and adversely affect our financial results 
we benefit from google s directing of traffic to answers 
com through its definition link  and the loss of this source of traffic could reduce our ad revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 
approximately of our overall traffic during the fourth quarter of was directed to answers 
com by the definition link appearing on google s website result pages 
this traffic includes secondary pages viewed on answers 
com as a result of visitors arriving at the site via the definition performing additional searches 
the definition link traffic is the result of a unilateral decision by google to link certain definitions to answers 
com  and not any contractual relationship 
google may change these links at any time  in its sole discretion 
if google stops directing traffic to answers 
com through its definition link  we would experience a reduction in our traffic and the corresponding ad revenues  which would adversely affect our business and financial results 

table of contents components of our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth 
if we fail to effectively manage our growth  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have experienced rapid growth in our operations over the past several years  which has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management  operational and financial infrastructure 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  the quality of our products and services could suffer  which could negatively affect our brand and operating results 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
these systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources 
failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position 
we have a short operating history and a relatively new business model in an emerging and rapidly evolving market 
this makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risks that we will not continue to be successful and that our financial results could suffer 
there are two primary categories of internet advertising  pay per performance  or most commonly cost per click  or cpc  and pay per impression  or cost per  impressions  or cpm 
in the case of performance based advertising  the advertiser only pays when a user clicks on an ad  as opposed to viewing the ad  as in impression based advertising 
we first derived advertising revenue in the first quarter of  and we have only a short operating history with our cpc and cpm advertising model 
as a result  we have very little operating history to aid in assessing our future prospects 
also  we derive nearly all of our revenues from online advertising  which is an immature industry that has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history 
we will encounter risks and difficulties as a growing company in a new and rapidly evolving market 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties  which could materially harm our business and operating results 
we may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms  if at all  or without dilution to our stockholders 
we believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months  based on our current cash and cash equivalent levels and expected cash flow from operations 
further  in estimating our expected cash flow during the next twelve months  we have considered the current general economic downturn and its impact on our future revenue 
however  we may need or desire additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies  including to acquire businesses or technologies  improve and expand content on our web properties  otherwise respond to competitive pressures  and enhance our operating infrastructure 
if we decide to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  and are successful at raising such capital  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the weakness of the financial markets and the economic crisis 
for example  we experienced such financing difficulties during the course of our recent failed attempt to acquire lexico publishing group  llc and our ultimate abandonment of a follow on offering 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  when we desire them  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance our services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
new technologies could block internet ads  which could harm our financial results 
technologies have been developed  and are likely to continue to be developed  that can block the display of internet ads 
most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of their ads 
ad blocking technology may cause a decrease in the number of ads that we can display on our web properties  which could adversely affect our ad revenues and our financial results 

table of contents we face significant competition from question and answer sites  search engines and other free reference and industry specific web properties that could adversely impact our competitive position 
we face significant competition from a wide variety of web properties 
question and answer sites  such as yahoo answers  askville owned by amazon  live qna owned by microsoft  yedda owned by aol  answerbag 
com owned by demand media  inc and wikia  inc 
compete with wikianswers 
com 
destination portals and other free online information and or reference services  such as about 
com owned by the new york times  thefreedictionary 
com  dictionary 
com owned by iac interactivecorp and wikipedia 
org  compete with answers 
com 
other competitors of answers 
com include vertical industry specific web properties  such as bankrate 
com and webmd 
com 
since several companies operating traditional search engines  such as yahoo  microsoft  aol and ask 
com offer their own question and answer services  they too can be viewed as competitors of our answers driven products  particularly in light of the fact that some search engines have begun putting snippets of useful answers at the top of many of their pages  in response to queries made by users 
nevertheless  search engines remain the greatest source of traffic arriving at our web properties 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive management experience  an employee base with more extensive experience  better geographic coverage  larger consumer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resource than we do 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or attracting and retaining more users  then our competitive position and financial results could be adversely affected 
our failure to generate direct traffic to our web properties could adversely affect our business and financial results 
in addition to search engine traffic and traffic directed by the google definition link  our traffic also originates from internet users arriving at our web properties directly by typing our website address directly into their web browser  bookmarking our web properties  using answertips and visiting sites that direct users to our web properties 
given the wide availability of free search engines and reference content sites  we may not be able to retain current internet users or attract new internet users in this direct fashion 
if we are unable to retain our direct internet users or attract new direct internet users  our ability to generate revenues would be adversely impacted  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
traffic to our web properties and advertising demand fluctuates significantly on a seasonal basis  which impacts our operations from quarter to quarter 
many of our users are students that utilize our web properties as reference sources 
our traffic fluctuates with the academic school year  rising from january through may  falling to lower levels during the summer months  rising again in september through november  and falling again in december  coinciding with school breaks and the holiday season 
we expect traffic to our web properties to continue to fluctuate seasonally in the future 
this seasonal fluctuation in traffic results in a fluctuation in our quarterly revenues  since fewer users to our web properties translates into fewer users clicking on or viewing the advertisements on our web properties 
in addition  the demand for our advertising inventory fluctuates during the year based on the seasonal needs of our advertisers  rising to its highest levels during the fourth quarter and falling to its lowest levels in the first quarter 
accordingly  our revenue fluctuates based on the seasonality of our traffic and advertising demand 
the effect of this seasonality makes it difficult to estimate future revenues based on the results of any specific quarter  thus it is difficult to make operating plans relating to hiring and expenses 
additionally  as a result of the difficulty to estimate revenues  we may be unable to meet our revenue or profit and loss forecasts which could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
our operating results may fluctuate  which makes comparing our operating results on a period to period basis difficult and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  many outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
our quarterly  year to date and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates 
our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations 
any of these events could cause our stock price to fall 

table of contents we may not be successful in expanding our business through acquisitions  business combinations and other transactions  and  even if we are successful  our operations may be adversely affected as a result of these transactions 
we may pursue acquisitions  business combinations and joint ventures  which we refer to as extraordinary transactions 
our ability to implement this business strategy depends in large part on our ability to compete successfully with other entities for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners 
factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include our financial condition and resources relative to the financial condition and resources of competitors  our ability to issue common stock as potential consideration  the attractiveness of our common stock as potential consideration relative to the common stock of competitors  our ability to obtain financing  and our available cash  which depends upon our results of operations and our cash demands 
in addition  we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  if at all 
if we do complete acquisitions  we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals  or such acquisitions may be viewed negatively by customers  financial markets or investors 
in addition  any acquisitions that we make could lead to difficulties in integrating personnel and operations from the acquired businesses and in retaining and motivating key personnel from these businesses 
acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day responsibilities  increase our expenses or adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  we experienced such disruption  diversion and increased expenses during the course of our recent failed attempt to acquire lexico publishing group  llc 
future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we fail to maintain and enhance awareness of our web properties  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
we believe that maintaining and enhancing awareness of our web properties is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services and to the success of our business 
we also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in our market 
maintaining and enhancing our web properties may require us to spend increasing amounts of money on  and devote greater resources to  advertising  marketing and other brand building efforts  and these investments may not be successful 
further  even if these efforts are successful  they may not be cost effective 
if we are unable to continuously maintain and enhance our web properties  our traffic may decrease and we may fail to attract advertisers  which could in turn result in lost revenues and adversely affect our business and financial results 
our failure to license compelling content could result in lost revenue  as a result of a loss of users and advertisers 
we believe our future success depends in part upon our ability to deliver valuable content through our web properties 
while our user generated content continues to grow  we continue to also utilize traditional licensed content 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into new or renew current or future content agreements on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance our existing relationships with content providers or develop new relationships with alternative providers of content  our answers 
com service may become less attractive to internet users  resulting in decreased traffic to answers 
com  which could have an adverse effect on our ad revenues and a negative impact on our business 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain and expand our computer and communications systems  then interruptions and failures in our services could result  making our services less attractive to consumers and subjecting us to lost revenue from the loss of users and advertisers 
our ability to provide high quality user experience depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
over time  our web properties have experienced significant increases in traffic  and we continuously seek to further increase our user base 
accordingly  our internet servers must accommodate spikes in demand for our web pages in addition to potential significant growth in traffic 
delays and interruptions could frustrate users and reduce traffic on our web properties  adversely affecting our operations and growth prospects 
furthermore  our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  terrorist attacks  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems  which could adversely affect our operations 
we manage our answers 
com and wikianswers 
com web operations through our own colocation facility 
our colocation facility  located in new jersey  is provided by netaccess corporation 
we plan to add a second colocation site in the first half of in order to provide redundancy of web operations at the data center level 
until such time  our operations are centered in one single data center facility 
our single facility could suffer interruptions or failures in service 
our web operations would be adversely affected  making our services less attractive to consumers and subjecting us to lost revenue 
additionally  if we are unable to recruit and retain skilled employees to manage the web hosting operations  we may not be able to properly manage the necessary tasks to keep our systems running smoothly and grow the business 
if we were to lose the services of our key personnel  we may not be able to execute our business plan and our business could be adversely affected 
our ability to execute our business plan depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  marketing  sales and support personnel 
our employment agreements with our executive officers and key employees are terminable by either party upon days notice 
if we lose the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees joined a competitor or otherwise competed with us  our business could be adversely affected 
we cannot give assurance that we will be able to retain or replace our key personnel  and the services of key members of our research and development team  in particular  would be difficult to replace 
if we do not succeed in retaining or replacing our key personnel  we may be unable to execute our business plan and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
our business depends on increasing use of the internet by users searching for information  advertisers marketing products and services and web properties seeking to earn revenue to support their web content 
if the internet infrastructure does not grow and is not maintained to support these activities  our business will be harmed 
our success will depend on the continued growth and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security for providing reliable internet services 
internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it if the number of internet users continues to increase  or if existing or future internet users access the internet more often or increase their bandwidth requirements 
in addition  viruses  worms and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure  and could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as our ability to provide our solutions 
rules established by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  require us to expense equity compensation given to our employees and may impact our ability to effectively utilize equity compensation to attract and retain employees 
the fasb has adopted changes that require companies to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives effective january   which we have adopted 
these accounting changes may cause us to reduce the availability and amount of equity incentives provided to employees  which may make it more difficult for us to attract  retain and motivate key personnel 
additionally  it may be difficult for us to estimate the impact of such compensation charges on future operating results because they will be based upon the fair market value of our common stock and other assumptions at future dates 

table of contents we may be subject to liability for online services  which may not be limited by the safe harbors in the digital millennium copyright act  or dmca  the communications decency act  or cda  or the us children s online privacy protection act  or coppa 
if we do not meet the safe harbor requirements  or if it is otherwise determined that our web properties contain actionable content  we could be subject to claims  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we host certain services that enable individuals to generate content and engage in various online activities 
the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the united states and internationally 
claims have been threatened and may in the future be brought against us for defamation  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  unlawful activity  tort  including personal injury  fraud  or other theories based on the nature and content of information to which we provide links  or that may be posted online or generated by the users of our web properties 
our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources 
the dmca is intended  among other things  to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights or rights of others 
additionally  portions of the cda are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content 
a safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the dmca to certain online service providers that provide specific services  if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the dmca 
important questions regarding the safe harbor under the dmca and the cda have yet to be litigated  and we can not guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the dmca or of the cda 
if we are not covered by a safe harbor  for any reason  we could be exposed to claims  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
in addition  coppa was enacted in october coppa imposes civil and criminal penalties on persons distributing material harmful to minors over the internet to persons under the age of or collecting personal information from children under the age of we do not knowingly collect and disclose personal information from minors 
the manner in which coppa may be interpreted and enforced cannot yet be determined 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright  defamation  obscenity and personal privacy is uncertain 
we may be subject to claims that our content violates such laws  which could damage our business and cause our stock price to decline 
we also periodically enter into arrangements to offer third party products  services or content under the answers brand or through our web properties 
we may be subject to claims concerning these products  services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing  branding  broadcasting or providing access to them  even if we do not ourselves host  operate  provide  or provide access to them 
it is also possible that  if any information provided directly by us contains errors or is otherwise negligently provided to users  third parties could make claims against us 
while it is our belief that the terms of use governing the use of our web properties covers us against these types of claims  there are no assurances as to the final determination of these types of claims by any court of law 
furthermore  investigating and defending any of these types of claims is expensive  even to the extent that the claims are without merit or do not ultimately result in liability 
third parties may claim that we are infringing on their patents  trademarks or copyrights  which could result in substantial costs  diversion of significant managerial resources and significant harm to our reputation 
the industry in which we operate is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
we expect that internet technologies  software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party patent infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
from time to time  third parties may assert patent infringement claims against us in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
additionally  third parties may assert trademark infringement claims with respect to brand names we use from time to time and content we display on our web properties 
for example  a third party may make claims against us over the display of search results triggered by search terms that include trademark terms 
furthermore  we may be faced with copyright infringement claims 
we have received  and are likely to continue to receive  cease and desist letters demanding that we remove infringing content from our web properties based on a theory of copyright and trademark infringement 

table of contents a successful patent  trademark or copyright infringement claim against us by any third party  could subject us to substantial liability for damages and litigation costs  including attorneys fees  lawsuits that prevent us from further use of intellectual property and require us to permanently cease and desist from selling or marketing products that use the intellectual property  licensing intellectual property from a third party  which could include significant licensing and royalty fees not presently paid by us  adding materially to our costs of operations  developing new intellectual property  as a non infringing alternative  that could delay projects  add materially to our costs of operations and be unacceptable to our users  which in turn could adversely affect our traffic and revenues  and indemnifying third parties who have entered into agreements with us with respect to losses they incurred as a result of the infringement  which could include consequential and incidental damages that are material in amount 
regardless of the merit of third party infringement claims  these claims could result in substantial costs  diversion of significant resources and management attention  termination of customer contracts  loss of customers and significant harm to our reputation 
finally  many of our agreements with advertisers  distribution partners  and other third party partners require us to indemnify these partners for certain third party intellectual property infringement claims  which could increase our costs as a result of defending the claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling in any of the claims 
an adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products and services to others and may require that we procure substitute products or services  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our reputation  adversely affecting our competitive position and financial results 
our ability to compete depends in part upon the strength of our proprietary rights in our technologies  brands and content 
we rely on a combination of us and foreign patents  copyrights  trademark  trade secret laws and license agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective at stopping unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
in addition  effective trademark  domain name  patent  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or cost effective in every country in which our services are made available through the internet 
there may be instances where we are not able to fully protect or utilize our intellectual property in a manner that maximizes competitive advantage 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use  the value of our web properties may be reduced  which could negatively impact our business 
in addition  protecting our intellectual property and other proprietary rights is expensive and diverts critical managerial resources 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  or if we are otherwise unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
we have incurred significant and continuing net losses since our inception and may continue to incur losses 
we incurred net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve net income on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our revenues do not increase  or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced  we will continue to incur substantial losses  which would materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

table of contents new government regulation and legal uncertainties could require us to incur significant expenses 
the laws and regulations applicable to the internet  and to our products and services  are evolving and unclear and could damage our business 
in addition  we will be subject to any new laws and regulations directly applicable to our products and services 
it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  taxation  content regulation  quality of products and services  and intellectual property ownership and infringement 
this legislation could expose us to substantial liability as well as dampen the growth in use of the internet generally  decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  or require us to incur significant compliance expenses 
compliance with these laws and regulations may also cause us to change or limit our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
increased regulation or the imposition of access fees could substantially increase the costs of communicating on the internet  potentially decreasing the demand for our products 
a number of proposals have been made at the federal  state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
such proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of electronic commerce and could adversely affect us 
due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws 
we might unintentionally violate these laws 
such laws may be modified  or new laws may be enacted  in the future 
our business may be negatively affected by a variety of new or existing laws and regulations  which may expose us to substantial compliance costs and liabilities and may impede the growth in use of the internet generally 
risks related to our common stock our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq capital market 
although an active trading market has developed for our common stock  there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained 
failure to maintain an active trading market for our common stock may adversely affect our shareholders ability to sell our common stock in short time periods  or at all 
our common stock has experienced  and may experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
you may experience dilution in your percentage ownership interest as a result of any additional issuances of our common stock 
we have authorized million shares of our common stock  of which approximately million shares were issued and outstanding after giving effect to the assumed exercise of all outstanding warrants and options and assumed conversion of preferred stock as of december  our board of directors has the authority  without action or vote of our stockholders in many cases  to issue all or a part of any authorized but unissued shares 
such stock issuances may be made at a price that reflects a discount from the then current trading price of our common stock 
in addition  we may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exercisable for a significant amount of our common stock 
for example  on june   we sold series a convertible preferred stock and related warrants for million to redpoint ventures 
additionally  redpoint ventures is in possession of a warrant entitling the fund to invest a second tranche in the amount of million  in exchange for series b convertible preferred stock and related warrants 
see redpoint financing discussion in item below for a description of these transactions and the related securities 
these issuances may dilute your percentage ownership interest  which will have the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which our stockholders vote 
you may incur additional dilution if holders of stock options  whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted  exercise their options or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
in addition  these issuances  or the perception that such issuances may occur in the future  may have a depressant effect on our stock price and make it more difficult to raise capital in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

table of contents there may be substantial sales of our common stock  which could cause our stock price to fall 
all of our issued and outstanding shares are immediately available for sale in the public market without registration under rule sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the price of our securities to fall and could impair our ability to raise capital by selling additional securities 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we may incur penalties if the registration statement covering the common stock underlying the series a convertible preferred stock and the common stock purchase warrants does not remain effective 
under the terms of the registration rights agreement we entered into with the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock  we are obligated to register the common stock underlying the series a convertible preferred stock and the common stock purchase warrants 
the registration rights carry penalties in the event we do not meet these registration obligations 
the registration statement registering the common stock underlying the series a convertible preferred stock and the common stock purchase warrants was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on september  we agreed to use our commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure the continued effectiveness of the registration statement thereafter 
in the event sales of any or all of the securities covered by the registration statement cannot be made  whether because of our failure to keep the registration statement effective  or for various other reasons  then we must pay liquidated damages in cash to the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock in the amount of per month  on a daily pro rata basis  up to a maximum of  of the aggregate purchase price of  we have issued and could issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval with the effect of diluting then current stockholder interests 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval  to issue a series of preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights  which could dilute the interest of  or impair the voting power of  our stockholders 
the issuance of a series of preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
although we do not presently intend to issue any additional shares of preferred stock  we may do so in the future 
on june   we issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock to redpoint ventures 
in the event redpoint ventures exercises a warrant we granted it  we will issue shares of series b convertible preferred stock 
the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive liquidation payments in preference to the holders of our common stock 
pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation creating the series a convertible preferred stock  upon a liquidation of our company  the holders of shares of the series a convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation payment prior to the payment of any amount with respect to the shares of our common stock 
the amount of this preferential liquidation payment is equal to the greater of i per share of series a convertible preferred stock  plus the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends on those shares and any other fees or liquidated damages owing thereon or ii such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of series a convertible preferred stock been upon any such liquidation converted to common stock immediately prior to such liquidation 
dividends accrue on the shares of series a convertible preferred stock at a rate of per annum 
in addition  in the event the unit warrant is exercised we will issue up to  shares of series b convertible preferred stock 
if issued  the series b convertible preferred stock would have pari passu rights with the series a convertible preferred stock upon a liquidation of our company to receive a liquidation payment prior to the payment of any amount with respect to the shares of our common stock on substantially similar terms as the series a convertible preferred stock 

table of contents provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes  with one class being elected each year by our stockholders  which generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of directors and obtain control of our board 
in addition  stockholder meetings may be called only by our board of directors  the chairman of the board and the president  advance notice is required prior to stockholder proposals and stockholders may not act by written consent 
furthermore  we have authorized preferred stock that is undesignated  making it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of our company 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
specifically  section of the delaware general corporation law  to which our company is subject  may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by our stockholders 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because internet companies often experience significant stock price volatility 
if we faced such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
as of december   we determined that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and trading price of our stock 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
as of december   we were also required to obtain and disclose a report by our independent registered public accounting firm attesting to and reporting on these controls 
we dedicated significant amounts of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended december  based on their evaluation  our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that  as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal controls over i access to  and changes in  our information technology financial applications and underlying financial data  and ii the authority of our officers to obligate the company 
because of these material weaknesses  our management concluded that  as of december   we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
additionally  our auditors issued an adverse opinion with respect to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  although we remediated the material weaknesses by removing our controller as the information technology administrator for our enterprise resource management system in march and by adopting an approval policy that limits the authority of certain officers to obligate us in april  current and potential stockholders could negatively view the abovementioned material weaknesses and lose confidence in our financial reporting which could harm our business and trading price of our common stock 

table of contents material weaknesses in our internal controls may impede our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements  which could cause us to fail to file our periodic reports timely  result in inaccurate financial reporting or restatements of our financial statements  subject our stock to delisting and materially harm our business reputation and stock price 
as a public company  we are required to file annual and quarterly periodic reports containing our financial statements with the securities and exchange commission within prescribed time periods 
as part of the nasdaq capital market listing requirements  we are also required to provide our periodic reports  or make them available  to our shareholders within prescribed time periods 
if we are required to restate our financial statements in the future  any specific adjustment may be adverse and may cause our operating results and financial condition  as restated  on an overall basis to be materially and adversely impacted 
as a result  we or members of our management could be the subject of adverse publicity  investigations and sanctions by such regulatory authorities as the securities and exchange commission and subject to shareholder lawsuits 
any of the above consequences could cause our stock price to decline materially and could impose significant unanticipated costs on us 
if we are not able to issue our financial statements in a timely manner  we will not be able to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission and the listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market 
if these events occur  our common stock listing on the nasdaq capital market could be suspended or terminated and our stock price could materially suffer 
in addition  we or members of our management could be subject to investigation and sanction by the securities and exchange commission and other regulatory authorities and to shareholder lawsuits  which could impose significant additional costs on us  divert management attention and materially harm our operating results  financial condition  business reputation and stock price 
risks related to our location in israel conditions in israel may limit our ability to produce and sell our product  which would lead to a decrease in revenues 
because most of our operations are conducted in israel  our operations are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions affecting israel 
specifically  we could be adversely affected by any hostilities involving israel  a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the israeli army  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners  risks associated with the fact that a certain number of our key employees and one officer reside in what are commonly referred to as occupied territories  risks associated with outages and disruptions of communications networks due to any hostilities involving israel  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial conditions in israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
despite negotiations to effect peace between israel and its arab neighbors  the future of these peace efforts is uncertain 
since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  civil unrest and hostility  including armed clashes between the state of israel and the palestinians  and acts of terror have been committed inside israel and against israeli targets in the west bank and gaza strip 
in addition  the armed conflict with hezbollah on the northern border of israel during the summer of and the most recent armed conflict with hamas on the southern border of israel negatively affected business conditions in israel 
there is no indication as to how long the current hostilities will last or whether there will be any further escalation 
any further escalation in these hostilities or any future conflict  political instability or violence in the region may have a negative effect on our business  harm our results of operations and adversely affect our share price 
furthermore  there are a number of countries that restrict business with israel or with israeli companies  which may limit our ability to promote our products and services those countries 

table of contents we may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete under current israeli law that might result in added competition for our products 
we have non competition agreements with all of our employees  almost all of which are governed by israeli law 
these agreements prohibit our employees from competing with or working for our competitors  generally during and for up to months after termination of their employment 
however  israeli courts are reluctant to enforce non compete undertakings of former employees and tend  if at all  to enforce those provisions for relatively brief periods of time in restricted geographical areas and only when the employee has obtained unique value to the employer specific to that employer s business and not just regarding the professional development of the employee 
if we are not able to enforce non compete covenants  we may be faced with added competition 
the israeli government tax benefits program in which we currently participate and from which we receive benefits requires us to meet several conditions 
these programs or benefits may be terminated or reduced in the future  which may result in an increase in our tax liability 
our israeli subsidiary receives tax benefits authorized under israeli law for capital investments that are designated as approved enterprises 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  we must meet certain conditions 
if we fail to meet such conditions  these tax benefits could be cancelled  and we could be required to pay increased taxes or refund the amount of tax benefits we received  together with interest and penalties 
israeli governmental authorities have indicated that the government may in the future reduce or eliminate the benefits of such programs 
the termination or reduction of these programs and tax benefits could increase our israeli tax rates  and thereby reduce our net profits or increase our net losses 
us and israeli tax authorities may interpret tax issues in manners other than those which we have adopted  which may expose us to tax liabilities 
we operate in the us and in israel and our earnings are subject to taxation in both jurisdictions  at different rates 
relevant tax authorities may disagree with our interpretation and application in practice of tax laws and may dispute various assumptions we make during our tax planning process 
further  the tax authorities in the us and or israel may take exception with the transfer price of transactions between answers corporation and its wholly owned israeli subsidiary 
if there is a successful tax challenge of our tax position  our interpretation and or application of tax laws in practice  we may be forced to recognize additional tax liabilities  which may include interest and penalties 
this may harm our results of operations and adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be impacted by nis exchange rate fluctuations  which may negatively affect our earnings 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the nis may negatively affect our earnings 
our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
however  a significant portion of our expenses  associated with our israeli operations  including personnel and facilities related expenses  are incurred in nis 
consequently  a devaluation of the us dollar in comparison to the nis will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in israel 
in and  the average value of the dollar declined and  respectively  as compared to its value in the years immediately preceding such years 
we cannot predict any future trends in the rate of devaluation or appreciation of the nis against the us dollar or of the us dollar against the nis 
despite the fact that we often use various hedging tools  including forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our income  if the us dollar cost of our operations in israel increases  our dollar measured consolidated results of operations will be adversely affected

the series b convertible preferred stock is initially convertible into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the series b purchase warrants have an exercise price of per share

the series a convertible preferred stock has the rights and preferences set forth in our certificate of designations  number  voting powers  preferences and rights of series a convertible preferred stock  which  as of its date of filing on june   amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation

the accounting for this transaction is discussed in the notes to the accompanying financial statements 
revenue traffic our revenue is driven by the traffic generated by our web properties and our ability to effectively monetize that traffic 
our current sources of traffic include the following search engines users submit queries and search engines respond by generating a list of web pages that they deem likely to offer the most relevant content 
when our pages rank high in the algorithmic systems of search engines  our results are more likely to be accessed by users 
for the fourth quarter and full year of  according to our internal estimates  this source of traffic represented approximately and of our overall traffic  respectively 
direct users users visiting and returning to our home pages  and to a far lesser extent  arriving from web properties that send us traffic  or via click answers and answertips 
for the fourth quarter and full year of  according to our internal estimates  direct users represented approximately and of our overall traffic  respectively 
google s definition link we have an informal  non contractual relationship with google under which google links certain search results related to definitional queries to answers 
com 
for the fourth quarter and full year of  according to our internal estimates  this source of traffic represented approximately and of our overall traffic  respectively 
since most of our traffic originates from search engines  we expend considerable resources improving the volume of this traffic 
the industry commonly refers to such efforts as search engine optimization  or seo 
our web properties have at times experienced decreases in traffic  and consequently decreases in revenue  due to search engine actions  including actions by google 
in july  a search engine algorithm adjustment by google led to a drop in google directed traffic to answers 
com 
this adjustment reduced our overall traffic by approximately based on the average traffic directed to answers 
com from google for the week prior to the adjustment as compared to the week after 
as a result  our revenue also declined proportionately 
the change made by google did not affect the traffic directed to wikianswers 
com 
monetization advertising revenue 
we earn practically all of our revenue from advertising 
there are two primary categories of internet advertising pay per performance  also known as cost per click  or cpc  and pay per impression  also known as display ads or cost per  impressions  or cpm 
in the pay per performance model  we earn revenue based on the number of clicks associated with an ad  in the pay per impression model  we derive revenue from the display of ads 
the overwhelming majority of our advertising revenue is earned from cpc advertising 
we obtain cpc and cpm advertisements from third party ad networks 
these ad networks compensate us by paying us a portion of the revenue they earn from advertisers for our provision of promotional space on our web properties 

table of contents we gauge the effectiveness of our monetization efforts and trends by measuring our revenue per thousand page views  or rpm 
throughout this annual report  we refer to estimates of traffic  or page views 
in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prior to our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june   we tracked the traffic on our answers 
com and wikianswers 
com web properties using two separate systems answers 
com traffic was measured using our internally developed server side  log based system internal data warehouse 
this system was designed to identify traffic from search engine robots and other known web robots  commonly referred to as web spiders or web crawlers  as well as from suspected automated spidering scripts  and excludes such traffic from the traffic activity measurements 
wikianswers 
com traffic was tracked using hbx analytics  a tag based web analytics system offered by omniture  inc formerly offered by websidestory 
traffic measurements from this system are generated by our placement of tags on our wikianswers 
com pages 
the hbx analytics system then independently generates traffic metrics 
wikianswers 
com community related statistics  including total number of questions  answers and users  are generated from the wikianswers 
com web property 
beginning with the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june   all traffic measurements including measurements previously reported in past filings using our internal data warehouse for answers 
com are also presented based on the hbx analytics data 
we estimate that the historical page views for answers 
com pursuant to hbx analytics data  as set forth in our reports beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended june   are approximately lower than the traffic measurements reported in previous filings 
consequently  our answers 
com rpms  as reported in those reports  are higher than previous filings 
we also use google  inc s google analytics measurement services and google adsense data for various internal analyses 
our breakdown of our traffic sources  noted above  is based on such data 
google analytics measurements are generated by our placement of tags on our web properties pages  which google analytics uses to count and report audience metrics independently 
in this annual report  statistics gathered from hbx analytics and google analytics are also referred to as internal estimates 
third party services measuring traffic audiences may provide different estimates than the estimates reported by other similar services and our internal estimates 
these discrepancies may result from differences in methodologies applied or the sampling approaches used by each measuring service 
our primary third party ad network  google adsense  accounted for approximately of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared to approximately of our total revenue in the fourth quarter of google adsense accounted for approximately of our total revenue in as compared to approximately of our total revenue in we obtain cpc ads from google 
in addition to google  we utilize the services of other third party ad networks that provide us with cpm ads 
we expect that for at least the next year  cpc ads will continue to generate the overwhelming majority of our revenue  and we have no plans to reduce our reliance on cpc ads 
although there are many companies that provide third party ad networks  the loss of google as a third party ad network could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations  as we may not succeed in receiving terms and ad services as favorable as those provided under our google services agreement gsa 
the gsa was last renewed for an additional two years  through january  
table of contents direct ad sales 
in an effort to improve monetization  in the fourth quarter of  we began marketing directly to advertisers and generating additional advertising revenue through an in house team of direct ads salespeople 
however  at the end of the second quarter of we decided to suspend this business initiative  and by the end of the third quarter of we no longer employed a sales staff 
we initially saw promise in this area  with the belief that our web properties would see rpm increases as a result of direct ad sales 
in the fourth quarter of  the sales force generated thousand of direct ad revenue 
however  direct ad revenue in was disappointing  with q at thousand and q at thousand 
at the end of the second quarter we came to believe that the horizontal  educational  reference nature of answers 
com www 
answers 
commade direct ads less compelling for this web property  as compared to vertical sites that direct advertisers often prefer 
while we viewed wikianswers 
com as having the potential to successfully implement a direct ad sales strategy  we decided not to pursue that strategy and to instead focus on selling ads through advertising networks  primarily google adsense 
this decision has allowed us to focus on our core competency growing the wikianswers 
com community  growing traffic to our web properties and monetizing via google and other ad networks 
licensing revenue 
we also earn a very minor portion of our revenues from partners that pay us for providing them with our answer based services that they then use in their own products  via co branded web pages 
revenue from these arrangements are based on various formulas  including fees based on the number of user queries and fixed periodic fees 
costs and expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of fees to third parties to license content  data center costs  including depreciation of information technology assets  compensation  travel and overhead costs relating to personnel who are engaged in content editing  content integration and production operations  web search service fees  ad serving fees  amortization of the cost of acquired software used in our products  and contractual revenue sharing fees to various web property operators for visitors directed to our web properties  or traffic acquisition costs 
as revenues increase  we expect our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue to decrease  since many of its components  such as content licensing  are not directly tied to revenue 
notwithstanding  in the first half of  our cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  is expected to increase as we add our second colocation facility 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation  travel and overhead costs of personnel conducting research and development of our products and services  and consulting costs 
our research and development team works primarily on projects to improve and enhance product functionality  quality  performance  user interface  and monetization 
we generally expect that our research and development expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 
sales  marketing and community development expenses sales  marketing and community development expenses consist of compensation  travel and overhead costs of personnel in charge of sales and marketing  and developing and encouraging the wikianswers 
com community of users asking and answering questions and volunteer supervisors  product management  marketing and market information services  public relations and promotional costs 
as a result of our termination of direct ad sales in  we expect the primary future growth in this expense line item will be in the area of wikianswers 
com community development 
we generally expect that our sales  marketing and community development expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  travel and overhead costs for financial  legal  human resource  and other administrative personnel  insurance fees  professional services  including investor relations  legal  accounting  payroll and other consulting fees  amortization of domain names  and other general corporate expenses 
we generally expect that our general and administrative expenses will decline as a percentage of revenue as we grow our revenue 

table of contents overhead costs overhead costs consist primarily of rent  telecommunications  utilities and depreciation expenses 
stock based compensation new employees typically receive stock option awards within three months of their start date 
from time to time  we also grant additional stock option awards to existing employees and directors 
we account for stock based awards under sfas no 
revised  share based payments  or sfas r  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period awards are expected to vest 
costs resulting from stock based compensation are part of our compensation expense and are included in the operating expense categories in our statement of operations 
impact of currency fluctuations the dollar cost of our operations in israel is heavily influenced by changes in the value of the dollar in relation to the new israeli shekel nis  mostly due to the nis based salaries of our israel based employees 
in and  the average value of the dollar declined and  respectively  as compared to its value in the years immediately preceding such years 
in and  approximately million and million of our expenses  respectively  were nis based  thus the devaluation noted above  significantly influenced our operating expenses 
while hedging activities somewhat reduced the impact of the devaluation of the dollar during those periods  we absorbed most of the devaluation 
we expect our nis based expenses in  to at least remain at the levels  thus  if the dollar continues to fluctuate as compared to the nis  we will experience further fluctuation in the dollar amount of our expenses 
write off of the brainboost answer engine in december  we acquired brainboost technology  llc  developer of the brainboost answer engine  or the bae  an artificial intelligence technology enabling natural language question and answer search on the web 
as consideration for the acquisition  we paid million in cash and  shares of restricted stock  valued at approximately million at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with the initial allocation of the purchase price  we recorded an intangible asset  the bae  with an estimated useful life of six years  of approximately million 
since the acquisition  through the first quarter of  we spent time further developing the bae and integrating it into our answers 
com web property 
in november  we acquired a web property  then known as www 
faqfarm 
com  and subsequently rebranded as wikianswers 
com  a dynamic  user generated  questions and answers website 
although handled in different ways  bae and wikianswers 
com are effectively focused on similar areas  answering complex natural language questions 
since its acquisition  wikianswers 
com has grown significantly  in terms of both traffic and revenue 
conversely  during that period  answers 
com traffic and revenue has been in decline 
detailed information regarding these trends is provided in the revenue discussion in this annual report 
as a result of that trend  and the success of user generated questions and answers as compared to the technology driven answers presented by the bae  we made a strategic decision in the second quarter of to focus our efforts  in the realm of questions and answers  on user generated questions and answers  and effectively abandoned our use of the bae 
this strategic decision was reflected in a change that we made to answers 
com on may  prior to that date  users asking a question on answers 
com caused the site to access the bae in an attempt to locate an answer on the web 
the bae results were then presented on the answers 
com result page 
beginning may   users no longer received bae derived result pages  rather they were instead encouraged to post their question to wikianswers 
com  and in a less pronounced fashion  offered a link to another page for purposes of accessing bae should they wish to do so 
this user interface change virtually eliminated the use of the bae as demonstrated by the elimination of virtually all bae derived page views 
in november  we eliminated the link to the bae 
as a result of our decision to effectively abandon our use of the bae  the net book value of the bae  as of may   in the amount of  thousand  was written off in the three months ended june  
table of contents termination fees and write off of cost relating to the terminated lexico acquisition and abandoned follow on offering in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of  thousand consisting of  thousand of accounting  legal  banking  consulting and travel costs we incurred in and in the first quarter of  in connection with the abandoned acquisition of lexico and follow on offering of securities  and thousand relating to termination fees we paid as a result of the termination of the acquisition and a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor  for the optional purchase and sale of million of our senior secured convertible notes 
a summary of the events that led to the termination of the acquisition and financing follows on july   we entered into a purchase agreement that we subsequently amended on july  and november   and on january  we entered into an amended and restated purchase agreement  which we subsequently amended on february   to acquire all of the outstanding limited liability interests of lexico publishing group  llc for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash  subject to adjustments for closing net working capital 
consummation of the acquisition of lexico was subject to our ability to secure financing for the acquisition 
on july   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission which was declared effective on august  the registration statement covers up to an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt securities  units or any combination thereof 
on january   we filed a prospectus supplement for a proposed public offering which we later amended on february  on february  we canceled our proposed public offering due to unfavorable market conditions 
on march   the members of lexico terminated the purchase agreement  due to our inability to finance the acquisition 
additionally  in connection with the lexico transaction  on january   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor  or the senior notes investor  for the optional purchase and sale of million of our senior secured convertible notes 
our intent was to close the senior secured convertible notes financing in conjunction with our follow on offering  if we needed such funds to close the lexico acquisition 
since our purchase agreement with lexico was terminated  the securities purchase agreement also terminated 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net  is comprised of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and investment security balances  and amortization of deferred costs we incurred in connection with the issuance of the series b unit warrant 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  is comprised of foreign currency gains and losses 
loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants the series b unit warrant is revalued each reporting date 
any change to its fair value is recorded as a loss in the statement of operations 
income tax benefit expense  net our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate due to differences between income and expense recognition prescribed by income tax regulations and generally accepted accounting principles 
we utilize different methods and useful lives for depreciating and amortizing property  equipment and intangible assets and different methods and timing for certain expenses 
furthermore  permanent differences arise from certain income and expense items recorded for financial reporting purposes but not recognizable for income tax purposes 
in addition  our income tax expense has been adjusted for the effect of state and local taxes and foreign income from our wholly owned subsidiary 
at december   our deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance because realization depends on generating future taxable income  which  in our estimation  is not more likely than not to transpire 

table of contents our israeli subsidiary had net income in and  resulting from services we receive from the israeli subsidiary 
the israeli subsidiary charges us for research development and certain management services it provides us  plus a profit margin ranging from to 
however  the subsidiary is an approved enterprise under israeli law  which means that income arising from the subsidiary s approved research development activities  is subject to zero tax under the alternative benefit path for a period of ten years 
management services are taxable at the israeli corporate tax rate in effect at the time in 
currently  the subsidiary operates under two separate approved enterprise plans  ending december  and december   respectively 
in the event of distributions by the subsidiary to the parent  the subsidiary would have to pay a corporate tax on the amount distributed  and the recipient would have to pay a tax to be withheld at source on the amounts of such distribution received 
at present  we do not plan on having the subsidiary distribute a dividend to answers corporation

com traffic  reducing our overall traffic by approximately based on the average traffic directed to answers 
com from google for the week prior to the adjustment as compared to the week after 
as a result  our revenue also declined proportionately 
the answers 
com rpm in was  a decrease of  compared to the rpm of  in we have found that this metric often moves up or down moderately due to many factors including how we are evaluated by our advertising partners 
historically  we operated on the premise that adding rich unique content to answers 
com positively impacted the site s traffic growth  guided by the principle that rich unique content was not only appreciated by the human user  but was also highly valued by the search engines and their content indexing programs 
while answers 
com receives significant seo traffic to its rich content pages  the google algorithm change caused us to doubt whether licensing additional content would yield a positive return 
during the last few months we made certain changes to and ran certain tests on answers 
com that have led us to believe that adding content may  once again  be a viable way to grow traffic  thus  we are planning on licensing new content in order to grow answers 
com 
notwithstanding  given the significance of the opportunity we believe we have with wikianswers 
com  we do not expect to invest significant amounts of resources  above current levels  to implement a strategy of licensing new content 

table of contents approximately thousand and thousand of our advertising revenue in and  respectively  resulted from the efforts of our direct ad sales force 
in an effort to improve monetization  in the fourth quarter of  we began marketing directly to advertisers and generating additional advertising revenue 
however  at the end of the second quarter of we decided to abandon that effort  and by the end of the third quarter of  all of our direct sales staff left the company 
subscription revenue in of thousand resulted from the recognition of revenue from the sale of lifetime subscriptions to our gurunet service prior to december as of december   we had approximately thousand of deferred revenue relating to these subscriptions 
prior to  we did not recognize any revenue from the lifetime subscriptions to our gurunet service because the subscriptions had no defined term 
on february   in accordance with our rights under the agreements we entered into with such subscribers  we terminated the gurunet service and thereby extinguished our service obligations to our subscribers 
as a result  we recognized the entire thousand previously deferred  as revenue  in the first quarter of after the launch of answers

com since we purchased wikianswers 
com in november  the website has grown significantly  each quarter  both in terms of traffic and revenue 
conversely  in  and especially beginning the third quarter of  when we experienced a drop in our traffic due to a search engine algorithm adjustment by google  answers 
com s traffic and revenue have been in decline 
we expect the aforesaid trends of our individual web properties to continue in the current general economic downturn may result in fewer page views that result in commercial activities by our users  and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online advertising 
these potential developments could have a significant negative impact on the rpm of both our web properties 
in fact  our rpm has shown some moderate decline in the first quarter of  which we believe is due to both the seasonality of advertising rates as well as the general economic downturn 
we believe that  to date  we have been better insulated from the economic downturn than many other content websites due to the fact that the overwhelming majority of our ad revenue is earned from cpc ads  which appear to have been less negatively impacted by the economic downturn than cpm ads 
it is still uncertain whether our rpm will be further negatively impacted in 
table of contents additionally  our cpc revenue  which is earned through google  is governed by our gsa  which is scheduled to expire on january  renewal of the gsa in february on terms less favorable to us than the current terms  including the revenue share percentage  could result in reduced revenue from cpc ads 
we do not expect the current general economic downturn to affect our expected overall growth in traffic 
costs and expenses cost of revenue year ended december  change in thousands cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased thousand  or  to  in from  in the change in cost of revenue was due primarily to the following factors amortization expense from intangible technology assets we purchased in connection with the brainboost acquisition that took place in december and the wikianswers 
com acquisition that took place in november decreased thousand 
such decrease transpired because we wrote off the brainboost answer engine on may   thus we only recorded thousand of brainboost answer engine amortization in  as compared the full twelve months of amortization  of thousand  recorded in the amortization of the intangible assets related to wikianswers 
com decreased by thousand in  as compared to  since we use accelerated depreciation to amortize the database of questions and answers we acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of wikianswers 
additionally  there was a decrease in data center costs including depreciation of information technology assets of thousand  due to our moving to our own colocation facility rather than managed hosting 
in a colocation facility  many of the tasks that were handled by the managed hosting provider are now handled by our employees  thus the fees we pay are lower 
the aforesaid decreases were partially offset by increases in compensation costs of thousand as a result of staffing additions  salary increases and the weak us dollar as compared to the new israel shekel  increases in traffic acquisition costs of thousand  increases in ad serving fees of thousand  increases in travel of thousand  increases in content licensing costs of thousand  and higher overhead of thousand 
research and development expenses year ended december  change in thousands research and development research and development expenses increased thousand  or  to  thousand in from  thousand in the change in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase of thousand in compensation  as a result of salary increases  the weak us dollar as compared to the new israel shekel  and new hires  and higher overhead of thousand 

table of contents sales  marketing and community development expenses year ended december  change in thousands sales  marketing and community development sales  marketing and community development expenses decreased  thousand or  to  in  from  in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is due primarily to the following factors compensation related expenses  excluding stock based compensation  decreased thousand  mostly due to the termination of our chief revenue officer in the third quarter of  and the termination of our direct ad sales team in the second and third quarters of additionally  stock based compensation decreased thousand  mostly due to the termination of employment of our chief revenue officer in the third quarter of the termination of our direct ad sales team also resulted in a reduction of thousand in allocated overhead expenses  and marketing related expenses decreased thousand 
the aforesaid decreases were partially offset by a charge of thousand  in the second quarter of  to account for the estimated cost of terminating certain service contracts relating to our abandoned direct ad sales efforts

interest income expense  net year ended december  change in thousands interest income expense  net interest income expense  net decreased thousand to thousand expense  net  in from thousand  income  net  in the change in interest income expense  net resulted from certain transaction costs that we incurred in connection with the series b unit warrant  which have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over one year

loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants year ended december  change in thousands loss resulting from fair value adjustment of series b unit warrant the series b unit warrant is revalued each reporting date  and any change to its fair value is recorded in the statement of operations 
the primary reason for the increase in the value of this liability in was the increase in the market value of our common stock between the date we issued the series b unit warrant  june   and december   from to 
other income expenses  net year ended december  change in thousands other income expense  net other income expense  net  in was thousand  income  net  compared to thousand expense  net  in other income expense  net  results from foreign currency net gains and losses 

table of contents income tax benefit expense  net we had net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  for federal income tax purposes of approximately million at december   and approximately million at december  the federal net operating losses will expire if not utilized on various dates from through because we have experienced one or more ownership changes  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  an annual limitation is imposed on our ability to use at least million of these carryforwards 
we estimate that the annual limitation on the use of such million of our nols is approximately million per year 
any unused portion of the million annual limitation applicable to our restricted nols is available for use in future years until such nols are scheduled to expire 
the recent redpoint financing and other financing events that transpired since october may further impact our ability to use our nols  however  since we have not conducted a section study since october we cannot make that determination 
our israeli subsidiary has capital loss carryforwards of approximately thousand that can be applied to future capital gains for an unlimited period of time under current tax rules 
we file us federal  various state local and foreign income tax returns 
answers corporation is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to and state local income tax examinations for years prior to in september  the israeli income tax authorities completed its audit of our israeli subsidiary for the tax years through  resulting in no adjustments 
as a result of the findings of such audit  we reversed previously accrued tax provisions for uncertain positions  during the third quarter of liquidity and capital resources in and  our principal sources of liquidity were our cash inflows from revenues and cash and cash equivalents  and investment securities that were raised through various financing events that took place through june going forward  we expect that our principal source of liquidity will be cash inflows from operations 
we further expect that such cash inflows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures 
further  if redpoint decides to exercise their series b unit warrant  of up to million  between now and june   that could add to liquidity in year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities despite a net loss of  thousand in  net cash used in operations was only thousand 
the adjustments to reconcile the two amounts  including changes to the balances of our various operating assets and liabilities  are noted in detail on the accompanying statement of cash flows 
the largest reconciling item is the loss resulting from the fair value adjustment of the series b unit warrant of  thousand 
the primary factor that caused the fair value of the series b unit warrant  a liability on our balance sheet  to rise  is the rise in our stock price between june   the closing date of the redpoint transaction  and december  should redpoint exercise such warrant  which terminates after june   such investment will add an additional million of liquidity 
other very large reconciling items were the write off of the brainboost answers engine of  thousand   thousand of operating expenses that were the result of non cash stock based compensation to employees and directors  and depreciation and amortization of  thousand 
despite a net loss of  thousand in  net cash used by operations was thousand 
the adjustments to reconcile the two amounts  including changes to the balances of our various operating assets and liabilities  are noted in detail on the accompanying statement of cash flows 
the largest reconciling items resulted from the fact that we incurred  thousand of non cash  stock based compensation to employees and directors  depreciation and amortization of  thousand  while recognizing thousand of previously deferred revenue from lifetime subscriptions we sold for our gurunet service in 
table of contents investing activities net cash provided by investing activities of thousand  in  is attributable to the proceeds from the sale of investment securities of thousand  less cash used to increase long term deposits of thousand and cash used for capital expenditures of thousand 
net cash provided by investing activities in is attributable mostly to the proceeds from the sale of investment securities less cash used from purchases of investment securities  and cash used for capital expenditures  long term deposits and deferred costs relating to the proposed lexico acquisition  as delineated in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
financing activities net cash flow from financing activities in of  thousand was mostly from the redpoint financing  which raised  thousand after expenses 
the other factors impacting net cash flow from financing activities are delineated in the accompanying statement of cash flows 
cash flow used in financing activities in stems from deferred costs relating to the proposed lexico financing  less net proceeds from the exercise of stock options  as delineated our consolidated statement of cash flows 
future operations as a result of the redpoint financing in june  we raised net proceeds of approximately million  significantly improving our cash position 
as part of the redpoint financing  redpoint received the series b unit warrant  a warrant to purchase units  exercisable at any time until june   for up to million of series b convertible preferred stock  shares and series b purchase warrants 
the series a preferred stock contains a redemption provision which allows the holder of a majority of the series a preferred stock to request redemption  at any time on or after june   of all or any part of the outstanding series a preferred stock 
if issued  the series b preferred stock would have a similar redemption provision 
the funding we received from redpoint is important to us because of prior events that decreased our cash position considerably 
in connection with the abandoned proposed public offering and the terminated lexico purchase agreement  we made cash payments of  thousand in the first quarter of  in addition to the thousand we expended in  for termination fees and costs 
these payments had a material impact on the balance of our cash and cash equivalents  which were  thousand as of march  based on our current cash and cash equivalents levels and expected cash flow from operations  we believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet our working capital and operating requirements for the next twelve months  irrespective of whether we receive additional funding pursuant to the series b unit warrant 
further  in estimating our expected cash flow during the next twelve months we have considered the current general economic downturn and its impact on our future revenue  as discussed in the earlier revenue discussion 
we assess acquisition opportunities as they arise 
financing in excess of our current cash and cash equivalents may be required if we decide to make additional acquisitions 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such opportunities may arise  or that any such acquisitions may be consummated 
additional financing may not be available on satisfactory terms when required 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
off balance sheet arrangements except for the series a purchase warrant described in note to the financial statements in item below  we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities in which we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities or any other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support 
critical accounting estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we account for our purchases of acquired companies for those acquired before december  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas  and for goodwill and other identifiable definite and indefinite lived acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas additionally  we review our long lived assets for recoverability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas the identification and valuation of intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition are based on various valuation methodologies including reviews of projected future cash flows 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
further  changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets  which could result in an impairment of the goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we evaluate our long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  with the annual impairment testing date set at september  and in accordance with sfas whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
while we use available information to prepare our estimates and to perform impairment evaluations  the completion of annual impairment tests requires significant management judgments and estimates 
as of december   we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  therefore  there was no need to evaluate the recoverability or compute impairment of our long lived assets 
in response to the search engine algorithm adjustment by google in july  we examined what impact this event might have on the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with the guidance contained in sfas and sfas as a result of our analysis  we concluded that the carrying value of our assets had not been impaired 
however  while we use available information to prepare our estimates and to perform impairment evaluations  our recoverability calculations and impairment tests require significant management judgment and estimates 
these estimates included our projections of undiscounted cash flows and assumptions used in calculating projected rpm  page views  and expenses 
in preparing such estimates we considered many factors including historical and seasonal trends  industry and macro economic trends and specific company initiatives and plans 
in addition  a certain degree of judgment was exercised in determining asset groups in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
had our estimates and assumptions differed  the accounting treatment might have resulted differently 
future actual results could differ significantly from the anticipated results as reflected in our analysis 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based awards under sfas no 
r which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest  using the modified prospective method 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider various factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
we determine the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the black scholes valuation model  which considers the exercise price relative to the market value of the underlying stock  the expected stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate and the dividend yield  and the estimated period of time option grants will be outstanding before they are ultimately exercised 
subsequent to our ipo  through  we did not have sufficient history to predict our volatility and therefore our assumptions about stock price volatility were based on the volatility rates of comparable publicly held companies 
these rates may or may not reflect our actual stock price volatility 
during  as we accumulated our own volatility history over longer periods of time  our assumptions about our stock price volatility were based on a rate that was derived by taking into consideration the volatility rates of the aforesaid comparable publicly held companies as well as our own historical volatility rates 
beginning  we are estimating our expected stock volatility based solely on our own historical stock volatility rates 
had we made different assumptions about our stock price volatility or the estimated time option and warrant grants will be outstanding before they are ultimately exercised  the related stock based compensation expense and our net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different  in and 
table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have fully offset our us net deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate us taxable income prior to the expiration of such deferred tax assets were the primary factors considered by management in establishing the valuation allowance 
in july  fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin prescribes how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
additionally  for tax positions to qualify for deferred tax benefit recognition under fin  the position must have at least a more likely than not chance of being sustained upon challenge by the respective taxing authorities 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january  and it has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
redpoint financing in accounting for the redpoint financing  the proceeds were first allocated to the series b unit warrant  which was classified as a current liability  based on its fair value  and the residual amount was allocated among the series a convertible preferred stock and the series a warrants based on their relative fair values  all in accordance with the guidance in sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
further  the series b unit warrant is revalued at each reporting date 
we used various valuation models and techniques to determine the individual values of the three components  including monte carlo and black scholes 
inputs used in the models include our stock price and risk free interest rate 
additionally  significant assumptions used in applying these techniques include redemption behavior estimates including likelihood of forced conversion  and timing of liquidation event if such event transpires and expected volatility of our stock price 
while we believe we have applied appropriate judgment in the aforesaid assumptions  variations in judgment could have a material effect upon the valuation results  and thus  on our financial statements 
the series a convertible preferred stock issued as part of the redpoint financing contains an embedded conversion option which could possibly require separate accounting under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
according to paragraph a of sfas  in order to determine whether separate accounting is required  one has to evaluate whether the economic characteristics and risks of the conversion option are closely related to the host contract  and the nature of the host contract 
we exercised judgment and evaluated this matter in accordance with eitf topic d  determining the nature of a host contract related to a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share under fasb statement no 
topic d 
topic d conveys the sec staff s views on determining whether the characteristics of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity 
in evaluating an embedded derivative feature for separation under sfas  the consideration of the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract should not ignore the stated or implied substantive terms and features of the hybrid financial instrument 
we considered various factors including  redemption provisions  stated rate  voting rights  whether returns are discretionary or mandatory  collateral requirements  participation in residual earnings and liquidation preferences  in making our determination that the host contract was more akin to equity 
the most important factor that led us to the conclusion that the host contract was more akin to equity was the fact that the redemption feature was not mandatory or likely to occur 
had we determined that the host contract was more akin to debt and not equity it would have impacted the accounting for the host contract and the embedded conversion option and could have had a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas gives financial statement users better information about the reporting entity s hedges by providing for qualitative disclosures about the objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative data about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative contracts  and details of credit risk related contingent features in their hedged positions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those years 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under statement fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of adopting fsp fas on our financial position and results of operations

fsp apb requires issuers of convertible debt that may be settled wholly or partly in cash when converted to account for the debt and equity components separately 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
the adoption of fsp apb is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus of eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
eitf responded to practice questions about whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to the reporting company s own stock by establishing a framework for the determinations and by nullifying some previous requirements 
the adoption of eitf s requirements will affect issuers accounting for warrants and many convertible instruments with provisions that protect holders from declines in the stock price down round provisions 
warrants with such provisions will no longer be recorded in equity  and many of the convertible instruments with such provisions will have to be bifurcated  with the conversion option separately accounted for as a derivative under sfas eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
it will initially be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings at the date of adoption for the effect on outstanding instruments 
the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations and is discussed in note to the accompanying financial statements

table of contents we define adjusted ebitda as net earnings before interest  loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  foreign currency exchange rate differences and certain non recurring revenues and expenses 
we use adjusted ebitda as an additional measure of our overall performance for purposes of business decision making  developing budgets and managing expenditures 
it is useful because it removes the impact of our capital structure interest expense and loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants  asset base amortization and depreciation  stock based compensation expenses  taxes  foreign currency exchange rate differences and certain non recurring revenues and expenses from our results of operations 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors in their analysis of our results of operations for reasons similar to the reasons why we find it useful and because these measures enhance their overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects of our ongoing business operations 
by reporting adjusted ebitda  we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between current  past and future periods  and peer companies in our industry 
more specifically  we believe that removing these impacts is important for several reasons amortization of intangible assets 
adjusted ebitda disregards amortization of intangible assets and other specified costs resulting from acquisitions 
specifically  we exclude a amortization  and the write off  of acquired technology from our acquisition of brainboost technology  llc  or brainboost  developer of the brainboost answer engine in december  and b amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of wikianswers 
com and other related assets in november these acquisitions resulted in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred 
we believe that excluding these expenses is helpful to investors  due to the fact that they derive from prior acquisition decisions and are not necessarily indicative of future operating expenses 
in addition  we believe that the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our core business operations 
while we exclude the aforesaid expenses from adjusted ebitda we do not exclude revenues derived as a result of such acquisitions 
the revenue attributable to wikianswers 
com in and was  thousand  and  thousand  respectively 
the revenue attributable to our acquisition of the brainboost technology was not quantifiable due to the nature of its integration 
stock based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda disregards expenses associated with stock based compensation  a non cash expense arising from the grant of stock based awards to employees and directors 
we believe that  because of the variety of equity awards used by companies  the varying methodologies for determining stock based compensation expense  and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations  excluding stock based compensation from adjusted ebitda enhances the ability of management and investors to compare financial results over multiple periods 
depreciation  interest  loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants  taxes and foreign currency gains losses 
we believe that  excluding these items from the adjusted ebitda measure provides investors with additional information to measure our performance  by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  asset composition  and tax positions 
terminated lexico acquisition and follow on offering 
adjusted ebitda disregards  thousand in costs associated with our terminated acquisition of lexico and the cancellation of our follow on offering 
we believe that  excluding these costs provides investors with additional information to measure our core business performance  by excluding events that are of a non recurring nature 
prior to december  we sold lifetime subscriptions to our gurunet service  generally for per subscription 
in december  we decided to alter our pricing model and moved to an annual subscription model  for which we generally charged our subscribers per year 
we have not sold subscriptions since our launch of answers 
com in january in february  we terminated the gurunet service and recognized thousand of deferred revenue as revenue during the quarter ended march  we believe that the recognition of the thousand of revenue is a one time  non cash event and is not reflective of our core business and core operating results  and we have therefore excluded this amount from adjusted ebitda 

table of contents adjusted ebitda is not a measure of liquidity or financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
investors are cautioned of inherent limitations associated with the use of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are non gaap financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles  many of the adjustments to adjusted ebitda reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than us  thus limiting its usefulness as a comparative tool  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the periodic costs of certain tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest income from our investments in cash and investment securities  adjusted ebitda does not reflect interest expense and other cost relating to financing our business  including loss resulting from fair value adjustment of warrant to purchase units of series b preferred stock and warrants  adjusted ebitda does not reflect foreign currency gains and losses  adjusted ebitda excludes taxes  which is an integral cost of doing business  and because adjusted ebitda does not include stock based compensation  it does not reflect the cost of granting employees equity awards  a key factor in management s ability to hire and retain employees 
we compensate for these limitations by providing specific information in the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the gaap net loss  as follows quarter ended mar
