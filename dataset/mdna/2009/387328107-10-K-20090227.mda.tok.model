item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
design build is increasingly being used as a method of project delivery 
unlike traditional projects where owners first hire a design firm or design a project themselves and then put the project out to bid for construction  design build projects provide the owner with a single point of responsibility and a single contact for both final design and construction 
revenue from design build projects represented and of granite east revenue in and  respectively and and of granite west revenue in and  respectively 
although these projects carry additional risk as compared to traditional bid build projects  the profit potential can also be higher 
we frequently bid design build projects as a part of a joint venture team 
granite land company glc purchases  develops  operates  sells and otherwise invests in real estate developments as well as provides real estate services for other granite operations 
glc s current portfolio consists of residential  retail and office site development projects for sale to home and commercial property developers or held for rental income in washington  california  texas and oregon 
in  revenue from glc was million of our total revenue  compared with million of our total revenue in additional information about our business segments is contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents business strategy our fundamental objective is to increase long term shareholder value by focusing on consistent profitability from controlled revenue growth 
shareholder value is measured by the appreciation of the value of our common stock over a period of years as well as a return from dividends 
further  it is a specific measure of our financial success to achieve a return on net assets greater than the cost of capital  creating granite value added 
we believe that the following are key factors in our ability to achieve these objectives controlled expansion we intend to continue our expansion by selectively adding branches or branch satellite locations in the western united states  exploring opportunities to establish branch like businesses in other areas of the country through acquisitions  and selectively pursuing major infrastructure projects where we have an established presence 
decentralized profit centers we approach each selected market with a local focus through our decentralized structure 
each of our granite west branch offices and granite east regional offices are individual profit centers 
this structure encourages entrepreneurial activity while allowing the offices to benefit from certain centralized administrative functions 
diversification to mitigate the risks inherent in construction and general economic factors  we pursue projects i in both the public and private sectors  ii for a wide range of customers within each sector from the federal government to small municipalities and from large corporations to individual homeowners  iii in diverse geographic markets  iv that are design build  lump sum and fixed unit price and v of various sizes  durations and complexity 
employee development we believe that our employees are key to the successful implementation of our business strategies 
significant resources are employed to attract  develop and retain extraordinary talent and fully promote each employee s capabilities 
infrastructure construction focus we concentrate our core competencies on this segment of the construction industry  which includes the building of roads  highways  bridges  dams  tunnels  mass transit facilities  railroad infrastructure and underground utilities as well as site preparation 
this focus allows us to most effectively utilize our specialized strengths  which include grading  paving and concrete structures 
ownership of aggregate materials and construction equipment we own and lease aggregate reserves and own processing plants that are vertically integrated into our construction operations and we own a large fleet of carefully maintained heavy construction equipment 
by ensuring availability of these resources and providing quality products  we believe we have bidding advantages in many of our markets  as well as a source of revenue and income from the sale of construction materials to unaffiliated parties 
profit based incentives we incentivize our profit center managers with a substantial variable cash and restricted stock incentive element based primarily on the annual profit performance of their respective profit centers 
selective bidding we focus our resources on bidding jobs that meet our selective bidding criteria  which include analyzing the risk of a potential job in relation to i available personnel to estimate and prepare the proposal  ii personnel to effectively manage and build the project  iii competitive environment  iv experience with the type of work  v experience with the owner  vi local resources and partnerships  vii equipment resources  viii size and complexity of the job and ix profitability 
operating principles that support these objectives are as follows accident prevention we believe that preventing accidents is both a moral obligation and good business 
by identifying and concentrating resources to address jobsite hazards  we continually strive to reduce our incident rates and the costs associated with accidents 
environmental responsibility we believe it benefits everyone to maintain environmentally responsible operations 
we are committed to protect the environment  maintain good community relations and ensure compliance with government agency requirements 
we continually monitor our performance in this area 
quality and high ethical standards we emphasize the importance of performing high quality work and maintaining high ethical standards through an established code of conduct and an effective corporate compliance program 

table of contents customers we have customers in both the public and private sectors 
the largest volume customer of granite west is the california department of transportation caltrans 
in  contracts with caltrans represented of our total revenue of granite west revenue  and total public sector revenue generated in california represented of our total revenue 
in  contracts with caltrans represented of our total revenue  and total public sector revenue generated in california represented of our total revenue 
other granite west customers include certain federal agencies  departments of transportation of other states  county and city public works departments  school districts and developers and owners of industrial  commercial and residential sites 
granite east s customers are predominantly in the public sector and currently include numerous state departments of transportation  local transit authorities  and federal agencies 
contract backlog our contract backlog is comprised of the remaining unearned revenue of awarded contracts that have not been completed  including of our consolidated joint ventures and our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts 
our contract backlog was approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
approximately billion of the december  contract backlog is expected to be completed during we include a construction project in our contract backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and funding is in place  with the exception of certain federal government contracts for which funding is appropriated on a periodic basis 
substantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog may be canceled or modified at the election of the customer  however  we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past see contract provisions and subcontracting 
most granite west projects are added and completed within each year and therefore not reflected in our year end contract backlog 
contract backlog by segment is presented in contract backlog under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
equipment and plants we own many pieces of equipment  including loaders  bulldozers  excavators  rollers  motor graders  pavers  scrapers  cranes  trucks  backhoes and barges as well as construction materials processing plants 
in and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  for construction equipment  plants and vehicles 
at december  and  we owned the following construction equipment  plants and vehicles december  heavy construction equipment units trucks  truck tractors and trailers and vehicles units aggregate crushing plants asphalt concrete plants portland cement concrete batch plants asphalt rubber plants lime slurry plants we believe that ownership of equipment is generally preferable to leasing because ownership ensures the equipment is available as needed and normally results in lower equipment costs 
we keep our equipment as fully utilized as possible by pooling certain equipment for use by both granite west and granite east 
we regularly lease or rent equipment on a short term basis to supplement existing equipment and respond to construction activity peaks 
employees on december   we employed approximately  salaried employees  who work in management  estimating and clerical capacities  plus approximately  hourly employees 
the total number of hourly personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress and is seasonal 
during  the number of hourly employees ranged from approximately  to  and averaged approximately  two of our wholly owned subsidiaries granite construction company and granite construction northeast  inc are parties to craft collective bargaining agreements in many areas in which they work 
we believe our employees are our most valuable resource and that our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company 
among salaried and non union hourly employees  this dedication is reinforced by equity ownership through our employee stock ownership plan  our profit sharing and k plan and performance based incentive compensation arrangements at december  our managerial and supervisory personnel have an average of approximately years of service with us 

table of contents competition factors influencing our competitiveness include price  reputation for quality  the availability of aggregate materials  machinery and equipment  financial strength  knowledge of local markets and conditions  and project management and estimating abilities 
although some of our competitors are larger than us and may possess greater resources  we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors 
historically  the construction business has not required large amounts of capital  particularly for the smaller size construction work pursued by granite west  which can result in relative ease of market entry for companies possessing acceptable qualifications 
granite west competitors range from small local construction companies to large regional  national and global construction companies 
while the market areas of these competitors overlap with several of the markets served by our branches  few compete in all of our market areas 
many of our granite west competitors have the ability to perform work in either the private or public sectors 
when opportunities for work in one sector are reduced  competitors tend to look for opportunities in the other sector 
this migration has the potential to reduce revenue growth and or increase pressure on gross profit margins 
in addition  we own and or have long term leases on aggregate resources that provide an extra measure of competitive advantage in certain markets 
granite east normally competes with large regional  national and global construction companies 
although the construction business is highly competitive  we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate 
contract provisions and subcontracting our contracts with our customers are primarily either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yard of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  errors in our estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk of performing all the work for the specified amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our contract backlog decreased to approximately at december  compared with approximately at december  our contracts are generally obtained through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local government agencies and private parties 
less frequently  contracts may be obtained through direct negotiations with private owners 
our contract risk mitigation process includes identifying risks and opportunities during the bidding process  review of bids fitting certain criteria by various levels of management and  in some cases  by the executive committee of our board of directors 
there are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance and results as compared to a project s original bid 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment or materials 
all of these factors can impose inefficiencies on contract performance  which can drive up costs and lower profits 
conversely  if any of these or other factors are more positive than the assumptions in our bid  project profitability can improve 
however  the ability to realize improvements on project profitability is more limited than the risk of lower profitability 
design build projects typically incur additional costs such as right of way and permit acquisition costs and carry additional risks such as design error risk and the risk associated with estimating quantities and prices before the project design is completed 
design errors may result in higher than anticipated construction costs and additional liability to the contract owner 
although we manage this additional risk by adding contingencies to our bid amounts  obtaining errors and omissions insurance and obtaining indemnifications from our design consultants where possible  there is no guarantee that these risk management strategies will always be successful 
all of our state and federal government contracts and most of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the contract owner  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we have not been materially adversely affected by these provisions in the past 
many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met and these amounts can be significant 
we act as prime contractor on most of the construction projects we undertake 
we accomplish the majority of our projects with our own resources and subcontract specialized activities such as electrical and mechanical work 
as prime contractor  we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract  including subcontract work 
thus  we may be subject to increased costs associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated 
based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities  among other criteria  we determine whether to require that the subcontractor furnish a bond or other type of security that guarantees their performance 
disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our best efforts to subcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged subcontractors 
as with all of our subcontractors  some may not be able to obtain surety bonds or other types of performance security 

table of contents insurance and bonding we maintain general and excess liability  construction equipment and workers compensation insurance  all in amounts consistent with industry practices 
in connection with our business  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our contract backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
the capacity of the surety market is subject to market based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation 
when the surety market capacity shrinks it results in higher premiums and increased difficulty obtaining bonding  in particular for larger  more complex projects throughout the market 
in order to help mitigate this risk  we employ a co surety structure involving three sureties 
although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity has significantly impacted our ability to grow our business  there is no assurance that it will not significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts in the future see item a 
risk factors 
environmental regulations our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non compliance and others  such as the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  impose strict  retroactive  joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances 
we continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps at our locations to ensure compliance with environmental laws 
while compliance with applicable regulatory requirements has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
in addition  our aggregate materials operations require operating permits granted by governmental agencies 
we believe that tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and other factors will make it increasingly difficult to obtain new permits and renewal of existing permits may be subject to more restrictive conditions than currently exist 
in july  the california air resources board carb approved a regulation that will require california equipment owners operators to reduce diesel particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions from in use off road diesel equipment to meet progressively more restrictive emission targets proposed for each year from to in december  carb approved a similar regulation for in use on road diesel equipment that includes more restrictive emission targets from to the emission targets will require california off road and on road diesel equipment owners to retrofit equipment with diesel emission control devices or replace equipment with new engine technology as it becomes available 
between now and the year  granite will be required to implement an equipment management strategy that includes accelerated turnover of off road and on road diesel equipment and retrofitting equipment with carb approved emission control devices 
this will increase equipment related expenses 
as is the case with other companies in our industry  some of our aggregate products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica  a common mineral 
also  some of our construction and material processing operations release  as dust  crystalline silica that is in the materials being handled 
excessive  prolonged inhalation of very small sized particles of crystalline silica has allegedly been associated with respiratory disease including silicosis 
the mine safety and health administration and the occupational safety and health administration have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust 
we monitor to verify that our dust control procedures are keeping occupational exposures at or below the requisite thresholds and to verify that respiratory protective equipment is made available when required 
we also communicate  through safety information sheets and other means  what we believe to be appropriate warnings and cautions to employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive  prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular

table of contents item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in the report or otherwise adversely affect our business 
uncertainty regarding the impact of the current economic downturn and governmental initiatives to stimulate the economy 
a protracted financial crisis may affect government funding that we rely upon for our core infrastructure focus  including state dot s such as caltrans 
a substantial majority of our revenues are derived from contracts that are funded by federal  state  and local government agencies 
our ability to obtain future public sector work at reasonable margins is highly dependent on the amount of work that is available to bid  which is largely a function of the level of government funding available 
it may also affect our customer base  subcontractors and suppliers and could materially affect our contract backlog  operating results  cash flows and our ability to implement our strategic plan 
many of our risk factors identified below could be negatively impacted should the current financial crisis be prolonged 
our commercial and residential site development work may be affected by economic downturns 
the availability of private sector work can be adversely affected by economic downturns in the residential housing market  demand for commercial property or the availability of credit 
to the extent these events occur  our operating results will be adversely affected 
granite land company is greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry 
our real estate development activities are subject to numerous factors beyond our control including local real estate market conditions  substantial existing and potential competition  general national  regional and local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability and changes in demographic conditions 
if our outlook for a project s forecasted profitability deteriorates  we may find it necessary to curtail our development activities and evaluate our real estate assets for possible impairment 
our evaluation includes a variety of estimates and assumptions and future changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact future impairment analyses 
if our real estate assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment would result in a charge to income from operations in the year of the impairment 
our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a competitive environment 
the single largest factor in our ability to profitably execute our work is our ability to attract  develop and retain qualified personnel particularly as we grow 
our success in attracting qualified people is dependent on the resources available in individual geographic areas and changes in the labor supply as a result of general economic conditions as well as our ability to provide a competitive compensation package and work environment 
our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost 
as more fully described under contract provisions and subcontracting above  the profitability of our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid 
our design build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions 
design build is increasingly being used as a method of project delivery  providing the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction 
we generally pass design responsibility on to the architectural and engineering firms that we engage to perform these services on our behalf 
however  in the event of a design error or omission causing damages  there is risk that the firm or the errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the liability 
in this case we may be responsible  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
accounting for our revenues and costs involves significant estimates 
as further described in critical accounting estimates under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  accounting for our contract related revenues and costs  as well as other cost items  requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe we have sufficient experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate assumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates  these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future  and these changes could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit and have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
many of our contracts have penalties for late completion 
in some instances  including many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for cost impacts resulting from any delay  generally in the form of contractually agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 

table of contents weather can significantly impact our quarterly revenues and profitability 
our ability to perform work is significantly impacted by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature 
changes in weather conditions can create significant variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability  particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
additionally  delays and other weather impacts may increase a project s cost and decrease its profitability 
we work in a highly competitive marketplace 
as more fully described under competition above  we have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work 
during economic down cycles or times of lower government funding for public works projects  competition for the fewer available projects intensifies and this increased competition may result in a decrease in our ability to be competitive at acceptable margins 
an inability to secure and permit aggregate reserves could negatively impact our future operations and results 
tighter regulations for the protection of the environment and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure and permit aggregate reserves 
although we have thus far been able to secure and permit reserves to support our business  it is likely to become increasingly difficult and costly to do so and there is no assurance that we will be able to secure and permit reserves in the future 
we are subject to environmental and other regulation 
as more fully described under government and environmental regulations above  we are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  workplace safety and a variety of socioeconomic requirements  the noncompliance with which can result in substantial penalties  termination or suspension of government contracts as well as civil and criminal liability 
while compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future 
strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of our craft workforce 
although our results and operations have not been significantly impacted by strikes or work stoppages in the past  such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations if they occur in the future 
unavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative impact on our operations and results 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts 
although we have been able to obtain insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future 
an inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results 
as more fully described in insurance and bonding above  we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts 
our inability to obtain surety bonds in the future would significantly impact our ability to obtain new contracts  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our joint venture contracts with project owners subject us to joint and several liability 
if a joint venture partner fails to perform we could be liable for completion of the entire contract and  if the contract were unprofitable  this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations 
diesel fuel  liquid asphalt and other petroleum based products are used to fuel and lubricate our equipment  fire our asphalt concrete processing plants and constitute a significant part of the asphalt paving materials that are used in many of our construction projects and sold to outside parties 
although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts  many contracts provide no such protection 
we also use cement  steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations 
we have not been significantly adversely affected by price fluctuations in the past  however  there is no guarantee that we will not be in the future 

table of contents as a part of our growth strategy we expect to make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve many risks 
these risks include difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from our ongoing operations  potential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to increase our liabilities  record goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to subsequent impairment testing and potential impairment charges and incur amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results significantly 
failure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results 
as further described under contract provisions and subcontracting above  we subcontract a portion of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors and we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work 
although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees  we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher risk subcontractors  and there is no guarantee that we will not incur a material loss due to subcontractor performance issues 
we may be unable to identify qualified disadvantaged business enterprise dbe contractors to perform as subcontractors 
certain of our government agency projects contain minimum dbe participation clauses 
if we subsequently fail to complete these projects with the minimum dbe participation we may be held responsible for damages due to breach of contract including restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects and monetary damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
government funded contracts generally have strict regulatory requirements 
approximately of our consolidated revenue in was derived from contracts funded by federal  state and local government agencies and authorities 
these government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations  contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation  administration  performance and accounting 
many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable laws and contract provisions 
as a result of our government contracting  claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations  requirements or statutes 
we may also be subject to qui tam whistle blower litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the federal civil false claims act  which could include claims for up to treble damages 
further  if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated and we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting  including federally funded projects at the state level 
if our government contracts are terminated for any reason  or if we are suspended from government work  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue 
our long term debt and credit arrangements contain restrictive covenants and failure to meet these covenants could significantly harm our financial condition 
our long term debt and credit arrangements and related restrictive covenants are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in most cases  failure to meet the restrictive covenants would result in an immediate repayment of all amounts due and cancellation of open lines of credit 
additionally  failure to meet restrictive covenants related to our debt and credit agreements would trigger cross default provisions that would cause us to also be in default of our surety agreements 
although we have not had difficulty meeting these covenants in the past  failure to do so in the future could have material adverse effects on our business and financial condition 
our contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or  if realized  will be profitable 
projects reflected in our contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations  scope adjustments  time extensions or other changes 
such changes may impact the revenue and profit we ultimately realize on these projects 
the foregoing list is not exhaustive 
there can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact us 
these developments could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for these reasons  the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

the m company et al each lawsuit was brought by a single plaintiff who is seeking money damages by way of various causes of action  including strict product and market share liability  and alleges personal injuries caused by exposure to silica products and related materials during the plaintiffs use or association with sand blasting or grinding concrete 
the plaintiff in each lawsuit has categorized the defendants as equipment defendants  respirator defendants  premises defendants and sand defendants 
we have been identified as a sand defendant  meaning a party that manufactured  supplied or distributed silica containing products 
our preliminary investigation revealed that we have not knowingly sold or distributed abrasive silica sand for sandblasting  and therefore  we believe the probability of these lawsuits resulting in an incurrence of a material liability is remote 
we have been dismissed from sixteen other similar lawsuits 
hiawatha project dbe issues the hiawatha light rail transit hlrt project was performed by minnesota transit constructors mntc  a joint venture that consisted of gcco and other unrelated companies 
gcco was the managing partner of the joint venture  with a interest 
the minnesota department of transportation mndot is the contracting agency for this federally funded project 
the metropolitan council is the local agency conduit for providing federal funds to mndot for the hlrt project 
mndot and the us department of transportation office of inspector general oig each conducted a review of the disadvantaged business enterprise dbe program maintained by mntc for the hlrt project 
in addition  the us department of justice usdoj is conducting an investigation into compliance issues with respect to mntc s dbe program for the hlrt project 
mndot and the oig collectively  the agencies have initially identified certain compliance issues in connection with mntc s dbe program and  as a result  have determined that mntc failed to meet the dbe utilization criteria as represented by mntc 
although there has been no formal administrative subpoena issued  nor has a civil complaint been filed in connection with the administrative reviews or the investigation  mndot has proposed a monetary sanction of million against mntc and specified dbe training for personnel from the members of the mntc joint venture as a condition of awarding future projects to joint venture members of mntc on mndot and metropolitan council work 
mntc is fully cooperating with the agencies and the usdoj and  on july   presented its detailed written response to the initial determinations of the agencies as well as the investigation by the usdoj 
we have yet to receive a formal reply from the agencies or the usdoj  those entities instead preferring to engage in informal discussions in attempt to resolve the matter 
we cannot  however  rule out the possibility of a civil or criminal actions being brought against mntc or one or more of its members which could result in civil and criminal penalties 
us highway project gcco and our wholly owned subsidiary  granite northwest  inc are the members of a joint venture known as yaquina river constructors yrc which is currently constructing a new road alignment of us highway near eddyville  oregon under contract with the oregon department of transportation odot 
the project involves constructing seven miles of new road through steep and forested terrain in the coast range mountains 
during the fall and winter of  extraordinary rain events produced runoff that overwhelmed erosion control measures installed at the project and resulted in discharges to surface water in alleged violation of the stormwater permit 
the oregon department of justice is conducting a criminal investigation in connection with stormwater runoff from the project 
yrc and its members are fully cooperating in the investigation  but yrc does not know whether criminal charge civil lawsuits  if any  will be brought or against whom  as a result of the investigation 
therefore  we cannot estimate what  if any  criminal or civil penalty or conditional assessment may result from this investigation 

table of contents city of san diego fire debris cleanup in the aftermath of the san diego county wildfires  gcco bid for and was awarded a fixed unit price  variable quantity contract with the city of san diego to perform specified debris cleanup work 
gcco began work in november and completed the work in april in august  the city announced that it would conduct an independent audit of the project 
in december  the city s audit report was released with findings that while some gcco billings contained minor mistakes  rates paid to gcco appear to be generally reasonable 
gcco has reimbursed the city the undisputed overbilled amount of less than  the former san diego city attorney  after conducting a separate investigation of gcco s work on the project  filed a civil lawsuit in california superior court  county of san diego on october  against gcco and the one other contractor that had been awarded a similar cleanup contract with the city 
in the complaint  the city alleges both contractors knowingly presented to the city false claims for payment in violation of the california false claims act 
the city seeks trebled damages in an amount to be determined  and a civil penalty in the amount of  for each false claim made 
after the november election in which a new city attorney was elected  gcco and the new city attorney agreed to suspend the lawsuit to allow the city attorney time to complete its investigation 
gcco believes the allegations in the city s complaint to be without factual or legal basis and  therefore  the city s entitlement to relief sought under the california false claims act is remote 
gcco will vigorously defend itself against the allegations raised 
city of sacramento west el camino project in august  the city of sacramento and gcco entered into a contract for the construction of a public work improvement referred to as the west el camino widening and bridge replacement project 
during the course of the project  gcco excavated significantly more material than the city engineer s estimated quantity for that contract bid item 
gcco filed a complaint in the california superior court county of sacramento against the city in november seeking payment for the excess quantities 
in its defense to gcco s lawsuit  and on july  the city filed a cross complaint against gcco seeking relief pursuant to the california false claims act and asserting various other fraud and misrepresentation based causes of action 
the city s cross complaint sought  for each false claim  restitution and disgorgement of all earnings  punitive damages  attorney fees  costs and interest 
on january  this matter was resolved by settlement agreement in which neither party admitted fault  but paid gcco a portion of the amount gcco claimed for the excess quantities 
other legal proceedings government inquiries we are a party to a number of other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
from time to time  we also receive inquiries from public agencies seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction contracting requirements and related laws and regulations 
we believe that the nature and number of these proceedings and compliance inquiries are typical for a construction firm of our size and scope 
our litigation typically involves claims regarding public liability or contract related issues 
while management currently believes  after consultation with counsel  that the ultimate outcome of such proceedings and compliance inquiries which are currently pending  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations  cash flows and or financial position for the period in which the ruling occurs 
while any one of our pending legal proceedings is subject to early resolution as a result of our ongoing efforts to settle  whether or when any legal proceeding will resolve through settlement is neither predictable nor guaranteed

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are one of the largest heavy civil contractors and producers of construction materials in the united states 
we are engaged in the construction and improvement of streets  roads  highways and bridges as well as dams  airport infrastructure  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
we produce construction materials through the use of our extensive aggregate reserves and plant facilities 
we also operate a real estate development company on a significantly smaller scale 
we have offices in alaska  arizona  california  florida  nevada  new york  oregon  texas  utah and washington 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as contract backlog  available personnel  current utilization of equipment and other resources  our ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  contract backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
we have three operating segments granite west  granite east and granite land company 
the three primary economic drivers of our business are the overall health of the economy  federal  state and local public funding levels  both nationally and locally and population growth with the resulting private development 
the level of demand for our services will have a direct correlation to these drivers 
for example  a stagnant or declining economy will generally result in a reduced demand for construction in the private sector 
this reduced demand increases competition for private sector projects and will ultimately also increase competition in the public sector as companies migrate from bidding on scarce private sector work to projects in the public sector 
greater competition can reduce our revenue growth and or have a downward impact on gross profit margins 
in addition  a stagnant or declining economy tends to produce less tax revenue  thereby decreasing a source of funds available for spending on public infrastructure improvements 
there are funding sources that have been specifically earmarked for infrastructure spending  such as diesel and gasoline taxes  which are not as directly impacted by a stagnant or declining economy 
however  even these funding sources can be temporarily at risk as state and local governments struggle to balance their budgets 
additionally  high fuel prices can have a dampening effect on consumption  resulting in overall lower tax revenue 
conversely  higher public funding as well as an expanding or robust economy will generally increase demand for our services and provide opportunities for revenue growth and margin improvement 
our general and administrative costs include salaries and related expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing  provision for doubtful accounts and other costs to support our business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to the growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
these costs will vary depending on the number of projects in process in a particular area and the corresponding level of estimating activity 
for example  as large projects are completed or if the level of work slows down in a particular area  we will often re assign project employees to estimating and bidding activities until another project gets underway  temporarily allocating their salaries and related costs from cost of revenue to general and administrative expense 
additionally  our compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
the cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed over the vesting period of the restricted stock award generally three to five years 
depending on the mix of cash and restricted stock  these incentives can have the effect of materially altering general and administrative expenses from year to year 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies and estimates require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  the valuation of real estate held for development and sale and other long lived assets  and insurance estimates 
we evaluate all of our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition for construction contracts our contracts with our customers are primarily either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or cubic yards of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the expected unit cost in the bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform all the work profitably for the specified contract amount 
the percentage of fixed price contracts in our contract backlog decreased from approximately at december  to approximately at december  all state and federal government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized using the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related profit is deferred until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine what the estimated profit on the project will be with a reasonable level of assurance 
in the case of large  complex design build projects we may continue to defer profit recognition beyond the point of completion based on an evaluation of specific project risks 
the factors considered in this evaluation of risk associated with each design build project include the stage of design completion  the stage of construction completion  status of outstanding purchase orders and subcontracts  certainty of quantities  certainty of schedule and the relationship with the owner 
revenue from contract claims is recognized when we have a signed settlement agreement and payment is assured 
revenue from contract change orders  which occur in most large projects  is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
provisions are recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected when known 
the completion threshold for the start of contract profit recognition is applied to all percentage of completion projects unless and until we project a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a highly detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to provide materially reliable estimates 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  costs associated with added scope changes  extended overhead due primarily to owner and weather delays  subcontractor performance issues  changes in productivity expectations  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials 
the foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
substantial changes in cost estimates  particularly in our larger  more complex projects have had  and can in future periods have  a significant effect on our profitability 

table of contents valuation of real estate held for development and sale and other long lived assets real estate held for development and sale and other long lived assets  which include property  equipment and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value  which is generally determined based on the sum of the cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
in and our analyses determined that portions of our real estate held for development and sale were impaired 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges for the years ended and in the amount of million and a million  respectively 
the process of estimating future cash flows related to an asset involves significant judgment  including future cash inflows related to the use or eventual sale of the asset and future cash outflows related to the development or use of the asset 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions we used in testing for impairment are reasonable and supportable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
insurance estimates we carry insurance policies to cover various risks  primarily general liability and workers compensation  under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid 
the amounts that we are liable for generally range from the first million to million per occurrence 
we accrue for the estimated ultimate liability for incurred losses  both reported and unreported  using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified  if necessary  by recent events 
changes in our loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would result in a change in our assessment of the ultimate liability that could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position

the decreases in private sector and materials revenue were driven by the ongoing contraction of credit markets and residential construction in all geographic areas in which granite west operates 
we continue to see additional competition for the available public sector work  as competitors migrate from increasingly scarce private sector work

geographically  the largest decreases were experienced in the southeast and northeast due primarily to certain large projects nearing completion 
increases in the midwest and south resulted from revenue contributions from progress on a large design build project in st 
louis  missouri and project productivity on a bridge project in mississippi  respectively

granite land company revenue revenue from glc for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  glc s revenue is dependent on the timing of real estate sales transactions  which are relatively few in number and can cause variability in the timing of revenue and profit recognition 
the current real estate downturn and associated tightening of credit markets has had a direct impact on the anticipated timing of several glc development projects

while we continued to focus on selective bidding opportunities with higher bid margins  project awards during the year ended december  included a million freeway project in texas and a million transit project in new york 
we are a member of a joint venture team that is currently in pricing negotiations with houston metro for the design and construction of the proposed expansion of the houston rapid transit system  and received million in awards from houston metro for preliminary work associated with this project 
also  we received million in additional awards related to our share of a joint venture project to construct a transportation hub at the world trade center in new york

table of contents gross profit loss the following table presents gross profit loss by business segment for the respective periods gross profit loss years ended december  in thousands granite west percent of division revenue granite east percent of division revenue granite land company percent of division revenue other total percent of total revenue gross profit loss we recognize revenue only equal to cost  deferring profit recognition  until a project reaches completion 
in the case of large  complex design build projects  we may continue to defer profit recognition beyond the point of completion until such time as we believe we have enough information to make a reasonably dependable estimate of contract revenue and cost 
because we have a large number of projects at various stages of completion in granite west  this policy generally has a lesser impact on granite west s gross profit on a quarterly or annual basis 
however  granite east has fewer projects in process at any given time and those projects tend to be much larger than granite west projects 
as a result  granite east gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary significantly in periods where one or several very large projects reach our percentage of completion threshold and the deferred profit is recognized or conversely  in periods where contract backlog is growing rapidly and a higher percentage of projects are in their early stages with no associated gross profit recognition 
revenue from projects that have not yet reached our profit recognition threshold is as follows revenue from contracts with deferred profit years ended december  in thousands granite west granite east total revenue from contracts with deferred profit we do not recognize revenue from contract claims until we have a signed agreement and payment is assured and we do not recognize revenue from contract change orders until the contract owner has agreed to the change order in writing 
however  we do recognize the costs related to any contract claims or pending change orders in our forecasts when we are contractually obligated 
as a result  our gross profit as a percent of revenue can vary depending on the magnitude and timing of settlement of claims and change orders 
granite west gross profit as a percent of revenue for decreased to from for the decrease was primarily due to significantly lower gross profit margins on the sale of construction materials 
construction materials gross profit as a percent of materials sales for decreased to from for construction materials margins have been negatively impacted by lower demand from the private sector for our higher margin products  higher costs of certain raw materials such as diesel fuel and liquid asphalt  and a write down of inventory due to production in excess of estimated foreseeable forecast 
additionally  margins have been negatively impacted by the fixed costs of our plants not running at normal capacity 
these decreases were partially offset by the positive effect of project forecast changes of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
granite east gross profit as a percent of revenue for increased to from for the improved gross profit margin in was driven by favorable project forecast changes  projects reaching the state of completion allowing profit recognition  and the settlement of a significant claim associated with a large design build project nearing completion in southern california 
currently  there is only one project in granite east for which the profit recognition threshold has not been reached 
the positive effect of project forecast changes was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents when we experience significant contract forecast changes  we undergo a process that includes reviewing the nature of the changes to ensure that there are no material amounts that should have been recorded in a prior period rather than as a change in estimate for the current period

table of contents prior years revenue revenue from granite west for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared with the year ended december  our california revenue decreased million  or  in primarily due to the continued slowing of residential construction which led to decreases in both private sector construction revenue and revenue from the sale of construction materials 
these decreases were partially offset by increased california public sector revenue of million  or  primarily driven by a higher volume of projects available to bid 
our revenue from the west excluding california in included approximately million generated as a result of our acquisition of certain assets of the superior group of companies on april  other than northern nevada  our locations outside of california have generally been less impacted by the slowing of residential construction

contract backlog granite west contract backlog of million at december  was million  or  lower than at december  the decrease of million  or  in private sector contract backlog at december  compared with december  was primarily a result of the slowing demand for residential construction  particularly in certain california and nevada markets 
the decrease of million  or  in public sector contract backlog in california was largely due to increased competition for the available work as contractors migrated from the increasingly scarce private sector work 
additionally  the lower public sector contract backlog reflects progress on a million joint venture highway reconstruction project in utah that was awarded at the end of granite west project awards in the fourth quarter included a million highway reconstruction project near the california nevada border 
granite east contract backlog of billion at december  was million  or  lower than at december  the increase of  or  in contract backlog in the southeast was largely driven by the award in march of a million joint venture design build highway project in maryland 
the contract backlog increase in the southeast was offset by lower contract backlog in the other granite east geographic areas as we continued our strategy of bidding at higher margins in our home markets 
additional project awards during the year ended december  included a million freeway project in texas  a million turnpike project in florida and approximately million in additional awards related to our share of a joint venture project to construct a transportation hub at the world trade center in new york

table of contents outlook we anticipate to be a challenging year as a product of the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment and its impact on many of our customers 
however  we expect the diversity and resiliency of our business model will continue to be extremely valuable as we confront these challenging economic times 
in the west  while there is enough work to bid in the public sector  we expect competition to remain very strong throughout our focus this year will be on targeting those opportunities where we have a competitive advantage 
we are well positioned in our markets with our strong financial position  versatile construction capability  aggregate reserves  key plant facilities and  most importantly teams of experienced and dedicated people 
the outlook for our granite east business continues to be positive 
we will be pursuing several large projects this year 
funding for these projects is coming from various sources 
our strategy for this business has not changed and we remain very selective with regard to the projects we bid 
we will continue to focus on projects where we can utilize our construction expertise  mitigate risk and deliver acceptable margins 
with regard to our granite land company  our strategy in is to be flexible and patient in managing our investments 
several of our projects have long lead times  which afford us the ability to stage the timing of sales transactions 
we will continue to work on entitlements  construct improvements when prudent and take an opportunistic view of potential new investments 
the expected profitability for certain development activities could continue to deteriorate to a point that could cause us to recognize impairments if there is a continued decline in the residential and commercial real estate markets in which we are operating 
on the political front  there are many uncertainties surrounding federal and state transportation funding for the american recovery and reinvestment act recently signed into law provides funds for the construction of public infrastructure and facilities 
specific to transportation  the act provides billion for highways as well as billion for transit  billion for high speed rail  billion for the airport improvement program  and billion awarded in the form of competitive discretionary grants across the spectrum of surface transportation projects 
while infrastructure funding from the stimulus bill should give our markets a short term boost  our longer term focus will continue to be on the reauthorization of the federal highway bill  the current version of which will expire in september 
granite  along with other industry leaders and industry associations are actively engaging congress to develop a long term strategy to increase and stabilize transportation infrastructure funding levels 
in california we expect the recently passed budget compromise will stabilize california s fiscal situation 
california s constitutional officers and legislative leaders are hopeful that the fiscal plan will allow california to sell proposition b bonds into the marketplace and fund a full scale transportation program 
the compromise provides full funding of proposition as well as increased design build and public private partnership authority for transportation projects in the state 
while we are encouraged by the recent passage of the federal stimulus bill and budget agreement in california  it is too early for us to know to what degree these will impact our business 
with regard to raw materials costs  we are subject to energy and petroleum related price volatility as it relates to our use of diesel fuel for our rolling stock equipment  natural gas  propane and diesel fuel to heat our plants  as well as liquid asphalt for production of asphaltic concrete 
in  we experienced significant price volatility in all of these commodities and there is substantial uncertainty surrounding price trends for we continue to manage our exposure to these price changes by monitoring the costs of these commodities and pricing them into our projects and contracts accordingly 
some of our contracts include clauses for liquid asphalt and fuel escalation and de escalation that provide protection in the event that oil product prices change significantly 
we are exploring opportunities to better manage our exposure to commodity price volatility and take advantage of economies of scale through centralized purchasing where appropriate 
in summary  although we are cautious about our outlook for  we remain optimistic about the longer term opportunities ahead for our business 
our granite west business is poised to take advantage of its entrepreneurial business model in our granite east business is expected to continue to deliver positive results in we continue to focus on cost cutting and improvement initiatives to develop more efficient business processes 
overall  we are very optimistic about the long term view of our markets and are confident that our continued strategic investment into our construction materials business and the development of our people is important to increasing long term shareholder value 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing committed credit facility will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments  cash dividend payments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through the next twelve months 
if we experience a significant change in our business operating results or make a significant acquisition  we may need to acquire additional sources of financing  which  if available  may be limited by the terms of our existing debt covenants  or may require the amendment of our existing debt agreements 
december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents excluding consolidated joint ventures consolidated joint venture cash and cash equivalents total consolidated cash and cash equivalents short term and long term marketable securities total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our cash and cash equivalents are comprised of deposits and money market funds held with established national banks  and fixed income securities having remaining maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
cash and cash equivalents held by our consolidated joint ventures is for the working capital needs of each joint venture s project 
the decision to distribute cash must generally be made jointly by all of the partners and therefore these funds are not available for the working capital needs of granite 
our marketable securities include united states government obligations  municipal bonds and to a lesser extent  mutual funds 
primarily in response to deteriorating credit markets  we have generally not reinvested the proceeds of maturing securities and have retained these funds in cash and cash equivalents 
due to the current fiscal situation in california  we have received notification that progress payments on certain projects may be delayed 
if these payments are delayed we will be given the option to continue or suspend work 
if we continue to work we will be paid interest on the delayed payment amounts 
while the california budget has just recently passed  it may take some time before the affected funding sources are reestablished 
cash flows years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures 
table of contents cash provided by operating activities of million in represents a million increase from the amount provided by operating activities during this increase was primarily due to proceeds from the release of escrow funds to purchase the remaining shares of our wilder subsidiary and an increase in minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries due to higher profitability on construction joint ventures including the effects of a large settlement of claims on a large project in southern california 
this increase was partially offset by a change in the amount of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  net  primarily due to progress on projects that had received large mobilization payments in the prior year and cash payments for the remaining minority interest of our wilder subsidiary in cash used in investing activities of million for represents a million decrease from the amount used in due primarily to the effect of the wilder minority share purchase in and a decrease in the amount of cash used for business acquisitions in cash used in financing activities of million for represents a change of million from this change was largely attributable to the issuance of million in private placement debt in and the related payoff of our revolving lines of credit 
the remainder of the change was primarily due to decreased purchases of common shares in  the financing cash flow portion of the wilder minority share purchase and a decrease in contributions from our minority partners 
capital expenditures during the year ended december   we had capital expenditures of million compared to million during the year ended december  we currently anticipate spending between million and million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt production facilities  buildings  leasehold improvements  development of real estate projects and aggregate reserves 
the timing and amount of such expenditures can vary based on the progress of planned capital projects  the type and size of construction projects  changes in business outlook and other factors 

table of contents debt and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations under construction contracts other purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations total note asset retirement obligations associated with our owned and leased quarry properties see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been excluded from the above table as they are not contractual obligations 
these obligations represent the aggregate minimum principal maturities of long term debt and do not include interest 
these obligations represent the minimum rental commitments and minimum royalty requirements under all noncancellable operating leases 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase commitments for purchases of materials and subcontract services related to our current contract backlog 
these purchase commitments  are generally settled in less than one year 
these obligations represent firm purchase commitments for equipment and other goods and services not connected with our construction contract backlog which are individually greater than the timing of expected payment of deferred compensation is based on estimated dates of retirement 
actual dates of retirement could be different and would cause the timing of payments to change 
in addition to the above  as of december   we had approximately million in liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
these reserves are not included in the table above because we cannot estimate the timing of payments related to such reserves 
bank line of credit and letters of credit we have a million bank revolving line of credit  which allows for unsecured borrowings through june  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin based upon certain financial ratios calculated quarterly 
the margin was at december  the unused and available portion of this line of credit was million at december  we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which will expire between february and march we are generally required by the beneficiaries of these standby letters of credit to replace them upon expiration 
additionally  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december   approximately billion of our contract backlog was bonded 
a total of billion in performance bonds were outstanding as of december   which includes bonds for construction projects  both in process and completed contracts awaiting final acceptance by the owner 
generally  performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are generally released from the bonds when each contract is accepted by the owner 
the ability to maintain bonding capacity to support our current and future level of contracting requires that we maintain cash and working capital balances satisfactory to our sureties 
restrictive covenants under the terms of our senior notes and revolving line of credit require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and the maintenance of tangible net worth as defined 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  failure to comply with these covenants could cause the amounts due under the debt agreements to become currently payable 
share purchase authorization in  our board of directors authorized us to purchase  at management s discretion  up to million of our common stock 
during the year ended december   we purchased million common shares for a total of million under this share purchase program 
from the inception of this share purchase program in through december   we have purchased a total of million common shares for an aggregate cost of million 
all shares were retired upon acquisition 
at december   million of the million authorization was available for future common share purchases 

table of contents joint ventures  off balance sheet arrangements we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project and is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners 
we select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of their construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with us  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets  and our respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project 
under each joint venture agreement  one partner is designated as the sponsor 
the sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative  accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services 
we have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non sponsoring partner in others 
we also participate in various line item joint venture agreements under which each partner is responsible for performing certain discrete items of the total scope of contracted work 
the revenue for these discrete items is defined in the contract with the project owner and each venture partner bears the profitability risk associated with its own work 
all partners in a line item joint venture are jointly and severally liable for the completion of the total project under the terms of the contract with the project owner 
there is not a single set of books and records for a line item joint venture 
each partner accounts for its items of work individually as it would for any self performed contract 
we account for our portion of these contracts as project revenues and costs in our accounting system and include receivables and payables associated with our work in our consolidated financial statements 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners for both construction joint ventures and line item joint ventures provide that each party will assume and pay its share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december   approximately million of work  representing either our partners proportionate share of unconsolidated construction joint ventures or work that our partners are directly responsible for in line item joint ventures  had yet to be completed 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines prohibit investments in auction rate and asset backed securities 
they also limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the portfolio is limited to an average maturity of no more than one year from date of purchase 
on an ongoing basis we monitor credit ratings  financial condition and other factors that could impact the carrying amount of our investment portfolio 
marketable securities  consisting of us government obligations  agencies and municipal bonds  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
we are exposed to financial market risks due largely to changes in interest rates  which we have managed primarily by managing the maturities in our investment portfolio 
we currently do not have any business transactions in foreign currencies 
the fair value of our short term held to maturity investment portfolio and related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the fair value of our long term held to maturity investment portfolio may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  anticipated declining interest rates will negatively impact our investment income 
at december  we had outstanding i senior notes payable of million which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments that began in  ii senior notes payable of million which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments that began in and iii senior notes payable of million  which carry a fixed rate interest of per annum with principal payments due in five equal annual installments beginning in the table below presents principal amounts due by year and related weighted average interest rates for our cash and cash equivalents  held to maturity investments and significant debt obligations as of december  in thousands thereafter total assets cash  cash equivalents and held to maturity investments weighted average interest rate liabilities fixed rate debt senior notes payable weighted average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term held to maturity investments approximate the principal amounts reflected above based on the generally short maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our long term held to maturity investments approximates the principal amounts above due to the relatively minor difference between the effective yields of these investments and rates currently available on similar instruments 
rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt 
based on the fixed borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of the senior notes payable was approximately million as of december  and million as of december
