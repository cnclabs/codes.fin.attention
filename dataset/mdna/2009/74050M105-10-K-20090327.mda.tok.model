management s discussion and analysis december  forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth or lack thereof  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
the words may  could  should  would  will  believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  predict  continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the 
consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

management s discussion and analysis december  allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
business acquisitions and impairment of goodwill for acquisitions  premier is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company s balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of the company s banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company s aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company s aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management s impairment analysis

management s discussion and analysis december  summary financial results premier had net income of million in compared to million of net income reported for the year net income increased in as a result of higher interest income and non interest income as well as lower interest expense all of which was partially offset by higher non interest expense 
the increases in each of these categories was primarily the result of the increase in operations from the acquisitions of citizens first bank citizens first and traders bankshares  inc traders  both of which occurred at the close of business on april  the operating results of citizens first and traders are included in the consolidated financial statements of premier only from the date of acquisition 
net income in was million 
the increase in over was the result of an increase in interest income due to a greater average volume of loans outstanding  a greater volume of average federal funds sold outstanding  higher yields on all earning assets  an increase in secondary market mortgage income  and a reduction in the operating costs of the company 
net income in was the result of an increase in interest income due to a greater volume of loans outstanding  higher yields on all earning assets  a negative provision for loan losses  and a reduction in the net operating costs of the company 
basic earnings per share were in compared to in and to in the decrease in earnings per share in resulted from the increase in the average shares outstanding related to the common stock issued as part of the merger consideration of citizens first and traders as more fully described in

the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years 
return on average assets roa measures how effectively premier utilizes its assets to produce net income 
it also facilitates the analysis of earnings performance of different sized organizations 
in  premier increased the size its balance sheet from million in total assets at the end of to million at the end of  largely due to the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the increase in asset size will generally result in higher dollars of income earned and expenses incurred 
a detailed review of the components of roa will help analyze premier s performance without regard to changes in its size 
premier s net income in resulting in an roa of  a decrease from the roa in and the roa in as shown in the table  fully taxable equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets reached its highest level in five years in at 
in  this percentage decreased to as the increase in average earning assets from traders and citizens first did not result in a similar percentage increase in net interest income 
in  net credit income was of average earning assets and continued to increase in both and again in in  minimal provisions for loan losses were recorded and thus there was little reduction from the increase in net interest income 
in  negative provisions for loan losses were recorded which served to help increase net credit income to 
this increase in net credit income as a percent of average earning assets was complemented by an increase in non interest income as a percent of average earning assets and a reduction in non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets when compared to the previous two years 
in  while net interest income continued to increase

management s discussion and analysis december  net credit income was lower than as a result of minimal negative provisions for loan losses recorded in however  in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets reached its highest level in the past five years while non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets continued to decline 
in  minimal provisions for loan losses reduced an already lower net interest income as a percent of average earning assets  resulting in net credit income of of average earning assets 
in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets declined somewhat  returning to the level achieved in however  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets continued to decline in resulting in the lowest ratio over the past five years

this ratio compares to in  the lowest ratio reported in the last five years  in  in  and in the increase in net overhead was largely the result of a lower ratio of non interest income to average earning assets due to lower secondary market mortgage commissions overall and the non interest income ratio of the acquired banks 
the decrease in net overhead was the result of increases in premier s non interest income related to electronic banking income and secondary market mortgage commissions  plus decreases in non interest expenses related to staff costs and the accelerated amortization of trust preferred issuance costs recorded in but not

premier s roe was compared to in and realized in roe decreased in due to an increase in average equity as a result of the common stock issued to acquire traders and citizens first 
roe decreased slightly in as average equity increased at a faster pace than average assets resulting in a decrease in the multiplier of average assets to average equity

management s discussion and analysis december  loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during average loans increased in by million or over following a million or increase in over the increase is largely attributable to the acquisitions of traders and citizens first  which added million in average total loans during the year 
excluding the acquisitions  average total loans increased by million or in from this increase is the result of growth in premier s ohio and west virginia loan markets 
in  premier realized a million or increase in average outstanding loans in its ohio markets  and a million or increase in its west virginia market excluding traders and citizens first 
these increases more than offset the slight  or decrease in average total loans in premier s kentucky markets 
the increases follow a million or increase in average outstanding loans in its ohio markets  a million or increase in its kentucky markets and a million or increase in its west virginia markets in total loans at december  increased by million or from the total at december  this increase follows a million or increase in from total loans at december  the significant increase in is primarily due to the million of period end loans from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the remaining million or increase in was the result of significant increase in loan demand in premier s markets 
the modest increase in is primarily the result of sluggish loan demand coupled with a higher level of loan payoffs 
loans secured by real estate  which in total constituted approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december   consist of a diverse portfolio of predominantly single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is part of the collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan at the time of origination 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also originates mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market and recognizes non interest income upon the sale of those mortgages in the form of commissions and servicing release fees 
premier has not engaged in the solicitation of so called sub prime or interest only mortgages 
premier uses an experienced staff underwriter to ensure the completeness of the borrowers loan application and documentation and to ensure that the loans meet the standards required by prospective loan purchasers 
additional information regarding the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold is contained in premier s consolidated statements of cash flows presented elsewhere in this annual report

management s discussion and analysis december  commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plan 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

note to the consolidated financial statements 
total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued non accrual loans  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms to enable a delinquent borrower to repay and accruing loans past due days or more  were million or of total assets at year end these amounts compare to million of total non performing assets or of total assets at year end  the lowest levels over the past five years 
the increase from end of is largely due to the million of non performing assets at december  at the acquired traders bank 
in addition to the non accrual loans at traders bank  in a million increase in non accrual loans was largely offset by decreases in loans past due days or more and restructured loans 
while the ratio of non performing assets to total assets at the end of was higher than the end of  it was still lower than any of the previous three years presented in the table above 
the decrease in total non performing assets in was largely due a million decrease in non accrual loans and a continued decrease in oreo property 
these decreases offset the increase in restructured loans  while loans past due days or more and still accruing remained virtually unchanged 
the decrease in was largely due to the million reduction in oreo property  which was partially offset by an increase in non accrual loans 
as the collection or rehabilitation of previously delinquent loans and charge offs of loans determined to be uncollectible continued in  these efforts were offset by other loans newly placed on non accrual status 
in  the level of non accrual loans declined primarily as a result of loan payoffs as well as partial or complete loan charge offs 
management believes the estimated potential losses related to delinquent loans to be adequately provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
these non performing assets were included in the analyses that supported the recording of provisions for loan loss during the second  third and fourth quarters of as management s efforts to collect the non performing assets at traders bank continue  matured loans are only renewed using premier s strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
as previously demonstrated by premier s history  management is committed to continuing to reduce its level of non performing assets and maintaining strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in non accrual loans and loans days past due 
premier s efforts at its other affiliate banks in and were masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
by december   total non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million

management s discussion and analysis december  the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans where management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
premier had no commitments to provide additional funds on non accrual loans at december  for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations 
during premier recorded  of writedowns and losses on the disposition of oreo properties  net of gains  while in premier recognized a  net profit on the disposition of oreo properties  net of writedowns 
during premier realized  net profit on the disposition of oreo properties 
although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than originally contracted terms 
during  approximately  of interest was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  while approximately  would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier s risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are usually determined to be impaired 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial conditions and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed assessing the present value of estimated future cashflows using the loan s existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in a given loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
in  premier recorded  of additional provisions for loan losses 
conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions include greater than anticipated recoveries  a reduction in the historical loss ratios  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
all of these events occurred in varying degrees during and and resulted in  of negative provisions during and  of negative provisions during at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans 
while the total allowance increased by million from the million allowance at the end of  the ratio to total loans decreased slightly from the of total year end loans at december  the increase in the allowance in is largely due to the million allowance for loan losses acquired via the purchase of traders and citizens first banks 
the slight decrease in the ratio to total year end loans is largely the result of lower estimates of required allocations of the allowance to impaired loans due to a combination of collections of previously impaired loans and improved loan to collateral values on existing impaired loans 
the allowance for loan losses was also reduced by the  of net charge offs in which was only partially offset by the  of additional provisions for loan losses during the year 
the decrease in the allowance in compared to was primarily the result of the  of negative provisions for loan losses coupled with  of net charge offs recorded during the year 
the decrease in the allowance in was primarily the result of the million of negative provisions for loan losses recorded during the year  as charge offs in were nearly offset by recoveries 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above

management s discussion and analysis december  the following table provides a detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years

management s discussion and analysis december  losses were charged to earnings in the second  third and fourth quarters which more than offset a negative provision for losses in the first quarter 
in  a negative provision was recorded during the second quarter which exceeded the quarterly provisions recorded during the other three quarters of the year 
in  negative provisions were recorded in each of the four quarters of the year 
the negative provisions were recorded primarily as result of realized collections of previously impaired loans whereby estimated losses were not realized as previously estimated and assigned to the loan 
in addition  premier has been successful in recovering some of its previously charged off loans 
these positive events as well as the ongoing reduction in premier s historical loss ratios resulted in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and  thus  negative provisions were warranted 
the negative provisions for loan losses totaled  in and  in future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk 
premier continually evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  and changes in the provision are based on the estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
net charge offs in totaled  as  of loans charged off were partially offset by  of recoveries of loans previously charged off 
net charge offs in totaled  as  of loans charged off were nearly offset by  of recoveries of loans previously charged off 
net charge offs in decreased to just  as  of recoveries nearly offset  of charge offs recorded during the year 
in  farmers deposit bank recorded  of net recoveries and provided over of the company s total recoveries for in  farmers deposit bank recorded  of net recoveries and provided over of the company s total recoveries for in  farmers deposit bank recorded  of net recoveries and provided nearly of the company s total recoveries for these recoveries are primarily the result of continued collection efforts of the significant number and amount of loans charged off at farmers deposit bank in through approximately  or of the net charge offs and million  or of the premier s net charge offs were at farmers deposit bank 
the level of future recoveries is likely to decrease as the level of past charge offs has decreased

management s discussion and analysis december  a significant effort to reduce its past due and non performing loans by reviewing loan files  using the courts to bring borrowers current with the terms of their loan agreements and or the foreclosure and sale of oreo properties 
as in the past  when these plans are executed  premier may experience increases in non performing loans and non performing assets 
furthermore  any resulting increases in loans placed on non accrual status will have a negative impact on future loan interest income 
also  as these plans are executed  other loans may be identified that would necessitate additional charge offs and potentially additional provisions for loan losses 
premier continues to monitor and evaluate the impact that national housing market price declines may have on its local markets and collateral valuations as management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while some price deterioration is expected  it is not currently anticipated that premier s markets will be impacted as severely as other areas of the country due to the historically modest increases in real estate values in the company s markets 
these factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which at december  was of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans

management s discussion and analysis december  investment portfolio and other earning assets investment securities averaged million in  up million or from the million averaged in this increase follows an million or decrease in from the million averaged in the significant increase in is largely due to the million of average investment securities from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the remaining million or increase is largely due the declining interest rate environment during the year 
as rates began falling  investable funds held in federal funds sold were used to purchase high quality investment securities to achieve a greater yield over a longer period of maturity 
yields on federal funds sold rise and fall in direct correlation with interest rate changes made by the federal reserve board in establishing national economic policy 
investment security yields are based on a number of pricing factors including but not limited to coupon rate  time to maturity and issuer credit quality 
generally  in investment security yields were higher than the yield that could be earned on federal funds sold 
during  as investments matured  not all funds were reinvested in the investment portfolio 
some funds were used to satisfy loan growth  deposit withdrawals and debt payments 
furthermore  in contrast to  during the first half of  bond reinvestment yields were not as attractive as the yield on highly liquid federal funds sold 
consequently  funds from maturing investments were less likely to be reinvested in bonds 
at december   the amount of investments totaled million  up million or from december  the significant increase in investments is largely due to the million of investments at december  from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first  leaving million of the increase from internal growth 
this increase follows a million increase in from the balance at december  as the federal reserve board began lowering the federal funds rate in the latter portion of and continued to do so at various times throughout  bond yields have become more attractive than the yield on federal funds sold 
thus  to optimize interest income  premier has begun increasing the amount of funds it has invested in high quality debt securities

this increase more than offset the million or decrease in average federal funds sold of premier s other affiliate banks 
this decrease was the result of using some of the available federal funds sold to fund loans and purchase higher yielding investment securities 
as shown in the consolidated average balance sheets and net interest income analysis above  on average  the yield on federal funds sold dropped to in  significantly less than the average yield on total investment securities in in contrast  during the latter part of and first part of  bond yields were not as attractive as the yield on highly liquid federal funds sold and funds from maturing investments were less likely to be invested in bonds 
thus  average federal funds sold increased by million or in from the million averaged in as shown in the consolidated average balance sheets and net interest income analysis above  on average  federal funds sold yielded in and in in each year  this yield was higher than the yield earned on us treasury and agency securities as well as mortgage backed securities 
fluctuations in federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report 
funding sources in response to the federal reserve policy to reduce market interest rates by lowering the target federal funds rate  in premier began cutting its rates paid on its interest bearing deposits 
this change follows a three year period during which premier was raising the rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to the increase in market interest rates 
as a result  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in  and the paid in the basis point decrease in was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit and other time deposits  which made up of the total average interest bearing liabilities in other rate decreases on deposits in include a basis point decrease on now and money market accounts and a basis point decrease in savings deposits 
likewise  in premier decreased the rate paid on its short term borrowings  primarily repurchase agreements with deposit customers  basis points 
also in response to the decrease in market interest rates initiated by the federal reserve  the rate paid on premier s long term borrowings decreased as a result of the floating rate terms of the borrowings 
in  the average rate paid on other borrowings decreased basis points to 
the company s fhlb advances are fixed rate debt and thus decreased only as a result of payments and maturities of higher rate advances

due to alternative sources of investment and an ever increasing sophistication of customers in funds management techniques to maximize return on their money  competition for funds has become more intense 
other financial institutions that compete in local markets with premier that have a need to increase liquidity offer special above market rate deposit products to attract additional funds 
premier s banks periodically offer special rate products to retain their deposit base or attract additional deposits 
premier s deposits  on average  increased by million or in following a million or increase in from average deposits 
the increase in average deposits was largely due to the million of average deposits from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the remaining million or increase in average deposits was largely due to a million or increase in non interest bearing deposits  a million or increase in savings deposits and a million increase in money market and other interest bearing transaction oriented deposits 
the increase in average deposits was from a combination of a million increase in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits plus a million increase in non interest bearing deposits 
these increases more than offset a million decrease in average now and money market deposits 
during  as rates paid on certificates of deposits increased  particularly short term certificates of deposit  customers reallocated their funds from lower yielding transactional deposits such as now and money market accounts to these short term certificates of deposit 
in addition  some public fund and tax exempt organization deposits were reestablished as repurchase agreements in and again in average repurchase agreements increased by million or in following a million or increase in over average repurchase agreements

non interest bearing deposits are more susceptible to withdrawal and therefore may provide challenges to maintaining adequate liquidity 
see the additional discussion on liquidity below

in  average interest bearing deposits increased by million or 
the increase was largely due to the million of average interest bearing deposits from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the remaining million increase in average interest bearing deposits in was primarily from an increase in average savings deposits and average money market and other transaction oriented deposits 
due to the significant decrease in rates paid on certificates of deposit during  customers are taking a wait and see approach and are not willing to commit their funds for a longer term low yielding certificate of deposit 
instead the trend has been to keep their deposits readily accessible by placing the funds in savings accounts and transaction oriented interest bearing accounts 
in  average interest bearing deposits increased by million or 
the increase was primarily from an increase in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits as customers sought out higher yielding short term special rates 
while offering some special certificate of deposit rates  in premier continued to focus on building its base of customer relationships by offering more convenient electronic banking products to its non interest bearing deposit customers 
premier did realize a shift in its interest bearing deposits from lower cost interest bearing transaction accounts to certificates of deposit as customers moved their funds to take advantage of the rising interest rates paid on these certificates 
the result was a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits in however  premier also realized an increase in its average savings deposits in the following table provides information on the maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  maturity of time deposits  or more december  dollars in thousands maturing months or less maturing over months maturing over months maturing over months total

management s discussion and analysis december  other funding sources for premier include short and long term borrowings 
premier s short term borrowings primarily consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase with commercial  public entity and tax exempt organization customers 
these are short term non fdic insured deposit like products that are secured by the pledging of investment securities in premier s investment portfolio or by purchasing insurance through the federal home loan bank fhlb 
also included in short term borrowings are federal funds purchased from other banks and overnight borrowings from the fhlb or the federal reserve bank frb discount window 
these short term borrowings fluctuate depending on near term funding needs and as part of premier s management of its asset liability mix 
in  short term borrowings averaged million  up million or from the average in in  short term borrowings averaged million  up million or from the average in the increase in both years is largely due to an increase in repurchase agreements which were newly offered by two of premier s subsidiary banks late in long term borrowings consist of fhlb borrowings by premier s banks  other borrowings by the parent holding company and  prior to  debt issued in the form of subordinated debentures to an unconsolidated trust subsidiary 
fhlb advances  on average  declined by or  in  following a or million decrease in the decrease in is largely due to regularly scheduled principal payments plus additional penalty free prepayments as permitted to be made by the fhlb 
the decrease in was the result of a first quarter prepayment of million of amortizing fhlb advances in an effort to reduce premier s cost of funds rate 
these advances had contractual fixed rates between and  averaging 
in addition to the prepayment in the first quarter of  premier made all of its scheduled principal payments in and took advantage of penalty free prepayment opportunities as they became available 
premier uses fixed rate fhlb advances from time to time to fund certain residential and commercial loans as well to maximize investment opportunities as part of its interest rate risk management 
at december   fhlb advances totaled million which included million borrowed on an overnight basis 
the remaining million of amortizing fhlb advances had repayment schedules from seventeen to forty two months with million maturing in in  premier refinanced the remaining million of its junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures subordinated debentures that were due in the refinancing was accomplished using two separate bank borrowings at the parent company and million of cash held by the parent in its subsidiary banks

management s discussion and analysis december  asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model developed by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points  but never below zero 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects that net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets

net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  up from the million earned in which follows a increase in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier s size 
the increase in net interest income in is largely due to the million of fully tax equivalent net interest income from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
the remaining premier affiliate banks realized a  or decrease in net interest income in this decrease in net interest income in is largely due to a decrease in interest income from loans and federal funds sold partially offset by an increase in interest income on investments 
the decrease in interest income was significantly offset  however  by decreases in interest expense on deposits  short term debt and long term debt 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  increases in the volume of earning assets such as loans  investments and federal funds sold primarily due to the acquisitions of traders and citizens first increased premier s interest income by million 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in interest income on those earning assets largely due to the decline in yields earned on the loan portfolio and federal fund sold 
also shown in the table below  interest expense on deposits increased by million in due to a higher volume of now and money market deposit accounts plus certificates of deposit 
this increase in volume interest bearing deposits is largely due to deposits from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first 
interest expense in increased further still due to higher average volumes of short term borrowings and other borrowings 
the million of additional interest expense in from the increase in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities was more than offset by the million decrease in interest expense due to decreases in the rates paid on deposits  short term borrowings and long term borrowings 
the combined effect was to increase net interest income by  for the year 
the increase in net interest income in is largely due to an increase in interest income from loans  investments and federal funds sold partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  increases in the yields on loans  investments  and other earnings assets increased premier s interest income by million in this increase was complemented by a  increase in interest income due to the higher volume of average loans outstanding and a  increase in interest income due to the higher volume of average federal funds sold outstanding in interest income was decreased by  however  due to a lower volume of average investment securities outstanding

the average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased the most at basis points  while interest bearing transaction accounts increased on average by only basis points in and savings accounts by increased basis points 
while the rates paid on premier s short term borrowings remained virtually unchanged at  the rates paid on other borrowings increased by basis points to and the rates paid on fhlb advances increased by basis points to 
the rates paid on other borrowings increased as premier refinanced its subordinated debt with floating prime rate and below prime rate loans in resulting in significant interest expense savings 
the rates paid on fhlb advances increased as a result of the prepayment of certain amortizing advances at one affiliate bank while leaving higher rate fixed maturity advances at another bank 
the overall result of increasing rates paid on deposits and rate decreases resulting from debt refinancing was to increase the overall cost of funds by basis points to  up from in and in as a result  premier s net interest spread decreased by basis points  but the net interest margin increased by basis points to in  up from in further discussion of interest income is included in the section of this report entitled balance sheet analysis

accelerated trust preferred issuance costs were recognized in at the time of issuance  the costs to originate the trust preferred securities were capitalized 
the costs were being amortized over the year life of the securities which were scheduled to mature in and were recorded as an adjustment to interest expense

management s discussion and analysis december  because the fdic s deposit insurance fund fell below prescribed levels in  the fdic has announced increased premiums for all insured depository institutions  including premier s subsidiary banks  in order to begin recapitalizing the fund 
in addition  the fdic has proposed an additional basis point emergency assessment on insured depository institutions to be paid on september   which could be decreased by the fdic in certain events occur prior to the assessment date 
these changes and proposed changed if enacted will result in potentially significant increases in deposit insurance expense for premier in amortization of intangibles began in as a result of the core deposit intangible asset from the acquisitions of traders and citizens first

applicable income taxes premier recognized million of income tax expense in this amount compares to million of income tax expense recorded in and million of income tax expense recorded in premier s effective tax rate was in  up slightly from the in but down from the in premier s effective tax rate in decreased primarily as a results of death benefits received from a former officer s life insurance policy which were not subject to income tax

these activities help to reduce premier s tax rate from the statutory rate

note to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one effect is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report
