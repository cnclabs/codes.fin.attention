overview our business we are a vertically integrated pharmaceutical company that performs basic research and develops  manufactures  markets and sells branded prescription pharmaceutical products and animal health products 
by vertically integrated  we mean that we have the following capabilities research and development distribution manufacturing sales and marketing packaging business development quality control and assurance regulatory management our branded prescription pharmaceuticals include neuroscience products primarily pain medicines  hospital products  and legacy brands 
the animal health business is focused on medicated feed additives mfas and water soluble therapeutics primarily for poultry  cattle  and swine 
our corporate strategy is focused on specialty markets  particularly specialty driven prescription pharmaceutical markets 
we believe our target markets have significant potential and our organization is aligned accordingly 
our growth in specialty markets is achieved through organic growth and acquisitions 
under our corporate strategy we work to achieve organic growth by maximizing the potential of our currently marketed products through sales and marketing and prudent product life cycle management 
by product life cycle management  we mean the extension of the economic life of a product  including seeking and gaining necessary related governmental approvals  by such means as securing from the us food and drug administration  which we refer to as the fda  additional approved uses indications for our products  developing and producing different strengths  producing different package sizes  developing new dosage forms  and developing new product formulations 
our strategy also focuses on growth through the acquisition of novel branded prescription pharmaceutical products in various stages of development and the acquisition of prescription pharmaceutical technologies  particularly those products and technologies that we believe have significant market potential and complement the commercial footprint we have established in the neuroscience and hospital markets 
using our internal resources and a disciplined business development process  we strive to be a leader in developing and commercializing innovative  clinically differentiated therapies and technologies in these target  specialty driven markets 
we may also seek company acquisitions that add products or products in development  technologies or sales and marketing capabilities to our existing platforms or that otherwise complement our operations 
we also work to achieve organic growth by continuing to develop investigational drugs  as we have a commitment to research and development and advancing the products and technologies in our development pipeline 
we market our branded prescription pharmaceutical products primarily through a dedicated sales force to general family practitioners  internal medicine physicians  neurologists  pain specialists  surgeons and hospitals across the united states and in puerto rico 
branded prescription pharmaceutical products are innovative 
table of contents products sold under a brand name that have  or previously had  some degree of market exclusivity 
when we refer to branded prescription pharmaceutical products  we mean branded prescription pharmaceutical products that are intended for humans 
our animal health products are marketed through a staff of trained sales and technical service and marketing employees  many of whom are veterinarians and nutritionists 
we have sales offices in the us  europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia 
elsewhere  our animal health products are sold primarily through the use of distributors and other third party sales companies 
recent developments acquisition of alpharma inc on december   we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of the class a common stock of alpharma inc alpharma at a price of per share in cash  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
as a result of the transaction  alpharma is now a wholly owned subsidiary of king 
the acquisition was funded with available cash on hand  borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  as amended on december   and borrowings of million under a term loan 
alpharma has a growing branded prescription pharmaceutical franchise in the us pain market with its flector patch diclofenac epolamine topical patch  and a pipeline of new pain medicines led by embeda tm  a formulation of long acting morphine that is designed to provide controlled pain relief and deter certain common methods of misuse and abuse 
alpharma is also a global leader in the development  registration  manufacture and marketing of mfas and water soluble therapeutics for food producing animals  including poultry  cattle and swine 
we believe our acquisition of alpharma is particularly significant because it strengthens our portfolio and development pipeline of pain management products  and increases our capabilities and expertise in this important market 
the development pipeline provides us with both near term and long term revenue opportunities and the animal health business further diversifies our revenue base 
as a result  we believe this acquisition creates a stronger foundation for sustainable  long term growth for our company 
contemporaneous with our acquisition of alpharma and in accordance with a consent order with the us federal trade commission  we divested the rights to alpharma s kadian morphine sulfate long acting to actavis elizabeth  llc actavis 
pursuant to the divestiture  we will receive from actavis future quarterly payments of up to an aggregate of million in cash based on the achievement of certain kadian quarterly gross profit related milestones for the period beginning january  and ending june  in connection with the divestiture  we recorded a receivable equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the quarterly gross profit related milestones 
there was no gain or loss recorded as a result of the divestiture 
potential generic substitution for skelaxin on january  the us district court for the eastern district of new york  in the case of king pharmaceuticals  inc  et al 
v 
eon labs  inc  case no 
cv dgt  issued an order ruling invalid united states patent nos 
 and  two patents related to skelaxin 
the order was issued without the benefit of a hearing in response to eon labs motion for summary judgment 
we plan to appeal  upon the entry of an appropriate judgment  and intend to vigorously defend our interests 
the entry of the order may lead to generic versions of skelaxin entering the market sooner than previously anticipated  which would likely cause net sales of skelaxin to decline significantly 
also  in january  we entered into an agreement with corepharma  llc corepharma granting corepharma a license to launch an authorized generic version of skelaxin in december  or earlier under certain conditions 
following the decision of the district court  our senior management team conducted an extensive examination of the company and developed a restructuring initiative designed to partially offset the potential decline in skelaxin sales in the event that a generic competitor entered the market 
this initiative includes  
table of contents based on an analysis of our strategic needs a reduction in sales  marketing and other personnel  leveraging of staff  expense reductions and additional controls over spending  and reorganization of sales teams 
we estimate that  in connection with the restructuring initiative  we will incur total restructuring costs of between  and  all of which are expected to be incurred and expensed during the first half of and almost all of which will be cash expenditures 
these costs all relate to severance pay and other employee termination expenses 
the restructuring charges include employee termination costs associated with a workforce reduction of approximately employees  including approximately people in our sales force 
branded prescription pharmaceuticals development advances embeda tm the embeda tm new drug application nda was submitted to the fda in june utilizing proprietary technology  embeda tm  which contains long acting morphine pellets  each with a sequestered core of naltrexone  an opioid antagonist  has a proposed indication for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous  around the clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time 
the formulation is designed to work such that if taken as directed  the morphine would relieve pain while the sequestered naltrexone would pass through the body with no intended clinical effect 
if embeda tm capsules were crushed or chewed  however  the naltrexone would be released  mitigating the euphoric effect that might otherwise be caused by the morphine under these circumstances 
we acquired embeda tm on december  as part of our acquisition of alpharma 
in december  the fda informed us that it is continuing its review of the nda 
remoxy the remoxy nda was submitted to the fda in june on december   we received a complete response letter from the fda with respect to the nda for remoxy  requiring additional non clinical information to support approval 
we are working with our partner  pain therapeutics  inc  to complete an assessment of the complete response letter and prepare a written response 
we  together with pti plan to meet with the fda during the second quarter of to discuss the response  following which we expect to have a better understanding of the additional steps and the time required to obtain approval 
remoxy is a unique long acting formulation of oral oxycodone with a proposed indication for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous  around the clock  opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of time 
this formulation uses the oradur tm platform technology which provides a unique physical barrier that is designed to provide controlled pain relief and resist certain common methods used to extract the opioid more rapidly than intended as can occur with currently available products 
common methods used to cause a rapid extraction of an opioid include crushing  chewing  and dissolution in alcohol 
these methods are typically used to cause failure of the controlled release dosage form  resulting in dose dumping of oxycodone  or the immediate release of the active drug 
acurox tablets an nda for acurox oxycodone hcl niacin tablets was submitted to the fda in december acurox  a patented  orally administered  immediate release tablet containing oxycodone hcl as its sole active analgesic ingredient  has a proposed indication for the relief of moderate to severe pain 
acurox tablets use the patented aversion technology of acura pharmaceuticals  inc  which is designed to deter misuse and abuse by intentional swallowing of excess quantities of tablets  intravenous injection of dissolved tablets and nasal snorting of crushed tablets 
attempts to extract oxycodone from an acurox tablet by dissolving it in liquid results in the formation of a viscous gel which is intended to sequester the opioid and deter iv injection 
crushing an acurox tablet for the purposes of nasal snorting releases an ingredient that is intended to cause nasal irritation and thereby discourage this method of misuse and abuse 
swallowing excessive 
table of contents numbers of acurox tablets releases niacin in quantities that are intended to cause unpleasant and undesirable side effects that may potentially deter this method of misuse and abuse 
corvue tm binodenoson for injection in december  we submitted an nda for corvue tm to the fda 
corvue tm is a cardiac pharmacologic stress spect single photon emission computed tomographic imaging agent intended for use in patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease who are unable to perform a cardiac exercise stress test 
in the nda  we are requesting fda approval of corvue tm as an adjunct to non invasive myocardial perfusion imaging tests to detect perfusion abnormalities in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease 
t in december  we initiated the phase ii clinical trial program evaluating the efficacy and safety of t  our investigational oral drug formulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
t  a new chemical entity  is an adenosine a allosteric enhancer that increases the effectiveness of the body s endogenous adenosine to treat neuropathic pain 
the phase ii clinical trial is a multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study assessing the analgesic efficacy and safety of t in subjects with postherpetic neuralgia and its associated pain 
the study is expected to enroll approximately patients in up to study centers and will evaluate two doses of t and placebo utilizing a parallel design 
each patient will complete a day screening period  a day treatment period  and a day post treatment period 
branded prescription pharmaceuticals promoted portfolio developments avinza new mandates of the food and drug administration amendments act of fdaaa authorize the fda to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems as part of the new drug approval process if the agency believes that it is needed to ensure that a proposed new drug s benefits outweigh its risks 
the law also authorizes the agency to require a rems for certain drugs approved before fdaaa was signed into law 
a rems can include a medication guide  patient package insert  a communication plan  elements to ensure safe use and an implementation schedule  and must include a timetable for assessment of the rems 
elements to ensure safe use include requiring that healthcare providers have particular training or be certified  pharmacies  practitioners or healthcare settings that dispense the drug be specially certified  the drug be dispensed to patients only in certain healthcare settings  the drug be dispensed to patients with evidence of safe use conditions  each patient be subject to certain monitoring  and or each patient using the drug be enrolled in a registry 
on february   the fda sent a letter to the manufacturers of previously approved  currently marketed long acting opioid drug products  including us as manufacturer of avinza  indicating that this class of drugs will be required to have a rems 
fda has determined that a rems is required to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks of use of certain opioid products in non opioid tolerant individuals  abuse  and overdose  both accidental and intentional 
the agency has announced its intention to consult all relevant stakeholders  including manufacturers  pharmacies  healthcare practitioners  patient groups and others in developing this class wide rems of long acting opioids 
in the first of a series of such meetings  the fda has invited those companies that market the affected opioid drugs to meet with the agency on march  to discuss development of such a class wide rems 
king currently has a risk management program rmp in place for avinza consisting of an appropriate use and communication program  monitoring and surveillance  research and evaluation 
king s risk management team rmt meets every weeks to review data collected on any reported misuse  abuse and diversion of avinza 
it is not possible at this time to determine whether or in what way the consideration of a class wide rems for all long acting opioids will change the elements of king s current risk management program for avinza or how any such changes might affect the marketing or sales of avinza 

table of contents as discussed elsewhere in this report  king has ndas for two long acting opioid products  embeda tm and remoxy  under review by the fda 
both of these applications include comprehensive proposals for rems for those products 
it is not possible at this time to determine what  if any  affect the fda s ongoing process for developing class wide rems for previously approved  currently marketed long acting opioids will have on the fda s review timeline of the pending ndas for embeda tm and or remoxy  or their future market potential 
thrombin jmi beginning in the fourth quarter of  thrombin jmi  our bovine thrombin product  faced new competition 
a human thrombin product entered the market in the fourth quarter of and a recombinant human thrombin entered the market during the first quarter of sonata in june  a third party entered the market with a generic substitute for sonata following the expiration of our patent covering sonata

table of contents the following table summarizes our deductions from gross sales 
for the years ended december  in thousands gross sales commercial rebates medicare part d rebates medicaid rebates chargebacks returns trade discounts other discontinued operations net sales gross sales were lower in compared to primarily due to a decrease in gross sales of altace  partially offset by increases in gross sales of avinza  which we acquired on february   and the meridian auto injector segment 
during december a competitor entered the market with a generic substitute for altace and additional generic competitors entered the market in june we anticipate gross sales will increase in due to the acquisition of alpharma at the end of december  partially offset by anticipated decreases in sales of several key products in the branded prescription pharmaceuticals segment discussed below 
gross sales were higher in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of avinza on february   price increases taken during and an increase in gross sales of our meridian auto injector segment 
these increases in gross sales were partially offset by a decline in prescriptions of certain of our branded prescription pharmaceutical products during we maintain inventory management and data services agreements imas with each of our three key branded prescription wholesale customers and other wholesale customers 
these agreements provide wholesalers incentives to manage inventory levels and provide timely and accurate data with respect to inventory levels held  and valuable data regarding sales and marketplace activity 
we rely on the timeliness and accuracy of the data that each customer provides to us on a regular basis pursuant to these agreements 
if our wholesalers fail to provide us with timely and accurate data in accordance with the agreements  our estimates for certain reserves included in our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
based on inventory data provided by our key customers under the imas  we believe that wholesale inventory levels of skelaxin  thrombin jmi  and avinza  as of december   are at or below levels we consider normal 
as part of the acquisition of alpharma at the end of december  we acquired the flector patch product 
we believe that the wholesale inventory levels of flector patch at the time of the acquisition were well above levels we consider normal 
as a result  we expect that sales of flector patch in the first quarter of will be significantly less than prescription demand 
we estimate that the wholesale and retail inventories of all our products as of december  represent gross sales of approximately million to million 

table of contents the following tables provide the activity and ending balances for our significant deductions from gross sales 
accrual for rebates  including administrative fees in thousands balance at january  net of prepaid amounts current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior periods rebates paid alpharma acquisition balance at december  net of prepaid amounts rebates include commercial rebates and medicaid and medicare rebates 
during the first quarter of  we paid approximately million related to i the settlement agreements with the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services hhs oig and the department of veterans affairs  to resolve the governmental investigations related to our underpayment of rebates owed to medicaid and other governmental pricing programs during the period from to and ii similar state settlement agreements 
of the million paid in the first quarter of  approximately million reduced the rebate accrual and is reflected in rebates paid in the table above 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we delayed our regular periodic medicaid rebate payments as a result of prior overpayments 
during the second quarter of  we began reducing our payments for medicaid rebates to utilize overpayments made to the government related to medicaid during the government pricing investigation in  and during the period of the investigation  we made actual medicaid payments in excess of estimated expense to avoid any underpayments to the government 
during the third quarter of  we began reporting to the centers for medicare and medicaid services using a refined calculation to compute our average manufacturer s price amp and best price 
as a result of refining the amp and best price calculations in the third quarter of  we discontinued the practice of making payments in excess of the amounts expensed 
we expect to recover the remaining overpayments to the government and will continue to reduce cash payments in the future until this overpayment is fully recovered 
in  and  the utilization of overpayments reduced our rebate payments by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the utilization of the overpayment has therefore reduced rebates paid in the table above 
during the third quarter of  we reduced our medicaid rebate expense and increased net sales from branded prescription pharmaceutical products by approximately million due to the determination that a liability established in for a government pricing program for military dependents and retirees was no longer probable 
a competitor entered the market with a generic substitute for altace during december and additional competitors entered the market in june as a result of this competition  sales of altace and utilization of altace by rebate eligible customers decreased in each quarter of and we expect sales of altace to continue to decline significantly in the future 
the significant decrease in utilization of altace by rebate eligible customers has significantly decreased the current provision related to sales made in the current period in the table above 
as altace sales continue to decline  we expect rebate payments to continue to exceed the current provision as shown in the table above 
rebate payments are made to rebate eligible customers approximately one quarter after the utilization 
when altace sales stabilize  we anticipate our rebate payments will more closely approximate our current provision for rebates

we also consider current wholesale and retail inventory levels of our products 
because actual returns related to sales in prior periods were lower than our original estimates  we recorded a decrease in our reserve for returns in each of the first quarter of and the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded prescription pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount 
the effect of the change in estimate on first quarter operating income was an increase of approximately million 
during the first quarter of  we decreased our reserve for returns by approximately million and increased our net sales from branded prescription pharmaceuticals  excluding the adjustment to sales classified as discontinued operations  by the same amount

table of contents cost of revenues cost of revenues from branded prescription pharmaceutical products decreased in from primarily due to lower unit sales of altace and the sale of several of our other branded prescription pharmaceutical products to jhp on october   partially offset by an increase in unit sales of avinza due to the acquisition of this product on february  cost of revenues from branded prescription pharmaceutical products increased in from primarily due to an increase in royalties associated with skelaxin and avinza and the effects of special items in associated with altace as discussed below 
special items are those particular material income or expense items that our management believes are not related to our ongoing  underlying business  are not recurring  or are not generally predictable 
these items include  but are not limited to  restructuring expenses  non capitalized expenses associated with acquisitions  such as in process research and development charges and inventory valuation adjustment charges  charges resulting from the early extinguishments of debt  asset impairment charges  expenses of drug recalls  and gains and losses resulting from the divestiture of assets 
we believe the identification of special items enhances an analysis of our ongoing  underlying business and an analysis of our financial results when comparing those results to that of a previous or subsequent like period 
however  it should be noted that the determination of whether to classify an item as a special item involves judgments by us 
special items affecting cost of revenues from branded prescription pharmaceuticals during  and included the following a charge of million in primarily associated with minimum purchase requirements under a supply agreement to purchase raw materials associated with altace

most of our epipen sales are based on our supply agreement with dey  lp which markets  distributes and sells the product worldwide  except for canada where it is marketed  distributed and sold by us 
revenues from the 
table of contents meridian auto injector segment fluctuate based on the buying patterns of dey  lp and government customers 
revenues from government entities were unusually high in compared to with respect to auto injector products sold to government entities  demand for these products is affected by the timing of procurements which can be affected by preparedness initiatives and responses to domestic and international events 
demand for epipen is seasonal as a result of its use in emergency treatment of allergic reactions for both insect stings or bites  more of which occur in the warmer months  and food allergies  for which demand increases in the months preceding the start of a new school year 
revenues from epipen in the united states increased in from due to an increase in prescriptions 
total prescriptions for epipen in the united states increased approximately in compared to according to ims monthly prescription data 
we do not believe revenues from meridian auto injector segment will continue to increase at the rate experienced in revenues from our meridian auto injector segment increased in compared to primarily due to increases in unit sales of epipen to dey  lp  an increase in revenues derived from our acquisition of the rights to market and sell epipen in canada that we purchased from allerex laboratory ltd 
in march and a price increase taken in the first quarter of cost of revenues from the meridian auto injector segment increased in compared to and in compared to primarily due to higher unit sales 
royalties segment change for the years ended december  in thousands royalty revenue cost of revenues  exclusive of depreciation  amortization and impairments revenues from royalties are derived primarily from payments we receive based on sales of adenoscan 
we are not responsible for the marketing of this product 
as a result  we are not able to predict whether revenue from royalties will increase or decrease in future periods 
on april   cv therapeutics  inc and astellas pharma us  inc 
announced that the fda approved regadenoson injection  an aa adenosine receptor agonist product that will compete with adenoscan 
regadenoson has been commercialized by astellas 
astellas is also responsible for the marketing and sale of adenoscan pursuant to agreements we have with astellas 
it is anticipated that with the commercial launch of regadenoson  sales of adenoscan and our royalty revenue may continue to decline 
however  our agreements with astellas provide for minimum royalty payments to king of million per year for three years beginning june  and ending may  
king will continue to receive royalties on the sale of adenoscan through expiration of the patents covering the product  but the minimum guaranteed portion of the royalty payments terminates upon certain events  including a finding of invalidity or unenforceability of the patents related to adenoscan

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in amortization associated with altace  partially offset by increases in amortization associated with skelaxin and avinza  as discussed below 
in addition  the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense during was partially attributable to the cessation of depreciation and amortization associated with the rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility that we sold in october following the circuit court s decision in september invalidating our patent that covered altace  we undertook an analysis of the potential effect on future net sales of the product 
based upon this analysis  we reduced the estimated remaining useful life of altace 
accordingly  amortization of the remaining intangibles associated with altace was completed during the first quarter of the amortization expense associated with altace during the first quarter of was million 
in january  we entered into an agreement with corepharma providing corepharma with the right to launch an authorized generic version of skelaxin pursuant to a license in december  or earlier under certain conditions 
as a result  we decreased the estimated useful life of skelaxin  which had the effect of increasing amortization in compared to additionally  on february   we completed our acquisition of avinza and began amortizing the associated intangible assets as of that date 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to primarily due to increased amortization expense related to avinza and altace  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense associated with the sale of the rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility

an intangible asset impairment charge of million in related to our altace product as a result of the invalidation of the patent which covered the altace product 
following the circuit court s decision  we reduced the estimated useful life of this product and forecasted net sales 
this decrease in estimated remaining useful life and forecasted net sales reduced the probability weighted estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with altace intangible assets to a level below their carrying value 
we determined the fair value of these assets based on probability weighted estimated discounted future cash flows 
a charge of million in related to the write down of our rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility and certain legacy branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
on october   we closed the asset purchase agreement with jhp  pursuant to which jhp acquired our rochester  michigan sterile manufacturing facility  some of our legacy products that are manufactured there and the related contract manufacturing business

an intangible asset impairment charge in of million  which is primarily related to lower than expected prescription growth for intal and tilade 
these charges were recorded in order to adjust the carrying value of the intangible assets on our balance sheet associated with these products so as to reflect the estimated fair value of these assets at the time the charges were incurred 
restructuring charges in the amount of million in primarily related to our integration of alpharma

petersburg  florida facility to the bristol  tennessee facility 
as of december   the net intangible assets associated with skelaxin and synercid totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
we believe that these intangible assets are not currently impaired based on estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets 
however  if our estimates regarding future cash flows prove to be incorrect or adversely change  we may have to reduce the estimated remaining useful life and or write off a portion or all of these intangible assets 
certain generic companies have challenged patents on skelaxin and avinza 
in addition  on january   the us district court issued an order ruling invalid two of our skelaxin patents 
for additional information  please see note  commitments and contingencies and note  subsequent events in part iv  item a  financial statements 
if a generic version of skelaxin or avinza enters the market  we may have to write off a portion or all of the intangible assets associated with these products

management currently believes that the long term assets associated with these facilities are not impaired based 
table of contents on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
however  if we were to approve a plan to sell or close any of the facilities for which the carrying value exceeds fair market value  we would have to write off a portion of the assets or reduce the estimated useful life of the assets  which would accelerate depreciation 
non operating items for the years ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense loss on investment gain on early extinguishment of debt other  net income tax expense discontinued operations other income expense interest income interest income decreased during compared to primarily due to a decrease in interest rates partially offset by a higher total balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities in interest income increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in interest rates and a higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities in compared to we believe interest income will decrease in compared to due to a reduction in cash  cash equivalents and investments in debt securities

the acquisition was funded with available cash on hand  borrowings of million under the senior secured revolving credit facility  as amended on december   and borrowings of million under a new senior secured term facility 
as a result of these borrowings we expect interest expense to increase significantly in for more information regarding this financing and the associated interest rates  please see the sections entitled senior secured revolving credit facility and senior secured term facility under  certain indebtedness and other matters  below 
additionally  in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion fsp apb 
fsp apb requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will adopt fsp apb as of january  upon adoption of fsp apb  our accounting for our million convertible senior notes due april  will be affected 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of fsp apb on our financial statements  but estimate that implementation would result in a reduction in the carrying value of the outstanding million convertible senior notes due april  by approximately million  with a corresponding increase in equity 
we also estimate that upon adoption  the retrospective application of fsp apb will 
table of contents result in increased interest expense of approximately million for the year ending december  retrospective application to all periods presented is required 
special items affecting other income expense included the following a loss of million in related to our investment in debt securities

income of million during resulting from the early retirement of our convertible debentures due november  income tax expense during  our effective income tax rate on the loss from continuing operations was

during  our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 
this rate differed from the statutory rate of primarily due to tax benefits relating to tax exempt interest income and domestic production activities deductions  which benefits were partially offset by state taxes 
additionally  the rate benefited from the release of reserves under fin as a result of the expiration of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the and tax years

the following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payment due by period less than one to four to more than total one year three years five years five years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations interest on long term debt total our unconditional purchase obligations are primarily related to minimum purchase requirements under contracts with suppliers to purchase raw materials and finished goods related to our branded prescription pharmaceutical products and commitments associated with research and development projects 
the above table 
table of contents does not reflect any potential milestone payments in connection with research and development projects or acquisitions 
required funding obligations for relating to the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material 
we have a supply agreement with a third party to produce metaxalone  the active ingredient in skelaxin 
this supply agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum levels of metaxalone and expires in if sales of skelaxin are not consistent with current forecasts  we could incur losses in connection with purchase commitments for metaxalone  which could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits beyond one year  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement for years beyond cannot be made 
liquidity and capital resources general we believe that existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  investments in debt securities and marketable securities  cash generated from operations and our existing revolving credit facility are sufficient to finance our current operations and working capital requirements on both a short term and long term basis 
however  we cannot predict the amount or timing of our need for additional funds 
we cannot provide assurance that funds will be available to us when needed on favorable terms  or at all 
investments in debt securities as of december   our investments in debt securities consisted solely of tax exempt auction rate securities and did not include any mortgage backed securities or any securities backed by corporate debt obligations 
the tax exempt auction rate securities that we hold are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that are intended to reset through an auction process generally every seven  or days 
our investment policy requires us to maintain an investment portfolio with a high credit quality 
accordingly  our investments in debt securities are limited to issues which were rated aa or higher at the time of purchase 
in the event that we attempt to liquidate a portion of our holdings through an auction and are unable to do so  we term it an auction failure 
on february   we began to experience auction failures 
as of december   all our investments in auction rate securities  with a total par value of million  have experienced multiple failed auctions 
in the event of an auction failure  the interest rate on the security is reset according to the contractual terms in the underlying indenture 
as of february   we have received all scheduled interest payments associated with these securities 
the current instability in the credit markets may continue to affect our ability to liquidate these securities 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
based on the frequency of auction failures and the lack of market activity  current market prices are not available for determining the fair value of these investments 
as a result  we have measured million in par value of our investments in debt securities  or of the assets that we have measured at fair value  using unobservable inputs which are classified as level measurements under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

for additional information regarding sfas no 
 please see note  fair value measurements  in part iv  item a  financial statements 
although we have realized no loss of principal with respect to these investments  as of december   we recorded unrealized losses on our investments in auction rate securities of million 
we have recorded million of the unrealized holding losses in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet  as we believe the decline is temporary and we have the intent and ability to hold our investments in securities until they recover in value or until maturity 
during the fourth quarter of we accepted an offer from ubs financial services  inc ubs providing us the right to sell certain auction rate securities with a par value of million to ubs during the period from june  to july  at par value 
we have elected to account for this right at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the right to sell the auction rate securities 
table of contents to ubs at par was valued at million and has been reflected as an unrealized gain in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we transferred the classification of the auction rate securities that are included in this right from available for sale securities to trading securities and therefore recognized the unrealized losses related to these securities of million in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated operations 
in addition  we have recognized unrealized losses of million in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for a municipal bond for which the holding losses were determined to be other than temporary 
as of december   we had approximately million  in par value  invested in tax exempt auction rate securities which consisted of million associated with student loans backed by the federal family education loan program ffelp  million associated with municipal bonds in which performance is supported by bond insurers and million associated with student loans collateralized by loan pools which equal at least of the bond issue 
as of december   we classified million of auction rate securities as current assets and million as long term assets 
skelaxin as previously disclosed  we are involved in multiple legal proceedings over patents relating to our product skelaxin 
on january   the us district court for the eastern district of new york  in the case of king pharmaceuticals  inc  et al 
v 
eon labs inc  case no 
cv dgt  issued an order ruling invalid two of these patents  united states patent nos 
 and  the order was issued without the benefit of a hearing in response to eon labs motion for summary judgment 
we plan to appeal  upon the entry of an appropriate judgment  and intend to vigorously defend our interests 
the entry of the order may lead to generic versions of skelaxin entering the market sooner than previously anticipated  which would likely cause net sales of skelaxin to decline significantly 
following the decision of the district court  we conducted an extensive examination of the company and developed a restructuring initiative designed to partially offset the potential material decline in skelaxin sales in the event that a generic competitor enters the market 
this initiative includes  based on an analysis of our strategic needs a reduction in sales  marketing and other personnel  leveraging of staff  expense reductions and additional controls over spending  and reorganization of sales teams 
our animal health activities are not affected by the restructuring 
we estimate that  in connection with the restructuring initiative  we will incur total restructuring costs of between million and million  all of which are expected to be incurred and expensed during the first half of and almost all of which will be cash expenditures 
these costs all relate to severance pay and other employee termination expenses

during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a strategic alliance with pain therapeutics  inc to develop and commercialize remoxy and other opioid painkillers 
remoxy  an investigational novel formulation of long acting oxycodone with a proposed indication for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain  provides a unique physical barrier that is designed to provide controlled pain relief and resist certain common methods used to extract the opioid more rapidly than intended  as can occur with currently available products 
common methods used to cause a rapid extraction of the opioid include crushing  chewing  or dissolution in alcohol 
these methods are typically used to cause failure of the controlled release dosage form  resulting in dose dumping of oxycodone  or the immediate release of the active drug 
under the strategic alliance  we made an upfront cash payment of million in december and made a milestone payment of million in july to pain therapeutics 
in august  we made milestone payments totaling million 
in addition  we may pay additional milestone payments of up to million in cash based on the successful clinical and regulatory development of remoxy and other opioid products

alpharma convertible senior notes at the time of the acquisition of alpharma by us  alpharma had million of convertible senior notes outstanding alpharma notes 
the alpharma notes were convertible into shares of alpharma s class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of alpharma common shares per  principal amount 
the conversion rate of the alpharma notes was subject to adjustment upon the direct or indirect sale of all or substantially all of alpharma s assets or more than of the outstanding shares of the alpharma common stock to a third party a fundamental change 
in the event of a fundamental change  the alpharma notes included a make whole provision that adjusted the conversion rate by a predetermined number of additional shares of the alpharma s common stock based on the effective date of the fundamental change  and alpharma s common stock market price as of the effective date 
the acquisition of alpharma by us was a fundamental change 
as a result  any alpharma notes converted in connection with the acquisition of alpharma were entitled to be converted at an increased rate equal to the value of alpharma common shares  at the acquisition price of per share  per  principal amount of alpharma notes at a date no later than trading days after the occurrence of the fundamental change 
as of december   we had million of alpharma notes included in current portion of long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we paid million to redeem the alpharma notes 
impact of inflation we have experienced only moderate raw material and labor price increases in recent years 
in general  the price increases we have passed along to our customers have offset inflationary pressures 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position  and apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
table of contents liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates for which it is reasonably possible that a material change in estimate could occur in the near term include forecasted future cash flows used in testing for impairments of intangible and tangible assets and loss accruals for excess inventory and fixed purchase commitments under our supply contracts 
forecasted future cash flows in particular require considerable judgment and are subject to inherent imprecision 
in the case of impairment testing  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a material impairment charge and  whether they result in an immediate impairment charge  could result prospectively in a reduction in the estimated remaining useful life of tangible or intangible assets  which could be material to the financial statements 
other significant estimates include accruals for medicaid and other rebates  returns and chargebacks  allowances for doubtful accounts and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from the related estimates  and our estimates may change from time to time in response to actual developments and new information 
the significant accounting estimates that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results include the following intangible assets  goodwill  and other long lived assets 
when we acquire product rights in conjunction with either business or asset acquisitions  we allocate an appropriate portion of the purchase price to intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the purchase price is allocated to product rights and trademarks  patents  acquired research and development  if any  and other intangibles using the assistance of valuation consultants 
we estimate the useful lives of the assets by factoring in the characteristics of the products such as patent protection  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  estimated future introductions of competing products  and other issues 
the factors that drive the estimate of the life of the asset are inherently uncertain 
however  patents have specific legal lives over which they are amortized 
conversely  trademarks and product rights have no specific legal lives 
we use a straight line method of amortization for our intangible assets 
we review our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review our goodwill for possible impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in any event  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
this evaluation is performed through our quarterly evaluation of intangibles for impairment 
further  on an annual basis  we review the life of each intangible asset and make adjustments as deemed appropriate 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of our individual business reporting units on a discounted cash flow basis 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and  in some cases  the current fair value of the asset 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
as of december   our goodwill totaled million 
of this amount  million is related to our branded prescription pharmaceuticals segment and includes million associated with our acquisition of alpharma on december  our animal health segment has total goodwill of million which is solely related to our acquisition of alpharma 
additionally  our meridian auto injection segment has total goodwill of million 
revenues associated with meridian auto injector increased in compared to as of december   management believes that no impairment of goodwill exists 
the allocation of the purchase price associated with the acquisition of alpharma is not yet finalized as the acquisition was completed close to the end of the year and management is continuing to complete its initial estimate of the valuation of assets and liabilities 

table of contents we may incur impairment charges in the future if prescriptions for  or sales of  our products are less than current expectations and result in a reduction of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
this may be caused by many factors  including competition from generic substitutes  significant delays in the manufacture or supply of materials  the publication of negative results of studies or clinical trials  new legislation or regulatory proposals 
the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization as of december  are as follows gross carrying accumulated net book amount amortization value in thousands branded prescription pharmaceuticals avinza skelaxin sonata flector patch neuroscience synercid other hospital hospital bicillin other legacy products legacy products total branded animal health meridian auto injector royalties contract manufacturing all other total intangible assets

our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we evaluate our entire inventory for short dated or slow moving product and inventory commitments under supply agreements based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  we estimate their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net realizable value is less than cost  on a product basis  we make a provision to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
we maintain supply agreements with some of our vendors which contain minimum purchase requirements 
we estimate future inventory requirements based on current facts and trends 
should our minimum purchase requirements under supply agreements or if our estimated future inventory requirements exceed actual inventory quantities that we will be able to sell to our customers  we record a charge in costs of revenues 
accruals for rebates  returns and chargebacks 
we establish accruals for returns  chargebacks  medicaid  medicare and commercial rebates in the same period we recognize the related sales 
the 
table of contents accruals reduce revenues and are included in accrued expenses 
at the time a rebate or chargeback payment is made or a product return is received  which occurs with a delay after the related sale  we record a reduction to accrued expenses and  at the end of each quarter  adjust accrued expenses for differences between estimated and actual payments 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of returns  chargebacks and rebates  the actual amount of product returns and claims for chargebacks and rebates may be different from our estimates 
our product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns over the period during which customers have a right of return which is in turn based in part on estimates of the remaining shelf life of our products when sold to customers 
future product returns are estimated primarily on historical sales and return rates 
we also consider the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel 
we base our estimate of our medicaid rebate  medicare rebate and commercial rebate accruals on estimates of usage by rebate eligible customers  estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain potentially subject to those rebates  and the terms of our commercial and regulatory rebate obligations 
we base our estimate of our chargeback accrual on our estimates of the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks  and specific contractual and historical chargeback rates 
the estimate of the level of our products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by our three key wholesalers under inventory management agreements 
our accruals for returns  chargebacks and rebates are adjusted as appropriate for specific known developments that may result in a change in our product returns or our rebate and chargeback obligations 
in the case of product returns  we monitor demand levels for our products and the effects of the introduction of competing products and other factors on this demand 
when we identify decreases in demand for products or experience higher than historical rates of returns caused by unexpected discrete events  we further analyze these products for potential additional supplemental reserves 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers  collection of sales is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
accruals for estimated returns  rebates and chargebacks  determined based on historical experience  reduce revenues at the time of sale and are included in accrued expenses 
medicaid and certain other governmental pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of relevant statutes and regulatory guidance  which are complex and  in certain respects  ambiguous 
moreover  prevailing interpretations of these statutes and guidance can change over time 
royalty revenue is recognized based on a percentage of sales namely  contractually agreed upon royalty rates reported by third parties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in the market values of some of our investments investment risk  the effect of interest rate changes interest rate risk and the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have no financial instruments held for trading purposes 
additionally  at december   and  we held derivative financial instruments associated with utility contracts which qualify as normal purchase and sales and derivatives associated with the convertible senior notes 
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are set forth below 

table of contents interest rate risk the fair market value fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our convertible debentures is affected by our stock price 
the estimated fair value of our total long term fixed rate debt at december  was million  which excludes the alpharma notes which were outstanding at the time of our acquisition of alpharma 
fair values were determined from available market prices  using current interest rates and terms to maturity 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by  the fair value of our long term debt would increase or decrease by approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of alpharma  holders of the alpharma notes were entitled to convert the alpharma notes at a premium as a result of a fundamental change 
as of december   we had million of alpharma notes included in the current portion of long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we paid million to redeem the alpharma notes 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt as changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
as of december   our variable rate debt totaled million and a change in interest rates would have an annualized pre tax effect of million in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows as of december  while our variable rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change  it is not subject to changes in fair value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
we primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiary s functional currency 
such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment 
at december   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts mainly denominated in euros  pound sterling  canadian dollar  us dollar  mexican peso and chinese yuan with a notional amount of million 
the fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material 
all contracts expire in the first quarter of the cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non functional currency transactions 
the change in notional value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable 
such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes 
investment risk we have marketable securities which are carried at fair value based on current market quotes 
gains and losses on securities are based on the specific identification method
