item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations joint ventures and other equity investments for a further discussion 
the company s inability to control entities in which it invests may affect its ability to receive distributions from those entities or to fully implement its business plan 
the incurrence of debt or entry into other agreements by an entity not under its control may result in 
table of contents restrictions or prohibitions on that entity s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions 
even where these entities are not restricted by contract or by law from making distributions  the company may not be able to influence the occurrence or timing of such distributions 
in addition  if any of the other investors in these entities fails to observe its commitments  that entity may not be able to operate according to its business plan or the company may be required to increase its level of commitment 
if any of these events were to occur  its business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
because the company does not own a majority or maintain voting control of these entities  the company does not have the ability to control their policies  management or affairs 
the interests of persons who control these entities or partners may differ from the company s  and they may cause such entities to take actions which are not in its best interest 
if the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its partners in these entities  the company could lose its ability to operate in these areas which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could adversely affect its business 
the company has expanded its business partly through acquisitions and may continue to make selective acquisitions 
the company s acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  obtaining financing on acceptable terms  and its ability to comply with the restrictions contained in its debt agreements 
acquisitions may divert a significant amount of management s time away from the operation of its business 
future acquisitions may also have an adverse effect on its operating results  particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following their completion while the company integrates the operations of the acquired business 
growth by acquisition involves risks that could have a material adverse effect on business and financial results  including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies and the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired companies 
once integrated  acquired operations may not achieve the levels of revenues  profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by its existing operations  or otherwise performs as expected 
while the company has experience in identifying and integrating acquisitions  the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain the capital necessary to pursue its acquisition strategy or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all 
even if the company successfully completes an acquisition  it may not be able to integrate it into its business satisfactorily or at all 
increases of illegal transshipment of textile and apparel goods into the us could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
according to industry experts and trade associations  illegal transshipments of apparel products into the us continue to negatively impact the textile market 
illegal transshipment involves circumventing quotas by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are a product of a particular country of origin or include yarn of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional ftas  such as nafta and cafta 
if illegal transshipment is not monitored and enforcement is not effective  these shipments could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company is subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities or cause interruptions in its operations 
the company is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  the protection of the environment and the use or cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes 
the company may incur substantial costs  including fines  damages and criminal or civil sanctions  or experience interruptions in its operations for actual or alleged violations of or compliance requirements arising under environmental laws  any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s operations could result in violations of environmental laws  including spills or other releases of hazardous substances to the environment 
in the event of a catastrophic incident  the company could incur material costs 
in addition  the company could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws 
for example  on september   the company completed its acquisition of the polyester filament manufacturing assets located at kinston from invista 
the land for the kinston site was leased 
table of contents pursuant to a year ground lease with dupont 
since  dupont has been investigating and cleaning up the kinston site under the supervision of the epa and denr pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act corrective action program 
the corrective action program requires dupont to identify all potential aocs  assess the extent of containment at the identified aocs and clean it up to comply with applicable regulatory standards 
effective march   the company entered into a lease termination agreement associated with conveyance of certain assets at kinston to dupont 
this agreement terminated the ground lease and relieved the company of any future responsibility for environmental remediation  other than participation with dupont  if so called upon  with regard to the company s period of operation of the kinston site 
however  the company continues to own a satellite service facility acquired in the invista transaction that has contamination from dupont s operations and is monitored by denr 
this site has been remediated by dupont and dupont has received authority from denr to discontinue remediation  other than natural attenuation 
dupont s duty to monitor and report to denr with respect to this site will be transferred to the company in the future  at which time dupont must pay the company for seven years of monitoring and reporting costs and the company will assume responsibility for any future remediation and monitoring of the site 
at this time  the company has no basis to determine if and when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the aocs or the extent of any potential liability for the same 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources environmental liabilities 
furthermore  the company may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from its properties or at off site locations where the company disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated the purchase of its businesses 
if significant previously unknown contamination is discovered  existing laws or their enforcement change or its indemnities do not cover the costs of investigation and remediation  then such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows 
health and safety regulation costs could increase 
the company s operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the us occupational safety and health administration and comparable statutes in foreign jurisdictions where the company operates 
the company believes that it employs appropriate precautions to protect its employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at its facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against the company for work related illnesses or injury  and changes in occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the us or in foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates could increase its operating costs 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  the company may become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or be found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceedings  and such costs may be material to the company 
the company s business may be adversely affected by adverse employee relations 
the company employs approximately  employees  approximately  of which are domestic employees and approximately of which are foreign employees 
while employees of its foreign operations are generally unionized  none of its domestic employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the failure to renew collective bargaining agreements with employees of the company s foreign operations and other labor relations issues  including union organizing activities  could result in an increase in costs or lead to a strike  work stoppage or slow down 
such labor issues and unrest by its employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges 
under statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company is required to assess the impairment of the company s long lived assets  such as plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable as measured by the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
when the company determines that the carrying value of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more impairment indicators  the company then measures any impairment based on a projected discounted 
table of contents cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 any such impairment charges will be recorded as operating losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of impairment charges 
in addition  the company evaluates the net values assigned to various equity investments it holds  such as its investment in pal and unf  in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb 
apb requires that a loss in value of an investment  which is other than a temporary decline  should be recognized as an impairment loss 
any such impairment losses will be recorded as operating losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations joint ventures and other equity investments for more information regarding the company s equity investments 
any operating losses resulting from impairment charges under sfas no 
or apb could have an adverse effect on its operating results and therefore the market price of its securities  including its common stock 
the company s business could be adversely affected if the company fails to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trademark  and trade secret laws  licenses  confidentiality and other agreements to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  this protection may not be fully adequate as its intellectual property rights may be challenged or invalidated  an infringement suit by the company against a third party may not be successful and or third parties could design around its technology or adopt trademarks similar to its own 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which its products are manufactured and sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us although the company routinely enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  independent contractors and current and potential strategic and joint venture partners  among others  such agreements may be breached  and the company could be harmed by unauthorized use or disclosure of its confidential information 
further  the company licenses trademarks from third parties  and these agreements may terminate or become subject to litigation 
its failure to protect its intellectual property could materially and adversely affect its competitive position  reduce revenue or otherwise harm its business 
the company may also be accused of infringing or violating the intellectual property rights of third parties 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of its personnel 
should the company be found liable for infringement  the company may be required to enter into licensing arrangements if available on acceptable terms or at all or pay damages and cease selling certain products or using certain product names or technology 
the company s failure to prevail in any intellectual property litigation could materially adversely affect its competitive position  reduce revenue or otherwise harm its business

recent developments and outlook the global economic downturn eroded us consumer confidence which resulted in reduced customer spending which negatively impacted all global textile markets and related supply chains beginning in october us apparel retail sales  home furnishing retail sales  and automotive sales were down approximately  and  respectively  during the last three quarters of fiscal year as compared to the same period for fiscal year the impact of the decline in retail sales was compounded further by excessive inventory levels across the supply chains as fabric mills  finished goods producers  and retailers reduced purchase levels below their current sales levels  in an effort to match their working capital investments with the lower sales volumes that they were experiencing 
as a result of the decreased demand at retail  compounded by this inventory de stocking  the company s revenues declined by  and for the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year as compared to the same prior year quarters  respectively 
however  as the march quarter progressed into the june quarter  the company experienced sales volume improvements in certain segments as retail sales improved slightly and the effects of the de stocking began to subside 
compared to the march quarter  the company s revenues increased in the june quarter primarily due to a combination of improved demand for the company s products and market share gains both domestically and in brazil 
in addition  the company s domestic sales increased approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year due to an unusually high amount of sales related to aged and slow moving inventory 
the company had approximately more sales of aged and slow moving inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal year than its normal quarterly average as a result of a decision to monetize its investment in such aged inventory 
the negative impact on gross profit of these sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal year was approximately million 
like the rest of the supply chain  the company also reacted to the reduced sales volumes by aggressively reducing our investment in working capital 
compared to june  the company reduced net customer 
table of contents receivables by million or and inventories by million or which allowed it to significantly improve its cash position in an otherwise difficult year 
in addition to the difficult economic conditions in the us markets  the company was negatively impacted by the continued rising cost of raw materials and other petrochemical driven costs during the first quarter of fiscal year the impact of the surge in crude oil prices and feedstock supply issues since the beginning of fiscal year created a spike in polyester raw material prices 
as raw material prices peaked in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company was not able to pass all of these raw material increases along to its customers which resulted in lower conversion margins 
operating results for the second and third quarters of fiscal year were also adversely impacted as these higher priced products worked through the company s inventory 
however  crude oil prices declined substantially during the second quarter of fiscal year and certain supply chain issues abated  resulting in a decline in the cost of polyester feedstock 
the benefit of that decline was seen in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year as the company regained conversion margins lost during the run up in the first half of fiscal internationally  the company is committed to identifying growth opportunities to participate in the asian textile market  specifically china 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of its interest in yufi to ycfc and received net proceeds of million 
maintaining a market presence in the asian textile market is important to the company s pva yarn strategy and accordingly the company formed utsc  a wholly owned chinese subsidiary

similar to the us  the adoption timetable for some of these programs may be linked to improvements in the economy  however  the company projects that utsc will operate profitably in the fiscal year which will be a substantial improvement over the results of yufi 
the cafta region continues to be a very important part of the company s global sourcing strategy as us brands and retailers take advantage of the shorter lead times and the competitiveness of the region 
the cafta region s share of synthetic apparel us imports is approximately and is expected to grow over the next several years  making the region a critical component in the apparel supply chain 
to better service customers in the cafta region  the company is exploring options for placing manufacturing capabilities in central america 
at this point  all options are being explored  including joint venture opportunities as well as green field scenarios  and the total investment in the initial stages is expected to be million or less 
the company s brazilian operation had especially strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year  but those results deteriorated through the second and third quarters of fiscal year due to softness in the brazilian economy and supply chain volatility related to raw material costs and the negative impact of currency fluctuations 
the subsidiary s results improved substantially during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as unit sales increased by compared to the third quarter due to the strengthening of the brazilian economy and a gain in market share

see the discussion under the caption review of fiscal year results of operations weeks compared to fiscal weeks included in the company s annual report on form k for fiscal year ended june  income taxes the company has established a valuation allowance to completely offset its us net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to investments 
the company s realization of other deferred tax assets is based on future taxable income within a certain time period and is therefore uncertain 
although the company has reported cumulative losses for both financial and us tax reporting purposes over the last several years  it has determined that deferred tax assets not offset by the valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized primarily based on expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities  particularly those related to property  plant and equipment  the accumulated depreciation for which is expected to reverse approximately million through fiscal year actual future taxable income may vary significantly from management s projections due to the many complex judgments and significant estimations involved  which may result in adjustments to the valuation allowance which may impact the net deferred tax liability and provision for income taxes 
the valuation allowance decreased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to an increase of approximately million in fiscal year the net decrease in fiscal year resulted primarily from a reduction in federal net operating loss carryforwards and the expiration of state income tax credit carryforwards

the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will depend upon its ability to generate cash in the future which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond its control 
the company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to the company under its amended credit agreement in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its debt or to fund its other liquidity needs 
if its future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay its obligations as they mature or to fund its liquidity needs  the company may be forced to reduce or delay its business activities and capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity 
the company may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of its existing and future indebtedness  including the notes and its amended credit agreement  may limit its ability to pursue any of these alternatives 
see item a risk factors the company will require a significant amount of cash to service its indebtedness  and its ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control

recent accounting pronouncements in june  financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
the fasb accounting standards codification tm and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement for sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this statement establishes a single source of generally accepted accounting principles gaap called the codification and is to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
all guidance contained in the codification carries an equal level of authority  however there are standards that will remain authoritative until such time that each is integrated into the codification 
the sec also issues rules and interpretive releases that are also sources of authoritative gaap for publicly traded registrants 
this statement shall be effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur between the balance sheet and the financial statements issue date 
this statement is effective for all interim and annual periods ending after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on december   the company adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 requiring enhancements to the disclosure requirements for derivative and hedging activities 
the objective of the enhanced disclosure requirement is to provide the user of financial statements with a clearer understanding of how the entity uses derivative instruments  how derivatives are accounted for  and how derivatives affect an entity s financial position  cash flows and performance 
the statement applies to all derivative and hedging instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the adoption of sfas no 
did not materially change the company s disclosures of derivative and hedging instruments 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
addresses how companies should measure fair value when companies are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap 
as a result of sfas no 
 there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the fasb believes that the new standard will make the measurement of fair value more 
table of contents consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
the provisions of sfas no 
were to be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially deferred the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for fiscal year  the company adopted sfas no 
except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations revised 
this new standard replaces sfas no 
business combinations 
sfas no 
r requires that the acquisition method of accounting  instead of the purchase method  be applied to all business combinations and that an acquirer is identified in the process 
the statement requires that fair market value be used to recognize assets and assumed liabilities instead of the cost allocation method where the costs of an acquisition are allocated to individual assets based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill would be calculated as the excess purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired  however  negative goodwill will be recognized immediately as a gain instead of being allocated to individual assets acquired 
costs of the acquisition will be recognized separately from the business combination 
the end result is that the statement improves the comparability  relevance and completeness of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations which occur in fiscal years beginning on or after december  off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those involving accounting estimates that require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time and where different reasonable estimates or changes in the accounting estimate from quarter to quarter could materially impact the presentation of the financial statements 
the following discussion provides further information about accounting policies critical to the company and should be read in conjunction with footnote significant accounting policies and financial statement information of its audited historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for losses is provided for known and potential losses arising from yarn quality claims and for amounts owed by customers 
reserves for yarn quality claims are based on historical claim experience and known pending claims 
the collectability of accounts receivable is based on a combination of factors including the aging of accounts receivable  historical write off experience  present economic conditions such as customer bankruptcy filings within the industry and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
since losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions  and the health of the textile industry  a significant level of judgment is required to arrive at the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts are written off when they are no longer deemed to be collectible 
the reserve for bad debts is established based on certain percentages applied to accounts receivable aged for certain periods of time and are supplemented by specific reserves for certain customer accounts where collection is no longer certain 
the company s exposure to losses as of june  on accounts receivable was million against which an allowance for losses and claims of million was provided 
the company s exposure to losses as of june  on accounts receivable was million against which an allowance for losses of million was provided 
establishing reserves for yarn claims and bad debts requires management judgment and estimates  which may impact the ending accounts receivable valuation  gross margins for yarn claims and the provision for bad debts 
the company does not believe 
table of contents there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions it uses to assess allowance for losses 
certain unforeseen events  which the company considers to be remote  such as a customer bankruptcy filing  could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its accounts receivable loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged accounts receivable reserve percentages would not be material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
inventory reserves 
inventory reserves are established based on percentage markdowns applied to inventories aged for certain time periods 
specific reserves are established based on a determination of the obsolescence of the inventory and whether the inventory value exceeds amounts to be recovered through expected sales prices  less selling costs 
estimating sales prices  establishing markdown percentages and evaluating the condition of the inventories require judgments and estimates  which may impact the ending inventory valuation and gross margins 
the company uses current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of its markdown percentages and expected sales prices 
the company believes it is unlikely that differences in actual demand or selling prices from those projected by management would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years 
a plus or minus change in its aged inventory markdown percentages would not be material to the company s financial statements for the past three years 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held and used  an impairment may occur if projected undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets 
in such cases  additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount of loss to be recognized 
the impairment loss is determined by the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the fair value measured by future discounted cash flows 
the analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and  where applicable  judgments associated with  among other factors  the appropriate discount rate 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of circumstances that indicate the potential impairment of an asset s carrying value is based on several factors including  but not limited to  a decline in operating cash flows or a decision to close a manufacturing facility 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events and general economic conditions  therefore  the company s accounting estimates may change from period to period 
these factors could cause the company to conclude that a potential impairment exists and the related impairment tests could result in a write down of the long lived assets 
to the extent the forecasted operating results of the long lived assets are achieved and the company maintains its assets in good condition  the company believes that it is unlikely that future assessments of recoverability would result in impairment charges that are material to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company reviewed its long lived assets for recoverability during fiscal year and determined that the projected undiscounted cash flows were adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used to perform impairment testing during the past three fiscal years 
a decline in the company s forecasted cash flows would not have resulted in a failure of the fas undiscounted cash flow test 
for assets held for sale  an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value less costs to sell 
estimates are required to determine the fair value  the disposal costs and the time period to dispose of the assets 
such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary 
actual cash flows received or paid could differ from those used in estimating the impairment loss  which would impact the impairment charge ultimately recognized and the company s cash flows 
the company engages independent appraisers in the determination of the fair value of any significant assets held for sale 
the company s estimates have been materially accurate in the past  and accordingly  at this time  management expects to continue to utilize the present estimation processes 
in fiscal years and  the company performed impairment testing which resulted in the write down of polyester and nylon plant  machinery and equipment of million and million  respectively 

table of contents goodwill impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate  operating results  planned investments in the reporting unit  or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  among other factors 
the impairment test requires the company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis 
in step two of the analysis  the company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 
based on a decline in its market capitalization during the third quarter of fiscal year and difficult market conditions  the company determined that it was appropriate to re evaluate the carrying value of its goodwill during the quarter ended march  in connection with this third quarter interim impairment analysis  the company updated its cash flow forecasts based upon the latest market intelligence  its discount rate and its market capitalization values 
the projected cash flows are based on the company s forecasts of volume  with consideration of relevant industry and macroeconomic trends 
the fair value of the domestic polyester reporting unit was determined based upon a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach utilizing market multiples of guideline publicly traded companies 
as a result of the findings  the company determined that the goodwill was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal year impairment of joint venture investments 
apb states that the inability of the equity investee to sustain sufficient earnings to justify its carrying value on an other than temporary basis should be assessed for impairment purposes 
the company evaluates its equity investments at least annually to determine whether there is evidence that an investment has been permanently impaired 
as of june   the company had completed its evaluations of its equity investees and determined that its investment in pal was impaired 
the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year based on an appraised fair value of pal  less for lack of marketability and its minority ownership percentage 
the company used an income approach to estimate the fair value of its investment in pal 
this approach utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to determine the fair value 
the analysis required estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and judgments associated with other factors including the appropriate discount rate and the discount reflecting the lack of marketability of the company s minority interest in pal 
although the fair value used in the pal analysis represented what the company believed to be the most probable economic outcome  it was subject to the assumptions and estimates discussed above 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used to perform impairment testing during the past three fiscal years 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate used in the june valuation would have resulted in changes in the fair value of the company s investment in pal of million and million  respectively 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company determined that a review of the carrying value of its investment in ustf was necessary as a result of sales negotiations 
as a result of this review  the company determined that the carrying value exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  a non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year in july  the company announced a proposed agreement to sell its ownership interest in yufi to its partner  ycfc  for million  pending final negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and the receipt of chinese regulatory approvals 
in connection with a review of the yufi value during negotiations related to the sale  the company initiated a review of the carrying value of its investment in yufi in accordance with apb as a result of this review  the company determined that the carrying value of its investment in yufi exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company does not anticipate that the impairment charge will result in any future cash expenditures 
in december  the company re negotiated the proposed agreement to sell its interest in yufi to ycfc for million and recorded an additional impairment charge of million  which included approximately 
table of contents million related to certain disputed accounts receivable and million related to the fair value of its investment  as determined by the re negotiated equity interest sales price  was lower than carrying value 
on march   the company closed on the sale and received million in proceeds related to its investment in yufi 
the company continues to service customers in asia through utsc  a wholly owned subsidiary based in suzhou  china  that is dedicated to the development  sales and service of pva yarns 
utsc is located in the gold river center room  no 
shishan road  suzhou new district  suzhou  which is in jiangsu province 
accruals for costs related to severance of employees and related health care costs 
from time to time  the company establishes accruals associated with employee severance or other cost reduction initiatives 
such accruals require that estimates be made about the future payout of various costs  including  for example  health care claims 
the company uses historical claims data and other available information about expected future health care costs to estimate its projected liability 
such costs are subject to change due to a number of factors  including the incidence rate for health care claims  prevailing health care costs and the nature of the claims submitted  among others 
consequently  actual expenses could differ from those expected at the time the provision was estimated  which may impact the valuation of accrued liabilities and results of operations 
the company s estimates have been materially accurate in the past  and accordingly  at this time management expects to continue to utilize the present estimation processes 
a plus or minus change in its estimated claims assumption would not be material to the company s financial statements 
the company has not made any material changes to the methodology used in establishing its severance and related health care cost accruals during the past three fiscal years 
management and the company s audit committee discussed the development  selection and disclosure of all of the critical accounting estimates described above
