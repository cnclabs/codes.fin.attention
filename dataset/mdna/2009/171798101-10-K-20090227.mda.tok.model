item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
certain amounts in prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation 
this discussion also includes forward looking statements 
please refer to cautionary information about forward looking statements in part i of this form k for important information about these types of statements 
overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations entirely located in the united states 
we have determined that our business is comprised of only one segment because our gathering  processing and marketing activities are ancillary to our production operations and are not separately managed 
we seek to achieve profitable growth in proved reserves and production primarily through exploration and development 
we generally fund our growth with cash flow provided by our operating activities 
to achieve a consistent rate of growth and mitigate risk  we have historically maintained a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk exploration and development projects 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
our oil and gas reserves and operations are mainly located in texas  oklahoma  new mexico  kansas  louisiana and wyoming 
to supplement our growth and to provide for new drilling opportunities  we also consider mergers and acquisitions 
in we acquired magnum hunter resources  inc  in a stock for stock merger with a total transaction value of approximately billion 
magnum hunter was a dallas based independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations concentrated in the permian basin of west texas 
table of contents and new mexico and in the gulf of mexico 
during we purchased million of assets  with the largest acquisition being in the texas panhandle area 
in october we acquired  net acres in our western oklahoma  anadarko basin woodford shale play  at a total cost of million 
we have increased our position in the play to approximately  net acres 
from time to time we also consider selling certain assets 
in  we sold million of non core properties 
the two largest sales were million for our west texas spraberry oil properties and million for our gulf of mexico main pass area operated properties 
during  we sold bcfe of proved reserves for million 
market conditions during the fourth quarter of  severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity caused significant decreases in oil and gas prices 
the dramatic decrease in prices had a significant adverse impact on the amount of cash flow available to invest in exploration and development drilling  the present value of our proved reserves  our stock price and market capitalization 
the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have further impact on our business and our financial position if conditions in the financial markets do not improve 
our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
further  the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
as a result of lower commodity prices we have sharply reduced our drilling activity 
our exploration and development capital investment is expected to decrease from billion in to million in  depending on prices and corresponding cash flow 
summary during we accomplished the following positive operating and financial highlights oil and gas sales increased percent to a record billion 
cash flow from operating activities increased percent to an all time high of  million 
production averaged mmcfe per day in  increasing throughout the year to a fourth quarter peak of mmcfe per day 
added bcfe of proved reserves from extensions  discoveries and improved recovery  replacing percent of production 
increased our western oklahoma  anadarko woodford position to  net acres  including a million purchase of  net acres 
ended the year with a debt to total capitalization ratio of percent 
however  largely as a result of the collapse in oil and gas prices we also experienced the following negative consequences billion after tax  non cash full cost ceiling test write down of oil and gas properties 
negative price related revisions to proved reserves of bcfe  resulting in an overall decrease in our proved reserves to tcfe 
oil and gas prices while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in prices have had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
our annual average realized gas price increased from 
table of contents per mcf in to per mcf in  and oil prices increased from per barrel in to per barrel in strong global demand and overall tight commodity market conditions for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids for the first nine months of resulted in overall higher average realized prices in compared to during the fourth quarter of  reductions in global economic activity and energy demands caused significant decreases in oil and gas prices 
year end oil and gas prices fell from their mid year peak 
our overall average fourth quarter equivalent price realization was approximately below our average third quarter equivalent price 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  economic and geo political factors that we can neither control nor predict 
however  we made limited use of hedging transactions during and to somewhat reduce price risk as discussed further below 
years ended december  gas prices average henry hub price mcf average realized sales price mcf effect of hedges mcf oil prices average wti cushing price bbl average realized sales price bbl on an energy equivalent basis  of our aggregate production was natural gas 
a per mcf change in our average realized gas sales price would have resulted in approximately a million change in our gas revenues 
similarly  of our production was crude oil 
a per barrel change in our average realized crude oil sales price would have resulted in approximately an million change in our oil revenues 
in july we entered into certain derivative contracts covering approximately of our overall gas production and of our gas volumes 
we executed cash flow effective hedges by purchasing mmbtu put options on a portion of our and mid continent gas production 
we used the proceeds from selling call options on the same volume of gas to pay for the puts  thus establishing what is commonly known as a zero cost collar 
we hedged million mmbtu and million mmbtu for and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
reserve replacement and growth because oil and gas are non renewable forms of energy resources  exploration and production companies face the challenge of resource depletion and natural production decline 
our operations also entail significant complexities that require the use of advanced technologies and highly trained personnel 
even when modern exploration technology is properly used  the interpreter still may not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present  the rate at which they will be produced  or economic viability 
future growth will continue to depend upon our ability to economically add reserves in excess of production 
year end total proved oil and gas reserves decreased by from tcfe to tcfe 
this decrease includes production of bcfe  property sales of bcfe and negative price related revisions of bcfe 
proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end natural gas comprised and of our total proved reserves at year end and  respectively 
our proved oil reserves at year end were mmbbls compared to mmbbls at the end of overall  about of our proved reserves are in our mid continent region and are in 
table of contents the permian basin 
our onshore gulf coast and other onshore operations collectively make another of total proved reserves 
only of our total proved reserves are in the gulf of mexico 
the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
for  negative revisions resulting from lower oil and gas prices and higher lease operating expenses decreased proved reserves by on december  see note  supplemental oil and gas disclosures for more reserve information 
in most years our primary source for reserve replacement and growth is exploration and development e d 
we invested  million on e d during and million in approximately of expenditures were in the mid continent area  in the permian basin  in the gulf coast area  and in western other 
cash flow from operating activities for totaled  million  which largely funded our drilling program 
as a result of expected lower commodity prices and corresponding cash flow we project that exploration and development expenditures will range from million to million 
production and other operating expenses the costs associated with finding and producing oil and gas are substantial 
some of these costs vary with oil and gas prices  some trend with production volume and some are a function of the number of wells we own 
at the end of  we owned interests in  wells 
production expense generally consists of the cost of power and fuel  direct labor  third party field services  compression  water disposal  and certain maintenance activity necessary to produce oil and gas from existing wells 
transportation expense is comprised of costs paid to move oil and gas from the wellhead to a specified sales point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion expense  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion expense 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities and estimates of future development costs or reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices and not directly associated with exploration  development or production activities 
while we expect these costs to increase with our growth  we also expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 

table of contents production taxes are assessed by state and local taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem and excise taxes 
significant expenses that generally do not trend with production stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and the expensing of stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
net stock compensation expense in was million compared to million in the derivative fair value gain loss is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and fluctuates based on changes in the fair value of underlying commodities 
as of december  all contracts associated with derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment had settled 
the net derivative fair value gain was million in results of operations compared to we recognized a net loss for of million or per share 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share for the same period in the decrease in net income is primarily the result of a non cash full cost ceiling write down recorded in the third and fourth quarters of the full cost ceiling impairment is discussed further in the operating costs and expenses section below

compared to  our oil production increased by to an average of  barrels per day in this increase resulted in million of incremental revenues 
gas volumes averaged mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in  resulting in an increase in revenues of million 
total oil and gas production volumes were mmcfe per day  up mmcfe per day from both our gas and oil volumes increased as unfolded 
during the fourth quarter of  our gas production averaged mmcf per day up from mmcf per day a three percent increase in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter oil production increased by to  barrels per day  up from  barrels per day in 
table of contents average realized gas prices increased by to per mcf in  compared to per mcf for this price increase boosted gas sales by million between the two periods 
included in our realized gas price is million of cash receipts a positive per mcf effect from settlement of cash flow hedges on  mmbtu per day of mid continent gas production 
realized oil prices averaged per barrel during  compared to per barrel in the increase in oil sales resulting from this improvement in oil prices totaled million 
changes in realized gas and oil prices were mostly the result of overall market conditions and our modest gas hedging program 
for the years ended december  gas gathering  processing and marketing in thousands gas gathering  processing and other revenues gas gathering and processing costs gas gathering and processing margin gas marketing revenues  net of related costs we sometimes transport  process and market third party gas that is associated with our gas 
in  third party gas gathering and processing contributed million of pre tax cash operating margin revenues less direct cash expenses versus million in our gas marketing margin revenues less purchases decreased to million in from million in changes in net margins from gas gathering  processing and marketing activities are the direct result of changes in volumes and overall market conditions 
for the years ended december  variance between operating costs and expenses in thousands impairment of oil and gas properties depreciation  depletion and amortization asset retirement obligation production transportation taxes other than income general and administrative stock compensation other operating  net total operating costs and expenses not including gas gathering  marketing and processing costs  or income tax expense increased to  million in compared to million in the largest component of the increase between periods is the non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of billion billion  net of tax that was recorded as a result of declines in natural gas and oil prices during the last half of at september   our ceiling limitation calculation resulted in excess capitalized costs of million million  net of tax  for which we recorded a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties 
as a result of further declines in natural gas and oil prices during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional non cash impairment of oil and gas properties 
electing to use period end prices  at december   our ceiling limitation calculation 
table of contents resulted in excess capitalized costs of billion billion after tax 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and because the ceiling calculation requires that prices in effect as of the last day of the period be held constant in valuing proved reserves  we may be required to record a ceiling test write down in future periods 
the full cost method of accounting is discussed in detail under critical accounting policies and estimates 
dd a increased million between periods from million in to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for the increase stems from replacement costs for reserves added being higher than costs of reserves produced 
service costs to drill and complete wells have been increasing and we are drilling deeper and more complex wells 
additionally  the significant decrease in oil and gas prices over the last half of reduced the amount of our estimated reserve quantities future production  causing an increase in our depletion rate 
due to the reduction to the carrying value of oil and gas properties recorded at year end we expect the dd a rate to be lower in the first quarter of in comparison to the full year production costs rose million  or nine percent  from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase resulted from an eight percent increase in production volumes and a million increase in workover expense between periods 
transportation costs increased from million in to million in the increase is the result of higher sales volumes  increased market rates and a higher fuel cost component due to higher natural gas prices during the year 
taxes other than income were million greater  rising from million in to million in the increase between periods resulted from increases in oil and gas sales stemming from higher production volumes and commodity prices 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease between periods is due to lower employee benefit costs due to a decrease in bonus and profit sharing expenses resulting from significant decreases in commodity prices during the last quarter of in  the increase in other operating  net to million from million was primarily related to the tulsa county district court issuing a judgment in the hb krug case 
the total accrued litigation expense for the year ended december  for this lawsuit is million 
we have appealed the district court s judgments 
for further information on this lawsuit and other litigation please see contingencies under critical accounting policies and estimates 
other income and expense interest expense decreased by million  or  primarily because of a decrease in our average bank debt outstanding during the year 
in addition  in comparison to prior year  we experienced a decrease in our average interest rate on both our bank borrowings and convertible notes 
capitalized interest increased by million mainly because we had more costs incurred to develop our unproved properties than we had in we also had a gain on the repurchase of convertible notes of million compared to a million gain in on the early extinguishment of debt arising from redemption of our million face value of senior unsecured notes 
other  net decreased from million of income in to million of income in components consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including income and loss in equity investees  gain or loss on sale of inventory  impairments and interest income 
included in our other  net is million of impairment expense on our equity investments and million of impairment on our short term investments 
these additional expenses were offset by a million increase in gain on sale of inventory in comparison to another element of the decrease between periods is lower income of million from equity investees 

table of contents income tax during  a net deferred income tax benefit of million was recognized the year end deferred tax benefit included million of income tax expense 
this compares with current taxes of million and deferred income tax expense of million 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were and in the years of and  respectively 
the effective tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate due to effects of the domestic production activities deduction and percentage depletion 
results of operations compared to net income for was million  or per diluted share 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share in the small change in year over year net income is generally the result of higher oil and gas sales being offset by higher costs and expenses

compared to  our oil production increased by to an average of  barrels per day in this increase resulted in million of incremental revenues 
gas volumes averaged mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in  resulting in a decrease in revenues of million 
total oil and gas production volumes were mmcfe per day  up mmcfe per day from both our gas and oil volumes increased as unfolded 
during the fourth quarter of  our gas production averaged mmcf per day up from mmcf per day a increase in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter oil production increased by to  barrels per day  up from  barrels per day in average realized gas prices increased by to per mcf in  compared to per mcf for this price increase boosted gas sales by million between the two periods 
included in our realized gas price is million of cash receipts a positive per mcf effect from settlement of cash flow hedges on  mmbtu per day of mid continent gas production 
we currently have  mmbtu per day of our mid continent gas production hedged for at a floor price of mmbtu 

table of contents realized oil prices averaged per barrel during  compared to per barrel in the increase in oil sales resulting from this improvement in oil prices totaled million 
changes in realized gas and oil prices were mostly the result of overall market conditions and our modest gas hedging program 
we did not have any cash flow effective hedges in place for volumes 
for the years ended december  gas gathering  processing and marketing in thousands gas gathering and processing revenues gas gathering and processing costs gas gathering and processing margin gas marketing revenues  net of related costs we sometimes transport  process and market third party gas that is associated with our gas 
in  third party gas gathering and processing contributed million of pre tax cash operating margin revenues less direct cash expenses versus million in our gas marketing margin revenues less purchases increased to million in from million in increases in net margins from gas gathering  processing and marketing activities are the direct result of increased volumes and overall market conditions 
for the years ended december  variance between operating costs and expenses in thousands depreciation  depletion and amortization asset retirement obligation production transportation taxes other than income general and administrative stock compensation other operating  net gain on derivative instruments total operating costs and expenses not including gas gathering  marketing and processing costs  or income tax expense increased to million in compared to million in dd a was the largest component of the increase between periods 
dd a totaled million in compared to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for the increase stems from replacement costs for reserves added being higher than costs of reserves produced 
service costs to drill and complete wells have been increasing and we are drilling deeper and more complex wells 
production costs rose million from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in we have experienced higher direct labor cost  higher third party field service costs  increased electricity rates and greater water disposal costs 
transportation costs increased from million in to million in the increase is the result of higher sales volumes and that expiring contracts are being renewed with increased current market rates 

table of contents general and administrative g a expenses increased million from million in to million in the increase between periods is due to an expansion of staff  higher average salaries  higher employee benefit costs  and increased legal representation costs 
in  the increase in other operating  net to million from million was primarily related to resolution of and accruals related to title and royalty issues 
another component of change in total operating costs and expenses between and stems from the million derivative fair value gain we recognized in this gain was associated with price risk management contracts that were not designated for hedge accounting 
these contracts all expired on december  other income and expense interest expense increased by million  or  primarily because of a increase in our total debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 
capitalized interest decreased by million mainly because we are carrying less value associated with unproved properties than we were in we also had a gain in on the early extinguishment of debt arising from redemption of our million face value of old senior unsecured notes 
we replaced the old notes with new ten year  senior unsecured notes 
other  net decreased from million of income in to million of income in components consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including income and loss in equity investees  gain or loss on sale of inventory and interest income 
the decrease from to is due primarily to the liquidation of the company s investment in the company s limited partnership affiliates  teal hunter lp and mallard hunter lp excess distributions of million from this liquidation were recorded during in  we received an additional distribution from this liquidation in the amount of million 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for versus million for the combined federal and state effective income tax rate was and in and  respectively 
included in the income tax expense of million was a current tax expense of million 
liquidity and capital resources overview the world s economy is being driven by the economic downturn and continuing credit crisis 
these constraints  in turn  have pulled down energy prices because of slowing demand 
if the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility or prices continue to decline  and the availability of funds remains limited  we  and third parties with whom we do business  will continue to be negatively impacted 
this could lead to losses associated with uncollectible receivables as well as affect our ability to advance our strategic plans as currently anticipated 
to adapt to current conditions and to prepare for an eventual economic upswing  we have focused on maintaining liquidity  promoting operational efficiency  and expanding long term reserves through focused drilling projects and potential acquisitions 
historically our exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow provided by operating activities operating cash flow 
with the intent to continue to operate within our operating cash flows  we have significantly scaled back our planned drilling program  focusing on our highest rate of return projects which are primarily in our woodford shale position in the anadarko basin of western oklahoma and our south texas yegua and cook mountain play 
with this reduced capital program  we believe that our operating cash flow and other capital resources will be adequate to fund our planned capital expenditures 

table of contents because our exploration program has been reduced  we may not be able to replace the reserves in sources and uses of cash our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flow from operating activities  occasional property sales  borrowings under our bank credit facility and public offerings of debt securities 
our primary uses of funds are exploration and development  property acquisitions  common stock dividends and occasional share repurchases 
the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents from to the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis  these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this document

the increase from to resulted primarily from higher gas prices  high oil prices and increased oil production 
cash flow used in investing activities for was billion  compared to million for and billion for changes in the cash flow used in investing activities are generally the result of changes in our exploration and development programs  acquisitions and property sales 
the increase from to was mostly caused by increased oil and gas expenditures resulting from a more active drilling 
table of contents program 
in addition  we had million less proceeds from sales of assets in when compared to the decrease from to was mostly caused by increased proceeds from property sales 
we sold million of oil and gas properties in versus million in net cash flow provided from financing activities in was million versus million used in in we had borrowings under our credit facility of million and million in proceeds from issuance of common stock and other 
we used million of the borrowings under our credit facility to repurchase a portion of our convertible notes in december and we made million in dividend payments during the year 
net cash flow used in financing activities in was million versus million provided in two significant uses were for share repurchases of million and million for dividends 
proceeds from our may issuance of million of ten year  senior unsecured notes were used to redeem our old notes and reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
capital expenditures the following table sets forth certain historical information regarding capitalized expenditures by us in our oil and gas acquisition  exploration  and development activities in thousands for years ended december  acquisitions proved unproved exploration and development land seismic exploration development property sales property acquisitions primarily relate to various producing properties and exploratory nonproducing leases that we purchased in october 
this million acquisition expanded our woodford shale position in the anadarko basin of western oklahoma by  net acres 
we make significant expenditures to find  acquire  and develop oil and natural gas reserves 
our exploration and development expenditures increased in compared to the increase in resulted primarily from increases in exploration activity in our mid continent and permian regions 
we have reduced our planned capital program for to approximately million due to the expectation of continued low oil and gas prices 
if these prices drop even further  or if operating difficulties are encountered that result in cash flow from operations being less than expected  we may have to reduce our capital expenditures even more 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with environmental and safety regulations and requirements 
these costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations  nor are we aware of any pending regulatory changes that would have a material impact 

table of contents our exploration and development drilling program is discussed in exploration and development activity overview under item of this form k 
financial condition future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells and prices of oil and natural gas 
to meet our capital and liquidity requirements  we rely on certain resources  including cash flows from operating activities  access to capital markets  and bank borrowings 
while we attempt to operate within forecasted cash flows from operations  we do periodically access our credit facility to finance our working capital needs and growth 
recent adverse developments in financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive to access the short term capital market to meet our liquidity needs 
due to the tightened credit markets and significantly lower commodity prices we have planned to scale back our capital program by approximately in comparison to with these planned reductions and amounts available to us under our existing credit facility we believe we will be able to continue to meet our needs for working capital  construction expenditures  debt servicing and dividend payments 
during the year our total assets  net oil and gas assets  net income and stockholders equity were reduced by a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of billion billion after tax 
total assets decreased by billion in from billion at the beginning of the year to billion by year end 
our net oil and gas assets decreased by billion 
our cash position decreased by million primarily as a result of our woodford shale acquisition in october and a decrease in commodity prices during the fourth quarter 
as of december   stockholders equity totaled billion  down from billion at december  the decrease resulted primarily from a net loss of million 
dividends in december  the board of directors declared the company s first quarterly cash dividend of 
per share payable to shareholders 
a dividend has been authorized in every quarter since then 
on december  the board of directors increased the regular cash dividend on our common stock from to per common share 
common stock repurchase program in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to four million shares of common stock 
during we repurchased a total of  shares at an average purchase price of 
cumulative purchases through december  total  shares at an average price of 
no purchases were made in working capital working capital decreased million from year end to million at year end working capital decreased primarily because of the following our cash position decreased by million compared to year end primarily as a result of our woodford shale acquisition in october and a decrease in commodity prices during the fourth quarter 
oil and gas receivables decreased by million due to a significant decrease in commodity prices from the prior year 
trade payables increased by million due to timing of payments 

table of contents these working capital decreases were mostly offset by revenue payable decreased by million due to a significant decrease in commodity prices from the prior year 
inventories increased by million due to increased steel prices and a planned increase in the amount of pipe inventory in our yards 
our receivables are a major component of our working capital and are made up of a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
the collection of receivables during the period presented has been timely 
historically  losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant 
financing debt at december  and consisted of the following in thousands bank debt notes due floating rate convertible notes due face value  and  respectively total long term debt fair market value at june  was million 
the subsequent noted balances represent the fair market value at date of acquisition less amortization of the premium of fair market value over face value 
bank debt we have a billion senior secured revolving credit facility credit facility with a syndicate of banks that had a borrowing base of billion as of december  at our option we set the banks lending commitment under the credit facility at million 
the borrowing base is determined at the discretion of the lenders  based on the collateral value of our proved reserves and is subject to potential special and regular semi annual redeterminations 
the credit facility matures on july  and is secured by mortgages on certain oil and gas properties and the stock of certain wholly owned operating subsidiaries 
amounts outstanding bear interest at our election at either a floating london interbank offered rate libor plus or at the jp morgan chase bank prime rate plus 
at december   there was million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
we also had letters of credit outstanding of million leaving an unused borrowing availability of million at december  the credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio current assets to current liabilities  as defined greater than to and a leverage ratio indebtedness to ebitda  as defined not to exceed to the current ratio  as defined by the credit agreement  at december   was to and our leverage ratio was to as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and non financial covenants 
we have initiated discussions with our syndicate of banks regarding a new three year senior secured revolving credit facility with the intent to increase the banks lending commitment from million to million 
in addition  we may consider a high yield bond offering in the future  if appropriate 

table of contents notes due in may   we issued million of senior unsecured notes that mature may  at par

we repurchased the million in notes with borrowings under our credit facility 
the remaining notes have future repurchase dates as of december   and we have the right at any time to redeem some or all of the notes still outstanding at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
in addition to the repurchase rights  holders of the convertible notes may surrender their notes for conversion into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain circumstances  including if the price of our common stock has been trading above the conversion price of per share 
on december   the closing price of our common stock traded on the new york stock exchange was 
if a specified change of control occurs  subject to certain conditions  we must make an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase 

table of contents contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt fixed rate interest payments operating leases drilling commitments inventory commitments gas processing facility asset retirement obligation other liabilities these amounts do not include interest on the million of bank debt outstanding at december  the weighted average interest rate at december  was approximately 
see item a interest rate risk for more information regarding fixed and variable rate debt 
we have drilling commitments of approximately million consisting of obligations to complete drilling wells in progress at december  we also have minimum expenditure commitments of million to secure the use of drilling rigs 
hurricanes gustav and ike occurred during the third quarter of we are continuing to evaluate damages to our wells and platforms 
it is not presently determinable what our share of the total damages will be after insurance proceeds 
at december   we had outstanding purchase order commitments of million for tubular inventory 
subsequent to year end we have been able to cancel approximately million of those commitments  and efforts continue to further reduce our inventory commitments 
we have a large development project in sublette county  wyoming where we are developing the deep madison gas formation and constructing a gas processing plant 
at december   we had commitments of million relating to construction of the gas processing plant of which million is subject to a construction contract 
the total cost of the project will approximate million 
pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement with our partners in this project  we will be reimbursed by them for of the costs 
we have excluded the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
other liabilities include the fair value of our liabilities associated with our benefit obligations and other miscellaneous commitments 
at december   we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately bcf of natural gas over the next twelve months 
if this gas is not delivered  our financial commitment would be approximately million 
this commitment may fluctuate due to either price volatility or volumes delivered 
however  we do not anticipate that a financial commitment will be due 
in connection with a gas gathering and processing agreement  we have commitments to deliver bcf of gas over the next five years 
if no gas was delivered  the maximum amount that would be payable under these commitments would be approximately million 
we have other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business  none of which are individually material 
in aggregate  these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable  if no gas is delivered  of approximately million 

table of contents all of the noted commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing bank credit facility will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and planned exploration and development activities 
outlook our exploration and development expenditures program for are projected to range from million to million 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our planned operations  we believe our projected program is likely to occur 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts warrant pursuit of the projects 
production estimates for range from to mmcfe per day 
revenues from production will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized 
during  our realized prices averaged per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil 
prices can be very volatile and the possibility of realized prices being different than they were in is high 
certain expenses for on a per mcfe basis are currently estimated as follows production expense transportation expense dd a and asset retirement obligation general and administrative production taxes of oil and gas revenue critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve significant judgments and discuss the selection and development of these policies and estimates with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances 
table of contents in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
estimations of proved undeveloped reserves can be subject to an even greater possibility of revision 
at year end  percent of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped 
of these proved undeveloped reserves  percent are related to a project in wyoming 
our reserve engineers review and revise our reserve estimates annually 
additionally  we annually engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our proved reserve estimates associated with at least of the discounted future net cash flows before income taxes 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
for depletion purposes  reserve quantities are adjusted at interim quarterly periods for the estimated impact of additions  dispositions and price changes 
changes in reserve quantities cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision 
it is also possible that a full cost ceiling limitation charge could occur in the period of the revision 
the following table presents information regarding reserve revisions largely resulting from items we do not control  such as revisions due to price  and other revisions resulting from better information due to production history  well performance and changes in production costs 
years ended december  bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves revisions resulting from price changes other changes in estimates total non price related revisions added bcfe over the three year period over the same period we have seen a bcfe decrease resulting from lower prices 
see note  supplemental oil and gas disclosures for additional reserve data 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized in earnings unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to our full cost pool 
at the end of each quarter  we make a full cost ceiling limitation calculation  whereby net capitalized costs related to proved properties less associated deferred income taxes may not exceed the amount of the present value discounted at ten percent of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves less estimated future production and development costs and related income tax expense 
future net revenues used in the calculation of the full cost ceiling limitation are determined based on current oil and gas prices and are adjusted for designated cash flow hedges 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or oil and gas prices will cause corresponding changes to the full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
however  if commodity prices increase after period end and before issuance of the financial 
table of contents statements  these higher commodity prices may be used to determine if the capital costs are in fact impaired as of the end of the period 
any recorded impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
due to a significant decrease in period end commodity prices  at september   our ceiling limitation calculation resulted in excess capitalized costs of million million  net of tax  for which we recorded a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties 
as a result of further declines in natural gas and oil prices during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional non cash impairment of oil and gas properties 
based on prices at december   our ceiling limitation calculation resulted in excess capitalized costs of billion billion after tax 
the company s quarterly and annual ceiling test is primarily impacted by period end commodity prices  reserve quantities added and produced  overall exploration and development costs and depletion expense 
holding all factors constant other than commodity prices  a decline in prices as of december  would have resulted in an additional ceiling test impairment of approximately of our full cost pool 
also  goodwill could be potentially impaired 
changes in actual reserve quantities added and produced along with our actual overall exploration and development costs will impact the company s actual ceiling test calculation and impairment analyses 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations 
goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of the company with the recorded net book value including the goodwill  after giving effect to all other period impairments  including the impairment of oil and gas properties from the full cost pool ceiling limitation calculation 
if the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required 
if  however  the estimated fair value is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required  if any 
in this second step  a hypothetical acquisition value of the company is computed utilizing purchase business combination accounting rules 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year 
during the fourth quarter of  there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and oil and gas related commodity prices 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the company for purposes of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
as of december   the book value per share of our common stock exceeded the market price by less than per share 
management does not consider the market value of our shares to be an accurate reflection of our net assets  for impairment purposes 
to estimate the fair value of the company  we used all available information  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 
this estimated fair value differs significantly from the valuation used in the ceiling limitation calculation  which requires the use of prices and costs in effect at year end  discounted at percent 
the ceiling calculation is not intended to be indicative of fair value 
in estimating the fair value of our oil and gas properties  we used projected future prices based on the nymex strip index at december  adjusted for estimated delivery point price differentials 
based on our current exploration plans  we included estimated future cash flows from development of our unproved properties and applied a discount rate of to  depending on the reserve category 
this resulted in a slight excess of fair value over the carrying value of our net assets at year end 
should lower prices or quantities result in the future  or higher discount rates be necessary  the carrying value of our net assets may exceed the estimated fair value  resulting in an impairment of goodwill 

table of contents contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
in january  the tulsa county district court issued a judgment in the hb krug  et al versus helmerich payne  inc h p case 
this lawsuit was originally filed in and addressed h p s conduct pertaining to a take or pay settlement  along with potential drainage issues and other related matters 
damages of million plus million for disgorgement of h p s estimated potential compounded profit since  resulting from the noted damages  were awarded to plaintiff royalty owners  for a total of million 
this amount was subsequently adjusted by the court to a total of million 
pursuant to the spin off transaction to shareholders of h p by which cimarex became a publicly traded entity  cimarex assumed the assets and liabilities of h p s exploration and production business 
we periodically assess the probability of estimable amounts related to litigation matters  as required by financial accounting standard no 
accounting for contingencies and adjust our accruals accordingly 
in september  based on the available information at the time  we accrued an estimated litigation expense of million for both damages and probable disgorgement 
the higher disgorgement award could not be reasonably estimated until the final judgment in january we therefore accrued an additional million  bringing the total accrued litigation expense for the year ended december  to million for this lawsuit 
we have appealed the district court s judgments 
in the normal course of business  we have other various litigation related matters and associated accruals 
though some of the related claims may be significant  the resolution of them we believe  individually or in the aggregate  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimates of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of these costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we revised our existing estimated asset retirement obligation by million  or approximately percent of the asset retirement obligation at december   due to changes in the various related attributes 
over the past three years  revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation averaged approximately percent 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of 
table of contents assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recently issued accounting standards in may   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  that will impact the accounting for the components of convertible debt that can be settled wholly or partly in cash upon conversion 
the new requirements apply not only to new instruments  but also would be applied retrospectively to previously issued convertible instruments 
the debt and equity components of the instruments are to be accounted for separately 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated value of similar debt without a conversion feature as of the issuance date  with the remaining proceeds allocated to the equity component and recorded as additional paid in capital 
the debt component is recorded at a discount and is subsequently accreted to its par value  thereby reflecting an overall market rate of interest in the income statement 
this staff position is effective for both new and previously issued instruments for current and comparative periods in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
we will adopt this in the first quarter of upon adoption  without considering tax effects  we will retrospectively record a decrease in the book value of our floating rate convertible notes of approximately million as of june   and a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
in addition  we will record additional non cash interest expense of approximately million per year for  and in june   the fasb issued a new staff position eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which holds that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities as defined by eitf as securities that may participate in undistributed earnings with common stock  whether that participation is conditioned upon the occurrence of a specified event or not  regardless of the form of participation  and therefore should be included in computing earnings per share using the two class earnings allocation method 
the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
this staff position is effective for financial statements issued in fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
once effective  the requirements will be applied by restating previously reported earnings per share data 
we will adopt this in the first quarter of item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and value of our short term investments 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
price fluctuations our major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable see risk factors in item 
currently  we are largely accepting the volatility risk that the change in prices presents 
none of our future oil and gas production is subject to hedging 
at december   our derivative contracts were completed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 

table of contents interest rate risk at december   we had total debt outstanding of million 
of this amount  million is outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility and million is senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of and will mature on may  the credit facility matures on july  and amounts outstanding bear interest at our election at either a floating libor rate plus or the prime rate plus 
the remaining debt of our unsecured convertible senior notes is million face value which matures on december  these convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of three month libor  reset quarterly 
the book value of our revolving credit facility and the convertible notes approximates the current fair value 
the fair value of our notes was approximately million at december  we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because as of december  about of our long term debt obligations were at fixed rates 
a increase in the three month libor rate would increase annual interest expense by million 
this sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding debt 
market value of investments we currently have million invested in an asset backed securities fund 
we expect to liquidate our investment in this fund within the next months 
a five percent change in these investments market value would have a thousand impact on our investments
