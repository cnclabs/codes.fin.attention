item a 
risk factors the following risks could affect and in some cases have affected the company s actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from estimates or expectations reflected in certain forward looking statements the company s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect its financial health  its ability to obtain financing in the future  and its ability to react to changes in its business 
as of december   the company had an aggregate principal amount of approximately billion of outstanding debt 
because of the company s substantial debt  the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be restricted in the future 
the company is also exposed to the risk of increased interest costs because approximately billion of its debt is at variable rates of interest 
as such  a significant portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes 
in  the company estimates it will pay between million and million in interest on its outstanding debt obligations 
additionally  the company s credit agreement contains covenants that prohibit or restrict  among other things  the disposal of assets  the incurrence of additional indebtedness including guarantees  payment of 
table of contents dividends  loans or advances and certain other types of transactions 
the covenants also require compliance with a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio 
the company s ability to comply in future periods with the financial covenants will depend on its ongoing financial and operating performance 
the substantial debt and the restrictions under the credit agreement could limit the company s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures  as well as its ability to withstand competitive pressures 
the material outstanding debt obligations and the credit agreement restrictions may also leave the company more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or its business or unable to carry out capital expenditures that are necessary or important to its growth strategy and productivity improvement programs 
in light of the continuing volatility in the financial services industry  the company s reliance on a large number of financial institutions for a significant portion of its cash requirements could adversely affect the company s liquidity and cash flow 
the credit and securities markets exhibited extreme volatility and disruption throughout the company has exposure to many companies in the financial services industry  particularly commercial and investment banks who participate in its revolving credit facility and who are counterparties to the company s interest rate swaps and natural gas and currency hedges 
the failure of these financial institutions  or their inability or unwillingness to fund the company s revolving credit facility or fulfill their obligations under swaps and hedges could have a material adverse affect on the company s liquidity position and cash flow 
reduced availability of credit may adversely affect the ability of some of the company s customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures 
this could negatively impact the company s ability to timely collect receivables and to obtain raw materials and supplies 
significant increases in prices for raw materials  energy  transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the company s financial results 
availability of and increases in the costs of raw materials  including petroleum based materials  the cost of energy  the cost of wood primarily for the west monroe mill  transportation and other necessary services could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company is also limited in its ability to pass along such cost increases to customers due to contractual provisions and competitive reasons 
there is no guarantee that the company s efforts to reduce costs will be successful 
the company utilizes a global continuous improvement initiative that uses statistical process control to help design and manage many types of activities  including production and maintenance 
the company s ability to implement successfully its business strategies and to realize anticipated savings is subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these strategies include the infrastructure and reliability improvements at the company s west monroe mill 
if the company cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions or other cost savings plans it may not be able to compete successfully against other manufacturers 
in addition  any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the company s financial results 
work stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for the company to manufacture and distribute its products  which could result in decreased sales or increased costs  either of which would negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of the company s workforce is represented by labor unions  whose goals and objectives may differ significantly from the company s 
the company may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts covering the employees at its various sites without work stoppages or labor difficulties 
these events may also occur as a result of other factors 
a prolonged disruption at any of the company s facilities due to work stoppages or labor difficulties could have a material adverse effect on its net 
table of contents sales  margins and cash flows 
in addition  if new union contracts contain significant increases in wages or other benefits  the company s margins would be adversely impacted 
the company may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights  which could harm its future success and competitive position 
the company s future success and competitive position depend in part upon its ability to obtain and maintain protection for certain proprietary carton and packaging machine technologies used in its value added products  particularly those incorporating the fridge vendor  integrapak  microflex q  microrite  quilt wave  qwik crisp  z flute  and di na cal technologies 
failure to protect the company s existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or may require it to license other companies intellectual property rights 
it is possible that any of the patents owned by the company may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to others or any of its pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by the company  if at all 
further  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technologies  duplicate its technologies or design around its patents  and steps taken by the company to protect its technologies may not prevent misappropriation of such technologies 
the company is subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and costs to comply with such laws and regulations  or any liability or obligation imposed under such laws or regulations  could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to a broad range of foreign  federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing discharges to air  soil and water  the management  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of hazardous substances  and the health and safety of employees 
environmental liabilities and obligations may result in significant costs  which could negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operations outside the us are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries 
the company has several converting plants in foreign countries and sells its products worldwide 
for  before intercompany eliminations  net sales from operations outside of the us represented approximately of the company s net sales 
the company s revenues from export sales fluctuate with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   approximately of its total assets were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company has significant operations in countries that use the british pound sterling  the australian dollar  the japanese yen or the euro as their functional currencies 
the company cannot predict major currency fluctuations 
the company pursues a currency hedging program in order to limit the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on financial results 
the company is also subject to the following significant risks associated with operating in foreign countries adverse political and economic conditions  compliance with and enforcement of environmental  health and safety and labor laws and other regulations of the foreign countries in which the company operates  export compliance  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  and imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 
if any of the above events were to occur  the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted  possibly materially 

table of contents the anticipated benefits of combining the operations of the company and altivity may not be fully realized  and the company may face difficulties integrating altivity s operations 
the company and bch entered into the altivity transaction with the expectation that the transaction would result in various benefits  including  among other things  cost synergies and operating efficiencies 
however  the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction  including the cost synergies  cannot be assured or may take longer than expected 
in addition  the company may not be able to integrate altivity s operations with the company s existing operations without encountering difficulties  including inconsistencies in standards  systems and controls  the diversion of management s focus and resources from ordinary business activities and opportunities  difficulties in achieving expected cost savings associated with the transaction  difficulties in the assimilation of employees and in creating a unified corporate culture  challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers  and challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel 
these risks may be exacerbated by the fact that altivity is the result of the combination of the smurfit stone container corporation s consumer packaging division and the field companies in as a result of these risks  the company may not be able to realize the expected revenue and cash flow growth and other benefits that it expects to achieve from the transaction 
in addition  the company may be required to spend additional time or money on integration efforts that would otherwise have been spent on the development and expansion of its business and services
