overview headquartered in mountain view  california  lasercard corporation  together with its subsidiaries  is a leading provider of secure id solutions to governments and commercial clients worldwide 
we develop  manufacture  and integrate lasercard optical memory cards omcs  encoders  peripherals  smart and specialty cards  biometrics  and modular software 
our cards and systems are used in various applications  including citizen identification  government service delivery and facility access 
our cards and systems are used in countries around the world  such as the united states  germany  united kingdom  switzerland  angola  italy  india  costa rica and the kingdom of saudi arabia  for demanding applications including government service provision and facility access 
lasercard s wholly owned german subsidiary  ccd  with offices in rastede and ratingen  germany  manufactures and offers a wide range of high quality specialty cards  plus card personalization and id management solutions under the ccd and cards more brands 
the majority of our revenue is from sales of products and services through partners such as value added resellers vars and system integrators sis who generally have specific experience in the development of markets and applications for lasercard products 
we have sales staff located in california  the washington dc area and germany  whose principal role is developing and supporting our vars and sis reseller channel 
our revenues are derived mainly from advanced technology cards used in government identity programs  such as optical memory  contact  contactless and rfid cards  and from high quality specialty cards for applications such as major event badging and access control 
the remainder of our revenues comes from the sale of enabling services  such as consulting  custom application development and the integration of id management solution modules  such as data capture  card personalization and quality assurance  and from equipment sales  knowledge transfer and licensing 
our reseller partners generally add value in the form of application software development  system integration  installation  training and support services 
we are continuing our program to recruit new vars and sis in strategically important markets 
we emphasize selling secure credentials into government programs for individual identification 
we offer a range of products including cards that contain magnetic stripe  contactless radio frequency identification rfid  contact ic chip  optical memory  holograms  biometric identification  or a combination of such features 
this allows us to sell to a wide range of customers around the world 
omcs are a proprietary product of lasercard for which we hold us patents 
in addition  we have years of know how in the manufacture and use of cards  encoding devices  read write drives  systems  enabling services and software 
this provides a basis for highly leveraged contribution margins in the omc segment 
therefore  our strategy is to sell all card technologies with a goal to upgrade programs to optical memory when possible 
we sell encoders and read write drives at near direct manufacturing cost to enable sales of optical memory cards 
this often results in negative gross profits for our drives  systems and enabling services segment when equipment volume does not allow for the contribution necessary to cover fixed costs and we do not have sizable enabling services 
even at higher volume  the gross profit margin on encoders and read write drives will probably not exceed 
we provide enabling services as a strategy to promote card sales 
examples include the furnishing of equipment  training and management of a card issuance system for the kingdom of saudi arabia national id card program  and a complete data collection  data base  and card issuing system for the costa rica foreign resident id card program and the national id card program in angola 
the major near term growth potential for lasercard optical memory cards is in government sponsored identification programs in several countries 
since governmental card programs typically rely on policy making  which in turn is subject to technical requirements  budget approvals  and political considerations  there is no assurance that these programs will be implemented as expected  that they will include optical cards or our products 
our principal strategies for long term revenue growth are to o maintain  leverage and expand the existing optical memory card user community of national and regional governments worldwide  o increase revenues by offering enabling services  such as consulting  custom software development  and the development of integrated secure id solutions  which can include data capture  personalization  quality assurance modules  and o increase market share for specialized cards and associated id management solutions  such as major event badging and access control and university student id 
currently our optical memory card segment revenues are mainly derived from the following programs  the us dhs green card programs  a national id card for the kingdom of saudi arabia  three state level vehicle registration card programs in india  a foreign resident id card program in italy  and the foreign resident id card program in costa rica 
also there are emerging programs such as the national citizen id card program in italy  a government agency card program in italy  and the recently announced national id card program in angola 
we may invest up to million during fiscal year in additional capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures for optical memory card and specialty card production capacity and manufacturing enhancement at our facilities as necessary for increased volumes and for manufacturing efficiency 
accounting period for purposes of presentation  we label our annual accounting period end as march and our quarterly accounting period ends as june  september and december in fact  we operate and report based on quarterly periods ending on the friday closest to month end 
fiscal year ended on april   fiscal year ended on march   and fiscal year ended on march  consolidated results of operations revenues the table below presents consolidated revenues recorded by our us and german operations for the fiscal years ended march in thousands us operations german operations revenues recorded by our us operations are generally derived from a small number of government customers located throughout the world 
revenues recorded by our german operations are mainly from a relatively large number of commercial customers in emea  including universities in germany for student identification cards and organizers of sporting events for secure access cards 
our major customers are shown below as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years ended march omar k 
acss communications and space services company ltd 
acss general dynamics information technology gdit gemalto sa gemalto our major government card programs are shown below as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years ended march kingdom of saudi arabia national id program united states green cards other programs each less than foreign resident id card program in costa rica various card programs in italy canadian permanent resident cards national id card in angola the us green card program for the dhs has been an important part of our revenue base 
we recorded revenues of million during fiscal year and approximately million in each of the prior two fiscal years 
dhs has been gradually reducing its inventory of current cards that had been designed in as it transitions its infrastructure to issue the newly designed green cards 
this attributed to the decrease in revenue during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year in january   we received a purchase order for approximately million for the supply of new advanced us permanent resident cards the green card 
deliveries on this order are expected to be completed during fiscal another us government program  the bcc  which accounted for approximately million in revenue during the past fiscal year was redesigned in keeping with the requirements of the western hemisphere travel initiative and is now supplied by another manufacturer 
revenues for this program totaled million in each of the prior two fiscal years 
we also supply secure national id cards to the kingdom of saudi arabia 
we recorded revenues of million  million  and million for this program during fiscal years   and  respectively 
we anticipate ongoing revenues to be in the range of to million per year 
our backlog at march  for this program totaled million 
we supply optical memory cards for vehicle registration programs for three states in india 
revenues for these programs totaled million  million  and million during fiscal years   and  respectively 
we expect ongoing orders to be in the range of million to million per year 
for costa rica s new foreign resident id card  introduced in june  their department of immigration dgme selected lasercard s tamper proof optical memory technology featuring layered security 
the move was designed to bring costa rica s dgme closer to its vision of a regional standard in identity credentials to facilitate cross border travel and strengthened security across multiple countries in the americas 
we were also instrumental to the introduction of their new nationwide data capture facilities designed to accelerate use of the new  highly secure id card by the country s  legal foreign residents 
we recorded revenue of million during fiscal year for this program 
in italy  we are the supplier of optical card stock for secure government identification programs  starting with the citizen id card  italian cie cards  the italian pse cards  the cse cards  and italian s ministry of justice id cards 
the cie cards are currently being issued in low volume 
we believe that conflicts over the cards validity period continues to be the main hurdle for initiation of volume issuance 
in march  we received an order from our var  laser memory card spa for approximately million for foreign resident id cards and for special bi lingual versions of the cie cards which we partially delivered during the quarter ended march  meanwhile  the italian ministry of justice id cards continue to be personalized and issued to ministry employees by italy s state printer and prime contractor  istituto poligrafico e zucca dello stato spa poligrafico 
we recorded revenue of million  million  and million during fiscal years   and  respectively  for all of these italian programs 
our backlog at march  for the various programs in italy totaled million 
under a subcontract for canada s permanent resident cards  we recorded revenue of million  million  and million during fiscal years   and  respectively 
this subcontract expired on march  a small final order valued at million will be delivered by june in january  the government of angola announced a contract award to dgm sistemas dgm  of luanda  angola  for the delivery of a complete id management system 
the contract calls for an initial million optical memory cards for the country s new national citizen id program to be issued as the infrastructure is built 
up to an additional million cards could be issued later 
we teamed with dgm as the exclusive supplier of cards for the project 
other team members include unisys corporation nyse uis which is responsible for systems integration and our value added reseller  identicard sa of portugal  which developed the system architecture 
the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity subcontract includes million of products and services to be provided by lasercard including optical memory cards  card personalization systems  and printer consumables over five years 
we recorded revenue of million for card personalization equipment and consumables during fiscal year our backlog at march  for this order includes million for optical memory cards 
card deliveries for this order are expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal year and continue throughout the fiscal year 
revenues 
our total revenues consisted of sales in our three segments of optical memory cards  drives  systems and enabling services  and specialty cards and card printers  as well as  at times  other miscellaneous items 
total revenues for fiscal years   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the following table presents our consolidated revenues by segment for the fiscal years ended march in thousands  except for percentages change vs change vs optical memory cards of total revenues optical card drives  systems  and enabling services of total revenues specialty cards and card printers of total revenues elimination of intersegment revenue of total revenues total revenues increase year over year the following table presents our optical memory card revenues by major program for the fiscal years ended march in thousands change vs change vs national id cards in the kingdom of saudi arabia us green cards laser visas vehicle registration in india italian government id card programs foreign resident id card in costa rica canadian permanent resident cards all other programs total optical memory card revenues increase year over year optical memory card revenues for fiscal year increased by million or as compared to fiscal year due to increased volume for the kingdom of saudi arabia s national id card program  the italian government s foreign resident card program and the costa rican permanent resident card program 
while we will no longer supply cards for the us government s bcc program and the canadian government s permanent resident card program  we expect growth in fiscal year due to the implementation of angola s national id card program  the redesigned green card in the us and other new programs 
optical memory card revenues for fiscal year increased by million or as compared to fiscal year due to the increased card sales volume for the kingdom of saudi arabia s national id card program  the canadian permanent resident card program and the vehicle registration program in india which offset the decreased card unit volume in the italian and other card programs 
revenues in the drives  systems and enabling services segment for fiscal year increased by million or as compared to fiscal year due to the implementation of the credential issuance system in costa rica on the comprehensive end to end solutions that we developed  the implementation of the regionalized model for the national id card program in the kingdom of saudi arabia  and the delivery of the card personalization equipment and consumables for a complete id management system in angola 
revenues in the drives  systems and enabling services segment for fiscal year increased by million or as compared to fiscal year due to delivery of drives and systems for the national id card program in the kingdom of saudi arabia  and the id programs in italy 
specialty cards and card printers revenues for fiscal year increased by million or as compared to fiscal year due to our subsidiary s focus on innovations in accreditation and access control applications for our core customers  including a major sporting event operator and our partners serving the majority of german universities 
we also delivered equipment and consumables for a complete id management system in angola 
the weakening world economy will probably have a negative effect on some portions of the specialty cards and card printers segment 
specialty cards and card printers revenues for fiscal year increased by million or as compared to fiscal year attributable to a favorable effect of euro dollar exchange rate of approximately and increased orders from a major sporting event operator 
backlog some of our customers generally place orders for a period of several months to a year or more  and others place orders for immediate or fast turn delivery 
variations in order placement from a single customer can materially affect backlog 
as a result  the relative size of our backlog has not been a reliable indicator of future revenue trends 
our backlog for optical memory cards as of march  was million and million for specialty cards and card printers 
there was no significant backlog for optical card drives  systems and enabling services as of march  gross margin the following table presents our gross margin in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue by segment for the fiscal years ended march in thousands  except for percentages change vs change vs optical memory cards of optical memory card revenues optical card drives  systems and services of optical card drive revenues nm nm nm specialty cards and card printers of specialty cards and card printers total gross margin of total revenue omcs 
omc gross margin can vary significantly based upon changes in average selling price  production and sales volumes  mix of card types  production efficiency and yields  and changes in fixed costs 
production unit volume greatly affects gross margin due to the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
omc gross margin for fiscal year was of omc revenue as compared to of omc revenue for fiscal year the combined favorable impact of increased sales volume in several major id card programs  productivity improvements  and manufacturing cost reduction initiatives attributed to the increased gross margin 
depreciation and amortization was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the non cash charge for the reserve of obsolete inventory was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
optical memory card gross margin for fiscal year was of omc revenue as compared to of omc revenue for fiscal year the increase in omc gross margin was mainly due to a increase in sales volume in several major id card programs and product mix 
depreciation and amortization was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
drives  systems and enabling services 
except for the quarter ended june   drives  systems and enabling services gross margin has been negative over the past three years  inclusive of fixed overhead costs  due to low sales volume and our policy to price drives close to direct manufacturing cost to promote card sales resulting in the inability to cover fixed costs at current sales volumes 
this segment also includes enabling services  which also have lower margins than optical memory cards 
the increased costs associated with the implementation of enabling services capabilities  the non cash charges of approximately million for obsolete inventory and the million write off of obsolete equipment further attributed to the negative gross margin for this segment albeit revenue increased by during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year depreciation and amortization was approximately million for each of the fiscal years and we anticipate that drives  systems and enabling services negative gross margins will continue in the future unless equipment sales volume is sufficient to cover fixed costs or there is material amount of enabling services revenue 
gross margin decreased by approximately million despite improved sales during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to our policy to price drives close to direct manufacturing cost to promote card sales 
depreciation and amortization was approximately million for each of the fiscal years and specialty cards and card printers 
the gross margin on specialty cards and card printers was of revenue for fiscal year as compared with for fiscal year our long term time and material contract in serbia concluded during the quarter ended march  contributing approximately to the overall gross margin in this segment 
productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reduction initiatives also attributed to the increase 
due to the current economic conditions  we anticipate pressure on selling prices for specialty cards leading to lower margins in this segment unless offset by the continuation of increased revenues of the higher value printer and systems products 
our gross margins in this segment will also be harmed in the future as compared to fiscal year by the conclusion of our serbia contract 
we may not be able to mitigate fluctuations in foreign exchange through our forward contracts 
this may cause adverse impact on our foreign operations 
the gross margin on specialty cards and card printers was for fiscal year as compared to gross margin of for fiscal year operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for the fiscal years ended march in thousands  except for percentages change vs change vs selling  general and administrative expenses of change from prior year of revenue research and development expenses of change from prior year of revenue impairment of goodwill and intangible assets total operating expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a

research and development expenses r d 
r d expenses for fiscal year decreased by million  or as compared to fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  r d expenses were in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year during fiscal  various r d projects were realigned and cost reductions were implemented consistent with a milestone based r d strategy 
we are continuing our effort to develop new optical memory card and non optical card features and structures  including various composite card structures to allow the insertion of contactless chips with rf capability  dual interface contact contactless with optical memory  ovd products  and other market driven requirements 
we are also developing enhanced optical memory card read write drives for both increased reliability and ease of use and integration  and new software products and services in an effort to provide new products that can stimulate optical memory card sales growth 
we anticipate that these ongoing research and development efforts should result in enhanced card features and capabilities and drives with advanced security features and or lower manufacturing costs  however  there is no assurance that such product development effort will be successful 
these features are important for our existing and future optical memory card markets 
we anticipate r d expenditures of about million per quarter during fiscal year r d expenses for fiscal year decreased by million  or as compared to fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  r d expenses were in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on march   upon review of our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets  we determined that estimated future cash flows from our purchase of ccd were insufficient to justify the carrying value of our goodwill based on management s decision to suspend significant optical memory card production in germany 
as such  we recorded a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of approximately million to write off the goodwill and indefinite lived other intangible assets to comply with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other income expense  net the following table presents other income expense  net  for the fiscal years ended march in thousands interest income interest expense loss due to fair value of investments other income expense other income expense  net 
interest income for fiscal year decreased by million  or as compared to fiscal year due to a decline in interest rates from a weighted average of for fiscal down to for fiscal the increase of interest expense for fiscal year by million  or as compared to fiscal year was largely due to the effects on premiums from our forward currency contracts 
the loss on fair value of the ars investments  net of gain on the fair value of the put option  resulted in approximately million non cash charge during fiscal year we believe that if the assumptions that we used for ubs credit risk remain unchanged through june   we will recover this loss in future periods up to the quarter ended june  the other income and expense was mainly due to losses or gains on foreign exchange fluctuations 
interest income for fiscal year decreased by million  or as compared to fiscal year due to a decrease in invested funds and a decline in interest rates from a weighted average of for fiscal down to for fiscal the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was mainly due to improved management of the forward contracts 
the other income and expense during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was immaterial 
income taxes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  which for us was the fiscal year commencing on april  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption of fin on april   we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of  decreasing its income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and decreasing the march  accumulated deficit balance 
we continually monitor the need for tax reserves under fin during fiscal years and  we did not identify any new reserve requirements 
as of march   the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of interest and penalties  was approximately  and the entire amount  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
we do not currently anticipate that any significant increase or decrease to unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during the next months 
as of march   the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of interest and penalties  was approximately  and the entire amount  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows balance as of march  interest and penalties balance as of march  interest and penalties balance as of march  we recorded an income tax expense of approximately  for fiscal year the book pre tax loss for the us operations was approximately million 
taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million 
a portion of our net operating loss carryover nol was used to offset our taxable income 
however  we were only allowed to offset of our taxable income with nol and we were subject to alternative minimum tax 
california also suspended the utilization of net operating losses for the tax years and additionally  california limited the utilization of r d credits to of the tax liability without consideration for net operating losses 
our germany operations showed taxable income of approximately million 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  for our german operations as a majority of our german gaap profit was offset by net operating losses 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the tax benefit for fiscal year was due mainly to the reduction of deferred income tax liabilities in germany offset by an adjustment related to a tax reserve for fin the payments from prevent global received through fiscal year ended march  were recorded as income on the federal tax return even though they were not recorded as income under us generally accepted accounting principles 
this income was offset by net operating loss carryforwards nols generated in previous years 
however  alternative minimum taxes were due when tax return income was offset by nols generated in previous years 
a full valuation allowance was required at the end of fiscal years   and considering both the positive and negative evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes cash  cash equivalents and investments as of march in thousands cash and cash equivalents long term investments as of march   we held million par value with a fair value of approximately million  of marketable securities consisting of arss that were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
ubs offered and we accepted a rights offering whereby ubs offered to purchase certain arss it placed  including those we hold  at par or face value 
also included in our long term investment is the put option received in this rights offering from ubs 
the transfer resulted in the reversal of prior unrealized losses  net of taxes  on the ars from accumulated other comprehensive income and the recording of an other than temporary impairment of approximately million on the million par value portion of our ars portfolio and the recognition of a benefit of approximately million related to the put option provided by the settlement

the following table displays the sources and uses of cash by activity for the fiscal years ended march in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  compared to net cash used by operating activities of million for fiscal year the million in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was due to million provided by the net loss adjusted by non cash charges of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  the net effect of the loss due to fair value of the ars investment and the gain on the put option and other miscellaneous items  all partially offset by the million cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal year consists of million used due to the net loss  net of non cash items  partially offset by the million of cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal year primarily consists of million used due to the loss in operations  net of non cash items  million received from prevent global  net of equipment purchased for this contract  and million used in changes in other operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year  compared to million of cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year capital expenditures for fiscal year were million  mainly due to addition of new and improved production equipment in our optical memory card business 
acquisition of patents and changes in the restricted cash balance contributed million to the net balance 
we may further invest million in additional capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures for optical memory card and specialty card production capacity and manufacturing enhancement at our facilities through march  net cash provided by investing activities of million during fiscal year consisted of million from net proceeds of maturity of investments  less capital expenditures and changes in noncurrent assets of million 
net cash provided by investing activities of million during fiscal year consisted primarily of million from net proceeds of maturity of investments  less capital expenditures of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year  compared to million of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year the increase in cash in financing activities for fiscal year was mainly due to the million drawn from the ubs credit line and the net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock plans 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal years and consisted of net proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock plans 
current borrowing arrangements as of march   we held million par value with a fair value of approximately million  of marketable securities consisting of arss that were classified as noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
ubs offered and we accepted a rights offering whereby ubs offered to purchase certain arss it placed  including those we hold  at par or face value 
as part of the offering  we obtained a line of credit in the amount of million that was collateralized by the slarss 
we drew down the full amount as of march the intent of the credit line is to provide a no cost loan where the interest rate charged on the credit line is equal to the interest rate earned on the arss 
variable rate advances under the ubs credit line will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lesser of a libor  plus a percentage rate between to  depending on the amount of the advance  and b the then applicable weighted average rate of interest or dividend rate paid to us by the issuer of the arss  and in each case  such interest rate is subject to adjustment at any time and from time to time to reflect changes in the composition of the arss 
when calculating the weighted average interest rate  the interest rate paid to us with respect to the arss equal to  i for the period up to and including january   the applicable coupon rate s and ii from january  and thereafter  the then applicable taxable slarc maximum auction rate for the taxable slarss 
the ubs credit line also provides  among other things  that o ubs may demand full or partial payment of the credit line at its sole discretion and without cause at any time  and o ubs may at any time in its sole discretion terminate and cancel the credit line  provided  however  that ubs is required to provide to us alternative financing on substantially similar terms  unless the demand right was exercised as a result of certain specified events or the customer relationship between ubs and lasercard is terminated for cause by ubs 
refer to note  caption  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments of the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our noncurrent investments 
we believe that we have sufficient available cash to execute our business plan for fiscal year as we expect the estimated level of revenues to be sufficient to generate cash from operating activities over the same period 
we expect to recover the par value of the arss based on our rights agreement with ubs 
operating cash flows could be negatively impacted to a significant degree if our largest us government program were to be delayed  reduced  canceled  or not extended  if the angolan national id card program does not materialize as planned internally  and if these programs are not replaced by other card orders or other sources of income 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of the effect on liquidity and cash flows from our contractual obligations for the following years ended march in thousands thereafter total non cancelable operating leases non cancelable purchase orders net borrowing on revolving credit with ubs total includes capitalized leases for the purposes of this table  the obligation has been calculated without interest obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements as of march  and march  application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenues  inventories  stock based compensation  warranties  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our critical accounting policies are those that both are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often requiring estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies reflect our significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
product sales primarily consist of sales of optical cards  drives  systems and services  and specialty cards and card printers 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on product sales at the time of shipment when shipping terms are fob shipping point  orders are placed pursuant to a pre existing sales arrangement  and there are no post shipment obligations other than customer acceptance criteria or  in the case of a us government contract  warehousing 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns 
orders for permanent resident and border crossing cards for the us government require delivery into a secure company controlled vault 
shipments are later made from the vault to a us government site 
the bill and hold procedures also provide that at the end of any one year contract term when a renewal option is not exercised  the us government is to take final delivery of any and all of its remaining inventory within six months 
at the time the cards are delivered into the vault  title to the cards is transferred to the us government and all risks of ownership are transferred as well 
the prime contractor is invoiced  with payment due within thirty days and the purchase orders do not contain any return other than for warranty or cancellation provisions 
pursuant to the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  revenue is recognized on delivery into the vault as we have fulfilled its contractual obligations and the earnings process is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met and presuming that all other revenue criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period  or as we render services and the customer accepts them 
we apply the provisions of the emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides criteria governing how to identify whether goods or services that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
deliverables are accounted for separately if they meet all of the following criteria a the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer  b the fair value of any undelivered items can be reliably determined  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return  delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the seller 
in situations where the deliverables fall within higher level literature as defined by eitf  we apply the guidance in that higher level literature 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are combined with one or more other deliverables 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop no 
in applicable contracts 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized as services are rendered at contract labor rates plus material and other direct costs incurred 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
estimates of costs to complete include material  direct labor  overhead and allowable general and administrative expenses 
in circumstances where estimates of costs to complete a project cannot be reasonably estimated  but it is assured that a loss will not be incurred  the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin  rather than the completed contract method  is used until more precise estimates can be made 
the full amount of an estimated loss is charged to operations in the period it is determined that a loss will be realized from the performance of a contract 
our long term program accounted for under sop concluded during the last quarter of fiscal year with revenue of approximately  during fiscal year for the year ended march  and  we recognized revenue of approximately  and  respectively  based on a zero profit margin 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
revenue from the license of our software products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable  and  if applicable  upon acceptance when acceptance criteria are specified or upon expiration of the acceptance period 
software revenue was immaterial for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
product warranty 
where appropriate  provision is made at the time of shipment for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns 
we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
our limited warranty requires us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the customer within a specified time period after sale 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our estimate of warranty liability include the number of units sold  and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims 
we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
we utilize historical trends and information received from our customers to assist in determining the appropriate estimated warranty accrual levels 
accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain and is subject to challenge by taxing authorities in the united states  california  and in germany 
tax years through remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies  mainly the united states  due to tax loss carryovers from those years 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increase or decreases in our effective tax rate 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  which for us was the fiscal year commencing on april  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption of fin on april   we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of  decreasing its income tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and decreasing the march  accumulated deficit balance 
we continually monitor the need for tax reserves under fin during fiscal years and  we did not identify any new reserve requirements 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including nols  foreign tax credits  and other income tax credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
if and when we release the valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
we evaluate the need for a valuation or a change thereto  on a quarterly basis 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or market value with market value based on replacement cost or estimated realizable value less cost to sell 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasts of product demand 
demand for optical card drives can fluctuate significantly 
in order to obtain favorable pricing  purchases of certain read write drive parts are made in quantities that exceed the booked orders 
we purchase drive parts for our anticipated demand and takes into consideration the order to delivery lead times of vendors and the economic purchase order quantity for such parts 
in addition  we keep a supply of card raw materials that we deem necessary for anticipated demand 
we use standard costs which approximate the first in  first out costing method 
we perform an analysis of the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis 
with respect to inventory carrying values  we follow the principles articulated in sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas no 
 arb no 
 chapter inventory pricing  paragraphs through and and other authoritative guidance eg sab as it relates to determining the appropriate cost basis of inventory and determining whether firm  noncancelable purchase commitments should be accrued as a loss if forecasted demand is not sufficient to utilize all such committed inventory purchases and the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
following sfas no 
 we allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we applied sfas no 
to inventory costs incurred effective april  the provisions of this statement were applied prospectively 
we establish aged inventory reserves and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when management determines that an item is not readily saleable 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
as part of our quarterly excess obsolete inventory analysis  we also determine whether lower of cost or market adjustments ie  where selling prices less certain costs are not sufficient to recover inventory carrying values are warranted 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform an annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets to comply with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
at march   we determined that estimated future cash flows were insufficient to justify the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets related to the march   acquisition of our german operations based on management s decision to suspend significant optical memory card production in germany 
as such  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge of approximately million to write off these goodwill and other intangible assets 
during fiscal years and  the future cash flows had been determined to be sufficient based in part on planned production of a portion of our optical memory cards in our facility in germany 
there was no impairment charge during fiscal year or we intend to continue to use the facility and equipment in germany to produce specialty cards although plans to use the facility to produce lasercard optical memory cards in germany were suspended during fiscal year share based compensation 
as described in detail in note  stock based compensation  of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the vesting period of the award 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based awards  stock price volatility  and pre vesting stock option forfeitures 
we estimated the expected life of stock options granted during fiscal year ended march  based upon vesting provision and historical exercise  cancellation  and expiration patterns 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  our net income applicable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended march  includes million of share based compensation expense from stock options and approximately million of employee stock purchase plan expense included in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the fiscal year ended march  our share based compensation expense included million from stock options and million of employee stock purchase plan expensed in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of march   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based compensation arrangements is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period through august as of march   about million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options  restricted share awards and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period through december short and long term investments 
short term investments include securities with maturities at date of purchase of more than three months and investments with remaining maturities of less than one year 
all investments with maturities at date of purchase greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates the classification of investments as of each balance sheet date 
we account for short term marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

we consider all highly liquid investments  consisting primarily of commercial paper  discount notes  us government bonds  and arss  with original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
all investments with original or remaining maturities of more than three months but not more than one year at the date of purchase are classified as short term 
investments with original or remaining maturities of more than one year at the date of purchase are classified as noncurrent assets 
we determine the length of our investments after considering our cash requirements and yields available for the type of investment considered by us 
we determine the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate the classification of investments as of each balance sheet date 
we had classified all of our arss as noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next twelve months is uncertain and these investments had been designated as trading securities 
trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported our consolidated statement of operations under other income expense  net 
we had no investments in marketable securities designated as available for sale as of march  as of march   our ars investments had been accounted for as available for sale and classified as long term securities 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
we held no short term investments as of march  refer to note  caption  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments of the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our noncurrent investments

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments  and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related financial assets and liabilities differently 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option is elected would be reported in earnings 
we adopted sfas no 
as of april   but we have not elected to measure financial instruments and other items at fair value except for the company s long term investments on ars during fiscal year ended march  see note  caption below  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  for additional details 
other material financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value  such as our short term debt obligations and trade accounts receivable and accounts payable  are still reported at their carrying values 
any other future transacted financial asset or liability will be evaluated for the fair value election as prescribed by sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk 
we invest our cash  beyond that needed for daily operations  in high quality debt securities 
in doing so  we seek primarily to preserve the value and liquidity of our capital and  secondarily  to safely earn income from these investments 
to accomplish these goals  we invest only in debt securities issued by a the us treasury and us government agencies  state agencies and corporations and b debt instruments that meet the following criteria o commercial paper rated a p or debt instruments rated aaa  as rated by the major rating services o can readily be sold for cash investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our short term borrowings under our credit line agreement with ubs wherein we drew down an aggregate of million as of fiscal year ended march   secured by the arss we currently hold 
however  the credit line provides a no cost loan where the interest rate charged on the credit line is equal to the interest rate earned on the ars 
we entered into a rights settlement whereby ubs offered to purchase certain arss it placed  including those we hold  at par or face value 
ubs has the right to purchase its arss at par at any time through july  and we have the right to sell our arss at par to ubs beginning june  through july  we have no other short or long term borrowings other than the credit line with ubs and capitalized lease agreements that would give rise to significant interest rate risk 
although our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since some portion of our investments are in money market funds  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effects of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
we do not enter into investments for speculative purposes 
although our ars investments had been designated as trading securities as of march   we expect to recover the par value of the arss based on our rights agreement with ubs 
we believe that we have sufficient available cash to execute our business plan for fiscal year as we expect the estimated level of revenues to be sufficient to generate cash from operating activities over the same period 
refer to note  caption  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments of the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our noncurrent investments 
fair value fluctuation risk at march   there was insufficient observable ars market information available to determine the fair value of our ars investments  or the put option 
therefore  in order to validate the fair value estimate of these securities  we incorporated assumptions such as credit quality or financial standing of the issuer  final stated maturities  estimates on the probability of the issue being called prior to final maturity  impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates  liquidity risk premium  and broker quotes from independent valuators using widely accepted financial models 
management believes that these are reasonable estimates reflecting the unique circumstances of the subject slars and the method of valuing the put option as forward contracts is reasonable 
the loss on fair value of the arss investment  net of gain on the fair value of the put option resulted in approximately million non cash charge during fiscal year we believe that if the assumptions that we used for ubs credit risk remain unchanged through june   we will recover this loss in future periods up to the quarter ended june  the following summarizes investments at fair value  weighted average yields and expected maturity dates for the fiscal years ended march in thousands march  march  auction rate securities  long term gross unrealized losses put option estimated fair market value weighted average yield maturity dates july  through january  july  through january  unrealized loss in income unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income unrealized gain in income foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our us operations sell products in various international markets 
during fiscal year  revenue by our german subsidiary of approximately million and net income of million was denominated in foreign currency euro 
in addition  some raw material purchases and purchased services were denominated in foreign currency 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated primarily with inter company receivables and payables  and loans receivable denominated in euros to our german subsidiary 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated for accounting purposes as hedging instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
accordingly  any gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the forward contract are reported in other income  net expenses 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset gains and losses associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated inter company receivables and payables  and loans receivable 
at march   we had a foreign exchange forward contract with a maturity of less than days to purchase million euros 
the fair value of the forward contract was not material at march
