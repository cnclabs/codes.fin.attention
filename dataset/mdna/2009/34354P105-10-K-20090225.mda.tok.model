executive overview we are an established industry leader with a strong product portfolio of pumps  valves  seals  automation and aftermarket services in support of global infrastructure industries  including oil and gas  chemical  power generation and water management  as well as general industrial markets where our products add value 
our products are integral to the movement  control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes 
our business model is influenced by the capital spending of these industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations 
the worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue  where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes 
over the past several years  we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings  as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods 
the aftermarket business  which is served by more than of our quick response centers qrcs located around the globe  provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts  service solutions  product life cycle solutions and other value added services  and is generally a higher margin business and a key component to our profitable growth 
we experienced favorable conditions in in our key industries 
the demand growth from developing markets and the optimization and refurbishment needs from mature markets increased investments in oil and gas  power and water infrastructure 
the growth of industrialization in the developing markets increased the demand for primary chemicals  which drove investment growth in chemical manufacturing facilities  particularly in asia and the middle east 
in the oil and gas industry  advancements in recovery and processing technologies created opportunities in heavy oil processing  deep water production and natural gas liquefaction and regasification  where our products are well positioned 
in the power industry  we provide products and services for all forms of power generation  and we are one of a limited number of manufacturers with existing n stamp certifications required to support the nuclear power generation industry 
the global demand growth over the past several years has provided us the opportunity to increase our installed base of new products and drive recurring aftermarket business 
we continue to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of the global market to capture this aftermarket business opportunity  as well as to secure new capital projects and process plant expansions 
although we have experienced strong demand for our products and services in recent periods  we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multinational presence  such as economic  political and other risks 
we currently employ more than  employees in more than countries who are focused on key strategies that reach across the business 
see the our strategies section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a for a discussion of our key strategies 
we continue to build on our geographic breadth through our qrc network with the goal to be positioned as near to the customers as possible for service and support in order to capture this important aftermarket business 
along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell  install and service our equipment in remote regions  it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations 
we continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products 
significant efforts are underway to improve the supply chain processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction 
in addition  we are improving our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands 
we continue to focus on improving on time delivery and quality  while reducing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations  through the assistance of a focused continuous improvement process cip initiative 
the goal of the cip initiative  which includes lean manufacturing  six sigma business management strategy and value engineering  is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on time delivery  reduced 
table of contents cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity 
this program is a key factor in our margin expansion plans 
recent disruptions in global financial markets and banking systems are making credit and capital markets more difficult for companies to access  and are generally driving up the costs of newly raised debt 
we continue to assess the implications of these factors on our current business and the state of the global economy 
while we believe that these financial market disruptions have not directly had a disproportionate impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity as of december   continuing volatility in the credit and capital markets could potentially impair our and our customers ability to access these markets and increase associated costs 
there can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by these financial market disruptions and the global economic recession as economic events and circumstances continue to evolve 
only of our term loan is due to mature in each of and  and after the effects of million of notional interest rate swaps  approximately of our term debt was at fixed rates at december  our revolving line of credit and our european letter of credit facility are committed and are held by a diversified group of financial institutions 
further  we increased our cash balance by million to million as of december  as compared with december   after significant cash uses in  including million of share repurchases  million in capital expenditures  million in dividend payments  million in contributions to our us pension plans and the funding of increased working capital requirements 
we monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis  and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a for further discussion 
business overview our company we believe that we are a world leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems 
we develop and manufacture precision engineered flow control equipment  such as pumps  valves and seals  for critical service applications that require high reliability 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this md a flowserve pump division fpd engineered and industrial pumps  pump systems  submersible motors and related services  flow control division fcd engineered and industrial valves  control valves  actuators  controls and related services  and flow solutions division fsd mechanical seals  auxiliary systems and parts and related services 
our product portfolio is built on more than well respected brand names such as worthington  idp  valtek  limitorque and durametallic  which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry 
the products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than  companies  including some of the world s leading engineering and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users 
our markets our products and services are used in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water management  and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries 
demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures depends  in turn  on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas  power and water  as well as general economic conditions 
these demands are related to the phase of the cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior 
the levels of maintenance expenditures are driven by the reliability of the equipment  planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process 

table of contents our customers include engineering contractors  original equipment manufacturers  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering contractors and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications  as are certain sales to distributors 
project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 
the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as the book and ship business  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within three months of receipt 
these orders are typically for more standard products  parts or services 
each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from a large installed base of our pumps  valves and seals  which require maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services  such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response  we believe customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  the aftermarket for standard products is competitive  as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products 
proximity of service centers  timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for aftermarket products and services 
therefore  we continue to expand our global qrc network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business 
oil and gas the oil and gas industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
investment in upstream exploration and production petroleum projects  which was driven by aggressive demand growth projections in  contributed to the increase in bookings 
many of these projects were in asia  africa  the middle east and latin america and reflect opportunities with national  international and other major oil companies 
based on the current and future expectations of oil and gas price levels as compared with historical levels  oil and gas companies are currently reevaluating capital investment plans  and several major project delays have been announced in recent weeks 
in the downstream segment refining and transportation of the industry  we experienced increased investment in due to a projected greater global demand for refined products  stimulated by the rapid economic growth in developing countries and general demand growth in the rest of the world 
these demand growth projections have been reduced in recent months due to the current and projected impact of global economic conditions 
this moderation of growth projections is influencing the timing of major refinery projects in several regions around the globe 
project investments are forecasted to continue for large developing market areas  such as china and india  as these markets continue to build indigenous capability to meet local demand 
additionally  existing refiners located in more mature markets continue to see pressure related to new clean fuel regulations and aging infrastructure  which result in activities such as overhauls and upgrades to address these concerns 
we believe these situations will continue to provide project opportunities for our products  solutions and services  which are well suited for these applications 
the outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth for crude and refined products from both mature markets and developing geographies 
we believe oil and gas companies will continue a moderate level of upstream and downstream investment through the current economic market conditions 
a prolonged decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of activity or capital spending  which could decrease demand for our products and services 
however  we believe the long term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply  projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long term demand growth 
chemical the chemical industry represented approximately of our bookings in both and the chemical industry continued its growth investment behavior through much of with the advent of the troubles in the financial markets  consumption of end products from the chemical industry began to decline in the fourth quarter of this began to impact capital spending plans at many of the major chemical companies 
recently announced 
table of contents downsizing plans by several of the major global chemical companies are also bringing measured reductions in short term capital investment plans 
the north america chemical processing industry has forecasted a focus on maintenance and upgrades of facilities to ensure the competitiveness of these operations during the current recessionary period 
we believe our qrc structure and aftermarket capabilities are well positioned to serve these demands 
in certain developing regions  such as china and the middle east  capital investment is still forecasted consistent with the indigenous growth strategies to build production capabilities to meet current and future local demands 
the outlook for the chemical industry is dependent on the global economy 
the growth behavior in this industry is well aligned with that of the gross domestic product behavior by region 
as noted above  many of the products produced by this industry depend on consumer demand to drive growth 
the significant decrease in the price of oil feedstock has the opportunity to improve the profitability of continuing operations should consumer and commodity prices hold at an acceptable level 
we believe the chemical industry will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that certain developing regions of the globe will continue investing in capital infrastructure to support both current and future local needs 
we also believe that our specialty product offerings and our aftermarket service capabilities position us to gain market share through the current economic downturn 
power the power industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
this industry continued to see capital investment growth due to the increased power demands in developing countries  such as china and india  and capacity increases in mature markets  including the united states us 
the projects in spanned all versions of power generation  including coal fired  gas fired  hydro and nuclear 
there was a concerted industry effort to review methodologies to provide clean power generation  which increased investments in carbon capture and storage  as well as alternative energy sources 
we have leveraged our research and development investments and our strong customer relationships to ensure that we are properly engaged in all matters relative to power generation 
we are seeing increased activity in alternative energy sources  such as geothermal and coal gasification  where we are working with key customers in the development of products to serve this portion of the power industry 
planned investments in nuclear power generators continued to grow in with a significant increase in proposed projects 
according to data from the world nuclear association as of the end of  there were reactors under construction with reactors planned or currently proposed 
in  china announced plans to develop an incremental gigawatts of nuclear power generation by  and the china national nuclear corporation announced they have received funding commitments of approximately billion to support this ambition 
new project plans have also been announced in india  latin america and the middle east 
our product offerings have maintained n stamp certification required for nuclear applications through the slowdown in the past in nuclear power plant construction  which has allowed us to continue to support the aftermarket business for existing facilities 
we believe this positions us well for the planned growth in investment in nuclear power generation globally 
we believe the outlook for the power industry remains favorable in the current global economic recession  however  the duration and depth of this recession could delay the demand for additional power  which could delay major capital projects into the future 
we believe the long term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on projected global population growth  advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets around the globe 
water in both and  the water market represented approximately of our bookings 
worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems  many of which require products that we offer  especially pumps 
we believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continuing investments even in the current economic downturn 
while forecasts do indicate some potential funding challenges for municipal and government projects due to 
table of contents reduced tax revenues  which are projected to potentially influence the scope of work planned  we do not currently foresee the cancellation of critical projects  as they are necessary for the availability of fresh water 
the water industry is facing a future supply demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization 
due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe  there continues to be an increased investment in desalination 
this investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next couple of decades 
we believe we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is already an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean region and the middle east 
we expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe  which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps  valves and actuation products 
general industries general industries comprises a variety of different businesses  including mining and ore processing  pharmaceuticals  pulp and paper  food and beverage and other smaller applications  none of which individually represented more than of total bookings in and general industries also include sales to distributors  whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve 
general industries represented  in the aggregate  approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
in  we saw favorable growth in these businesses during the first three quarters of the year 
with the advent of the disruptions in the global financial markets  several of these industries have experienced reduced consumption requirements for their respective end products 
pulp and paper along with mining and ore processing are two areas that have experienced measured adverse impacts from the current market conditions 
other industries in this segment are experiencing softening market conditions to a lesser extent 
we believe the outlook for this group of industries is dependent upon the length and severity of the current global economic recession 
we also believe that our specialty product offerings and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide sound business opportunities in these industries through the slower periods of the global economy 
the reporting of trends by product type  customer type and business type is based upon analytical review of individual operational results and knowledge of their respective businesses  as we do not formally track revenues by any of these categories 
these trends are analyzed as a secondary reporting mechanism that is not derived directly from our general ledger system 
our strategies our overarching objective is to grow our position as a product and integrated solutions provider in the flow control industry 
this objective includes continuing to sell products by building on existing sales relationships and marketing the power of our portfolio of products and services 
it also includes delivering specific end user solutions that help customers attain their business goals by ensuring maximum reliability at a decreased cost of ownership 
we seek to drive sustainable  profitable growth by using strategies that are well communicated throughout our company 
these strategies include organic growth  globalization  process excellence  portfolio management  strategic acquisitions  organizational capability and technology innovation 
the key elements of these strategies are outlined below 
organic growth organic growth is an important initiative focused on growing revenues from the existing portfolio of products and services  as well as through the development of new customer driven products and services 
an overarching goal is to focus on opportunities that can maximize the organic growth from existing customers and to evaluate potential new customer partnering initiatives that maximize the capture of the product s total life cycle 
we are one of the few pump  valve and seal companies that can offer customers a differentiated option of products and services  as well as offer additional options that include any combination of products and solution support packages across a broad portfolio 
the combined pump and seal end user teams have historically been successful in delivering new solution programs and increasing organic aftermarket growth 

table of contents we seek to capture additional market share by creating mutually beneficial opportunities for us and our customers through sourcing and maintenance alliance programs pursuant to which we provide all or an agreed portion of customers parts and servicing needs 
these customer alliances enable us to develop long term professional relationships with our customers and serve as an effective platform for introducing new products and services to our customers and generating additional sales 
we also seek to continue to review our substantial installed pump  seal and valve base as a means to expand the aftermarket services business  as customers are increasingly using third party aftermarket service providers to reduce their fixed costs and improve profitability 
to date  the aftermarket services business has provided us with a steady source of revenues and cash flows at higher margins than original equipment sales 
this allows us to be in frequent contact with customers  building on the knowledge of customer needs and providing cross selling opportunities 
we are building on our established presence through an extensive global qrc network to provide the immediate parts  service and technical support required to effectively manage and win the aftermarket business created from our installed base 
globalization the globalization business initiative has several facets that include expanding our global presence to capture business in the developing geographic market areas  utilizing low cost sourcing opportunities to remain competitive in the global economy  and attracting and retaining the global intellectual capital required to support our global growth plans in new geographical areas 
we believe there are attractive opportunities in international markets  particularly in latin america  the middle east and asia pacific and intend to continue to utilize our global presence and strategically invest to further penetrate these markets 
in the aftermarket services business  we seek to strategically add qrc sites in order to provide rapid response  fast delivery and onsite field repair on a global scale for our customers 
in  we added more than qrcs expanding our ability to effectively deliver aftermarket support globally 
we believe that future success will be supported by investments made to establish indigenous operations to effectively serve the local market while taking advantage of low cost manufacturing  competent engineering and strategic sourcing where practical 
we believe that this positions us well to support our global customers from project conception through commissioning and over the life of their operations 
we are focused on shifting  as appropriate  certain manufacturing and engineering functions to  and increasing the supply of materials and components from  lower cost areas such as india  china  mexico  latin america and eastern europe 
in  these low cost regions supplied our three divisions direct materials ranging from to of divisional spending 
we are also focused on utilizing supply chain management to reduce procurement costs  including expanding purchases utilizing e commerce and further consolidating the procurement of goods at a better value 
in addition  we have expanded our china presence with additional sales and supply chain professionals and growth plans 
these growth plans include acquisition or development of new capabilities that will enhance the penetration of products in china for oil and gas and power projects  as well as provide a base for the export of products 
process excellence the process excellence initiative encapsulates ongoing programs that work to drive increased customer fulfillment and yield internal productivity 
this initiative includes driving improved customer fulfillment through metrics such as on time delivery  cost reduction  quality  cycle time reduction and warranty cost reduction as a percentage of sales  continuing to develop a culture of continuous improvement that delivers maximum productivity and cost efficiencies  and implementing global functional competencies to drive standardized processes 

table of contents we seek to increase our operational efficiency through our cip initiative  which utilizes tools such as six sigma methodology  lean manufacturing and capacity management to improve quality and processes  reduce product cycle times and lower costs 
recognizing that employees are our most valuable resource in achieving operational excellence goals  we have instituted broad cip training 
to date  more than  employees are cip trained or certified as green belts  black belts or master black belts  and are deployed on cip projects throughout our company in operations and the front office of the business 
as a result of the cip initiatives  we have developed and implemented processes to reduce our engineering and manufacturing process cycle time  improve on time delivery and service response time  lower inventory levels and reduce costs 
we have also experienced success in sharing and applying best practices achieved in one business segment and deploying those ideas to other segments of the business 
we continue to rationalize existing enterprise resource planning erp systems onto six strategic erp systems 
going forward  these six strategic erp systems will be maintained as core systems with standard tool sets  and will be enhanced as needed to meet the growing needs of the business in areas such as ecommerce  back office optimization and export compliance 
further investment in non strategic erp systems will be limited to compliance matters and conversion to strategic erp systems 
we also seek to improve our working capital utilization  with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory 
see further discussion in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
portfolio management we drive our new product and service development through our product management organization  working in concert with engineering  operations and sales 
the goal is to increase our revenues from new products and services developed during the last five years 
the new product development process has made significant progress in demonstrating a pipeline of new and modified products and services 
the continued management of our portfolio of products and services is critical to our success 
we will continue to rationalize our portfolio of products and services to ensure alignment with market requirements 
we will continue to make research and development r d investments to expand the scope of our product offerings and our deployment of advanced technologies 
strategic acquisitions we continually evaluate acquisitions  joint ventures and other strategic investment opportunities to broaden our product portfolio  service capabilities  geographic presence or operational capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers 
we evaluate all investment opportunities through a decision filtering process to try to ensure a good strategic  financial and cultural fit 
in  our acquisition activities focused on the addition of complimentary products and services to key components of our existing portfolio 
these activities included the purchase of full ownership of niigata worthington company  ltd 
niigata in japan  which previously was a joint venture between our pump division and niigata 
we also completed a joint venture arrangement with the linde group for the development of its ionic compression technology  which will provide a global business in the area of clean fuel refueling technologies 
neither of the foregoing transactions were considered to have involved a significant amount of assets or to be an agreement upon which we are substantially dependent 
organizational capability we focus on several elements in our strategic efforts to continuously enhance our organizational capability  including institutionalizing our succession planning along with our leadership competencies and performance management capabilities  with a focus on key positions and critical talent pools  utilizing these capabilities to drive employee engagement through our training programs and facilitate our cross divisional and functional development assignments  
table of contents developing talent acquisition programs such as our engineering recruitment program to address critical talent needs to support our emerging markets and global growth  capturing the intellectual capital in the current workforce  disseminating it throughout our company and sharing it with customers as a competitive advantage  creating a total compensation program that provides our associates with equitable opportunities that are competitive and linked to business and individual performance  and building a diversified organization with a strong ethical and compliance culture based on transparency and trust 
we continue to focus on training through the distribution of electronic learning packages in multiple languages for our code of business conduct  workplace harassment  facility safety  anti bribery  export compliance and other regulatory and compliance programs 
in addition  in we launched a rotating equipment specialist development program aimed at capturing internal intellectual capital and improving the capabilities of the internal workforce in an effort to provide better service to our customers 
this is a comprehensive program that will continue through with the goal of educating more than  of our front line employees across the globe 
we also formalized our skilled machinist apprenticeship training program in to provide trained machinist to support our growth 
technology innovation the infusion of advanced technologies into new products and services has become a core goal as we continue to grow and evolve our product portfolio 
the objective is to improve the percentage of revenue derived from new products as a function of overall sales  utilizing technological innovation to improve overall product lifecycles and total cost of ownership for our customers 
a cross divisional technology council is in place to explore new technologies and their potential applications in our industry 
the team also has the objective of ensuring that the technologies developed are available for wide use across our company to maximize the return on investments 
we are actively involved in exploring and commercializing new technologies in five major areas materials science  fluid dynamics  mechanical design  mechatronics  and electronics and software 
as an example  one major focus of our electronics and software team is integrating self diagnostic capabilities into our products that are designed to enable pro active  condition based maintenance strategies 
this includes a series of innovations that together are able to collect in service data  intelligently analyze the data in real time to detect emerging patterns of behavior that may indicate a potential problem  and then communicate pro active advice to the end user on what actions can be taken to keep the unit in service longer and how to avoid unplanned downtime 
in many of our research areas  we are teaming with universities and experts in the appropriate scientific fields to accelerate the required learning and to shorten the development time in leveraging the value of applied technologies in our products and services 
our intent is to be a market leader in the application of advanced technology to improve product performance and return on investment for our customers

table of contents liquidity analysis recent disruptions in global financial markets and banking systems are making credit and capital markets more difficult for companies to access  and are generally driving up the costs of newly raised debt 
we continue to assess the implications of these factors on our current business and the state of the global economy 
while we believe that these financial market disruptions have not directly had a disproportionate impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity  continuing volatility in the credit and capital markets could potentially impair our and our customers ability to access these markets and increase associated costs  as well as our customers ability to pay in full and or on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by the financial market disruptions and the global economic recession as economic events and circumstances continue to evolve

we monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis  and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions 
we utilize a variety of insurance carriers for a wide range of insurance coverage and continuously monitor their creditworthiness 
based on current credit ratings by industry rating experts  we currently believe that our carriers have the ability to pay on claims 
we have experienced significant declines in the values of our us pension plan assets resulting primarily from recent declines in global equity markets  and we currently anticipate that our contribution to our us pension plan in will be between million and million

pension and postretirement benefits obligations our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit 
table of contents expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding 
plan descriptions we and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full time and part time employees 
approximately of total defined benefit pension plan assets and of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the us plan as of december  the assets for the us plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation 
unless specified otherwise  the references in this section are to total plans ie  the us plan together with international plans 
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation 
assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
at december   the estimated fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans decreased to million from million at december  assets were allocated as follows us plan us plans asset category equity securities fixed income other the projected benefit obligation benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
the estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
we amortize estimated prior service costs and estimated net loss over the remaining expected service period 
none of our common stock is directly held by these plans 
we sponsor defined benefit postretirement health care plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the us these plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies 
we fund the plans as benefits are paid  such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented 
accordingly  we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets 
the benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees 
the postretirement benefit obligation for our defined benefit postretirement health care plan was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
accrual accounting and significant assumptions consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 we account for pension benefits using the accrual method  recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees 
the accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase  and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we  in consultation with our actuaries  evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits  such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  mortality rates  retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases  and determine such assumptions as of december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year 
depending on the assumptions used  the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect benefit

table of contents as discussed below  accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees 
at december   as compared to december   we increased our discount rate for the us plan from to based on an analysis of publicly traded investment grade us corporate bonds  which had a higher yield due to current market conditions 
we decreased our average rate for non us plans from to based primarily on lower yields of investment grade corporate bonds in the united kingdom 
we increased our average assumed rate of compensation increase from to for the us plan 
we increased the expected rate of return on us plan assets from to  primarily based on our target allocations and expected long term asset returns 
we decreased our average rate of return on non us plan assets from at december  to at december  as the expected rate of return on plan assets is long term in nature  short term market changes do not significantly impact the rates 
we expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be million higher in than the million in  reflecting  among other things  the amortization of the increased actuarial net loss 
we expect the benefit for the postretirement health care plan to be million  primarily reflecting amortization of the increased actuarial net gain 
we have used discount rates of and at december   in calculating our estimated cost of pension benefits and cost of other postretirement benefits for us plans  respectively 
the assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were for  for and for  with a gradual decrease to for and future years 
if actual costs are higher than those assumed  this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care 
plan funding our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs 
we contributed million  million and million to our defined benefit plans in  and  respectively 
in  we expect to contribute between million and million to our qualified us pension plan  and we expect to contribute approximately million to our non us pension plans 
for further discussions on pension and postretirement benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
the most significant estimates made by management include timing and amount of revenue recognition  deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves  reserves for contingent losses  retirement and postretirement benefits  and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management  and management presents its views to the audit committee of our board of directors 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers  which is based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions 
in addition  our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability 
for contracts containing multiple elements  each having a determinable fair value  we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the element s pro rata share of the contract s fair value in accordance with the contractual delivery terms for each element 
freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
revenues for long term contracts  which include contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer  are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost to cost basis 
percentage of completion revenue represents less than of our consolidated sales in revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 
revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract 
these contracts can range in duration  but generally extend for up to five years 
fixed fee service contracts represent less than of our consolidated sales in in certain instances  we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts 
failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non recoverable costs 
in instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable  we perform a project profitability analysis accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues  which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project 
in such instances  we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in circumstances where the total projected reduced revenues still exceed total projected costs  the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition 
our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies 
deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries  and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could  if successful  result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate 
on january   we adopted fin no 
 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the 
table of contents position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
reserves for contingent loss liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in house experts  including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations 
the recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter  changes in political environments  legal venue and other factors 
recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties  technological innovation and regulatory environment changes 
estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed  settled and dismissed  and are included in retirement obligations and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
a substantial majority of our asbestos related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities 
estimated receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries  which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers 
estimated receivables are included in other assets  net in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in claims filed  settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense 
pension and postretirement benefits we provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees  former employees  and their beneficiaries 
the assets  liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  expected rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates  rates of compensation increases and other factors 
the assumption rates utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
these assumptions are assessed annually as of december and adjustments are made as needed 
in our review we evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained  including appropriate rates of return  interest rates and medical inflation rates 
we also compare our significant assumptions with our peers 
the methodology to set our assumptions are discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments 
for the us and the united kingdom  the discount rates are obtained from an analysis of publicly traded investment grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate for each plan 
for plans in the euro zone we use the most applicable iboxx euro corporate aa bond indices 
for other countries or regions without a corporate aa bond market  government bond rates are used 
our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long term high quality debt securities  as well as the duration of our plans liabilities 

table of contents health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data  long term health care outlook and industry benchmarks 
the inflation assumptions are based upon both our specific trends and nationally expected trends 
the expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies  expected long term performance of asset classes  risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy 
these rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions  but because they are long term in nature  short term market changes do not significantly impact the rates 
changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates 
retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience 
mortality rates are based on published actuarial tables relevant to the countries in which we have plans 
the expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels  seniority  age and other factors 
we evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations  cash flow requirements and other factors  and discuss our funding assumptions with the finance committee of our board of directors 
valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets the initial recording of goodwill and intangibles requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets 
we test the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of december each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which correlate to our operating segments 
the test of indefinite lived intangibles involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels 
impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates  which are based on our budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period 
we did not record an impairment of goodwill in  or we also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill 
although our market capitalization declined during in conjunction with the overall equity market decline  it did not decline to a level that indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill as of december  impairment losses for intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
fair values are calculated for trademarks using a relief from royalty method  which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of the royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark 
this method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that are consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above 
we did not record an impairment of our trademarks in  or the net realizable value of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  is reviewed periodically  when indicators of potential impairments are present  based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill 
additional considerations related to our long lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements  changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization 

table of contents due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting developments we have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
outlook for our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in this annual report  including this md a  involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular  the statements regarding our goals and strategies  new product introductions  plans to cultivate new businesses  future economic conditions  revenue  pricing  gross profit margin and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  research and development expenses  potential impairment of investments  tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings 
our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount  type and valuation of share based awards granted  as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover 
in addition to the various important factors discussed above  a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
see the risks described in item a 
risk factors included in this annual report 
our bookings increased in as compared with  which should translate into increased revenue in  excluding currency fluctuations 
however  as a booking represents a contract that can be modified or canceled  there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in a comparable increase in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results 
through the first days of  we had cancellations of million related to orders booked in historically  the fourth quarter has been a strong bookings quarter for us 
however  bookings in the fourth quarter of were lower than bookings in each of the first  second and third quarters of  reflecting our customers responses to concerns regarding recent disruptions in the credit and capital markets  global economic conditions and recent declines in oil and gas prices 
also  in response to global economic conditions  some customers have requested delayed shipments  which could delay the timing of our recognition of revenue anticipated to come from our backlog  or delayed project proposals  which could negatively impact our level of bookings in although we have not seen a material deterioration in our markets and we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities  we remain cautious in our outlook for given the activity levels in the fourth quarter of and the current uncertainty of global economic conditions 
for additional discussion on our markets and our opportunities therein  see the business overview our markets section of this md a 
we expect our operating income in to benefit from operational improvement programs  continuation of our end user strategy  selective contract bidding and previously implemented price increases 
a number of significant expense and certain other items could negatively impact our operating income in  which include realignment costs  selected investments in technology infrastructure to consolidate our erp systems  and higher wage and benefit costs due to inflation and share based compensation 
although we implemented price increases in and  we believe that pricing could become a more influential competitive factor in as compared with recent years 
additionally  the large proportion of original equipment business booked in by fpd may reduce gross profit margin as those products are shipped in and beyond 
as part of our continuing operational optimization strategy  we are currently evaluating our opportunities to reduce and optimize certain non strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure  and we could incur up to million in realignment costs in as a result of these activities 
all of our borrowings under our credit facilities carry a floating rate of interest 
as of december   we had million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
as a result of reducing the volatility  we may not fully benefit from a decrease in interest rates 
we expect our interest expense in will be slightly more favorable when compared with  given the lower overall interest rate environment 
however  because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest  the debt is subject to volatility in rates  which could negatively impact interest expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our business  capital expenditures  dividend payments  share repurchases  debt payments and pension plan contributions in we seek to improve our working capital utilization  with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory  and requiring progress payments from customers on long lead time projects 
however  the amount of cash generated or consumed by working capital is dependent on our level of revenues  backlog  customer acceptance and other factors 
additionally  tightening in our end markets may limit our ability to require progress payments from customers on new orders 
in  our capital expenditures will be focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets  geographic expansion  erp application upgrades  information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be approximately million  before consideration of any acquisition activity 
we have million in scheduled repayments in under our credit facilities 
we expect to comply with the covenants under our credit facilities in see the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a for further discussion of our debt covenants 
the performance of global financial markets in has reduced the value of investments held in trust to support pension plans 
additionally  us regulations are continually increasing the minimum level of funding for u 
s pension plans 
the combined impact of these changes will require us to increase our contributions to our pension plans in we currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified us pension plan will be between million and million in in order to reach fully funded status  as defined by the pension protection act  for we currently anticipate that our contributions to our non us pension plans will be approximately million in as we have discussed in this and other public filings  we are currently subject to lawsuits  internal investigations and regulatory investigations in the us and in foreign countries  which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we believe we are currently addressing these matters appropriately  and we are diligently striving to achieve the most favorable results

statements in the business outlook and other forward looking statements in this annual report are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial instruments  including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts  but we currently expect all counterparties will continue to meet their obligations given their current creditworthiness 
interest rate risk our earnings are impacted by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our credit facilities  which bear interest based on floating rates 
at december   after the effect of interest rate swaps  we had million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding under our credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate for these borrowings  assuming constant variable rate debt levels  would have changed interest expense by million for the year ended december  as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of notional amount in outstanding interest rate swaps with third parties with varying maturities through december 
table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar 
almost all of our us subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies  which are also their functional currencies 
foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and from transactions  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions  denominated in a currency other than a non us subsidiary s functional currency 
generally  we view our investments in foreign subsidiaries from a long term perspective and  therefore  do not hedge these investments 
we use capital structuring techniques to manage our investment in foreign subsidiaries as deemed necessary 
we realized net losses gains associated with foreign currency translation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which are included in other comprehensive expense income 
based on a sensitivity analysis at december   a change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december  would have impacted our net earnings by approximately million  due primarily to the euro 
this calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the us dollar and that there are no indirect effects  such as changes in non us dollar sales volumes or prices 
this calculation does not take into account the impact of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts discussed below 
we employ a foreign currency risk management strategy to minimize potential changes in cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the use of forward exchange contracts allows us to mitigate transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure
