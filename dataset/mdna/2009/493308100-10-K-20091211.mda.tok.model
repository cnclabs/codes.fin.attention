overview we offer technology based services and systems that enable enterprises to improve their mobile and online business performance and communications technologies 
we offer internet test and measurement services internet and mobile test and measurement services mobile 
our internet category includes all of our geographically distributed web site and application monitoring and measurement services  voice over ip and streaming measurement services  load testing services  customer experience management services  competitive research and industry scorecard services  and other professional services 
the mobile category consists of our on demand mobile monitoring and testing services  our global roamer services and our sigos system integrated test environment site systems 
we believe all of our services help our customers reduce costs  improve customer satisfaction and increase profitability 
we offer our internet services primarily on a subscription basis and on an engagement basis although  in some cases  we offer internet professional services on a per incident or per study basis 
we also offer the self service use of our internet technology for a fixed period of time on a subscription basis 
subscription fees range from monthly to annual commitments  and vary based on the type of service selected  the number of pages  transactions or devices monitored  the number of measurement locations and or appliances  the frequency of the measurements and any additional features ordered 
engagements typically involve fixed price contracts based on the complexity of the project  the size of a panel  and the type of testing to be conducted 
our mobile solutions are offered on a subscription basis or license basis 
the subscriptions typically are for a fixed period  usually annual  and are based on the number of locations and devices from which monitoring and testing is performed  and the number of mobile operators and services covered by such monitoring and testing 
the sigos site system  which includes software and monitoring hardware  is usually offered via a software license fee model  but because it is bundled with ongoing maintenance and support for a fixed contract period  the license fees are amortized over the length of the contract and are therefore included in ratable license revenue 
the sigos global roamer service is offered via a subscription fee model  typically for a three to twelve month period  and is included in subscription services revenue 
the following management s discussion and analysis gives effect to the corrections discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
our net income increased by approximately million  from a net loss of approximately million for the year ended september  to net income of approximately million for the year ended september  total net revenue increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  the increase in total net revenue is mainly attributable to an increase of approximately million in our ratable licenses revenue from our sigos products and services 
total costs and expenses decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  which was primarily due to strong cost containment efforts including salary 
table of contents reductions of between and across our united states based workforce  lower spending on external consultants and marketing expenses  as well as lower amortization costs of million 
we anticipate that total expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will be comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal for the year ended september   our largest customers accounted for approximately of total net revenue 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or in aggregate  will renew our services and continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that have monthly renewal arrangements may terminate their services at any time  with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer or a group of significant customers  our revenue could significantly decline 
we believe that the challenges for our business include continuing to drive growth in our internet and mobile revenue  growing multiple page broadband related revenue  such as transaction perspective and application perspective  without corresponding reductions in unit price  continuing to control our expenses in fiscal  and the challenges faced due to the current economic global downturn 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that have a significant effect on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance inventories and inventory valuation allocation of purchase price for business combinations goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  and long lived assets stock based compensation income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  fasb accounting standards codification asc formerly referenced as emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  asc formerly referenced as statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and asc formerly referenced as eitf issue  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
we generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service has occurred  fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is deemed reasonably assured 

table of contents one of the critical judgments that we make is the assessment that collectibility is probable 
our recognition of revenue is based on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable on a customer by customer basis 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash from that arrangement 
our revenue consists of subscription services revenue  ratable license revenue and professional services revenue 
subscription services revenue subscription services revenue  which is recognized in accordance with sab and asc  consists of fees from sales of subscriptions to our perspective family of services and global roamer 
we enter into multiple element arrangements where sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the allocation of revenue 
as a result  the elements within our subscription arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for fees received under subscription arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement fee as revenue either ratably over the service period  generally twelve months  or based upon actual monthly usage 
for customers that are billed the entire amount of their subscription in advance  subscription services revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months  commencing on the day service is first provided 
for customers that are billed on a monthly basis  revenue is recognized monthly based upon actual service usage for the month 
regardless of when billing occurs  we recognize revenue as services are provided and defer any revenue that is unearned 
webeffective service is sold on a subscription basis or as part of a professional services engagement 
we recognize revenue from the use of our webeffective service that is sold on a subscription basis ratably over the subscription period  commencing on the day service is first provided  and such revenue is recorded as subscription services revenue 
we recognize revenue from the use of our webeffective service as part of a professional services engagement at the time the professional services revenue is recognized and is recorded as professional services revenue 
ratable licenses revenue ratable licenses revenue consists of fees from the sale of mobile automated test equipment  software  maintenance  engineering and consulting services associated with keynote sigos site systems 
we frequently enter into multiple element arrangements with mobile customers for the sale of our automated test equipment  including both hardware and software licenses  consulting services to configure the hardware and software implementation or integration services  post contract support maintenance services  training services and other minor consulting services 
these multiple element arrangements are within the scope of asc  and asc this determination is based on the hardware component of our multiple element arrangements being deemed to be a software related element 
in addition  customers do not purchase the hardware without also purchasing the software 
in other words  the software and hardware is sold as a package with payments due from customer upon delivery of this hardware and software package 
none of the keynote sigos implementation integration services provided by us are considered to be essential to the functionality of the licensed products 
this assessment is due to the implementation integration services being performed during a relatively short period generally within two to three months compared to the length of the arrangement which typically ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
additionally  the implementation integration services are general in nature and we have a history of successfully gaining customer acceptance 
we cannot allocate the arrangement consideration to the multiple elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value since sufficient vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  typically maintenance 
therefore  we recognize the entire arrangement fee into revenue ratably over the maintenance period  historically ranging from twelve to thirty six months  once the implementation and integration services are completed  usually within two to three months following the delivery of the hardware and software 
where acceptance provisions exist in the arrangement the ratable recognition of revenue begins when evidence of customer acceptance of the software and hardware has occurred as intended under the respective arrangement s contractual terms 
professional services revenue professional services revenue consists of fees generated from our loadpro  customer experience management cem and professional consulting services that are purchased as part of a 
table of contents professional service project 
revenue from these services is recognized as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to twelve months 
for professional service projects that contain milestones  we recognize revenue once the services or milestones have been delivered  based on input measures 
payment occurs either up front or over time 
we also enter into multiple element arrangements that generally consist of either the combination of subscription and professional services or multiple professional services 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue in accordance with asc we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount associated with the undelivered items as revenue 
when sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for undelivered items when subscription and professional services are combined  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the applicable performance period 
deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance  primarily unearned license and subscription services revenue  and is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the revenue is earned 
deferred revenue is reduced to the extent that there are any accounts receivable balances associated with the deferred revenue unpaid deferred revenue at the balance sheet date and may change at any point in time based upon the timing of when invoices are collected 
short term deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that has been collected in advance that will be earned within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
correspondingly  long term deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that will be earned more than twelve months from the balance sheet date and primarily consists of keynote sigos site revenue 
we generally do not grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
free trials are occasionally provided to prospective customers who would like to try certain of our perspective and other subscription services before they commit to purchasing the services 
the services provided during the trial period are typically stand alone transactions and are not bundled with other services 
revenue is not recognized for these free trial periods 
the table below provides the details of gross deferred revenue short term and long term aggregated  unpaid deferred revenue and net deferred revenue the amount presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of september  and the addback to net deferred revenue the deferred revenue balance as recorded on the consolidated balance sheets represents the unpaid deferred revenue that has an associated accounts receivable balance as of the balance sheet dates 
the addback of unpaid deferred revenue may change at any point in time as it is based upon the timing of when invoices are collected and whether there is any deferred revenue associated with such accounts receivable 
domestic international total in thousands net deferred revenue addback unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  net deferred revenue addback unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the age of each outstanding invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review customers with invoices greater than days past due to determine whether a specific allowance is appropriate 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage  based on historical collection trends  to the outstanding accounts receivable 

table of contents billing allowance represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue and represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable and billing adjustments  including unforeseen declines in market conditions  collection rates  future recoveries and the number of billing adjustments  may result in additions to or reductions in allowances in the future 
inventories and inventory valuation inventories related to sigos site systems were approximately million as of september   and relate to direct costs associated with finished goods hardware 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
market is based on estimated replacement value 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes in future periods 
we primarily utilize current selling prices for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value is charged to direct cost of ratable licenses at the time of the market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes historical and forecasted sales 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are provided for 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions  and product life cycles 
our inventories include mainly computer hardware and mobile hardware and accessories that may be subject to technological obsolescence 
our products are sold in a competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take inventory write downs 
for the years ended september   and  we did not experience any write down of inventories 
allocation of purchase price for business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as any in process research and development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is usually determined based on management s assessment in conjunction with valuations performed by an independent third party 
such a valuation requires making significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed  and discount rates 
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates such as accruals associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles assets  and long lived assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable from the results of operations of our single reporting segment 
in addition we evaluate our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents management continually applies its judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted net cash flows used to assess recoverability of the intangible assets and the fair value of the asset group 
if future events or circumstances indicate that our estimates or the related assumptions change  an impairment assessment is required and or an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
we performed an annual goodwill review during the fourth quarter in fiscal   and we did not record an impairment charge based on our reviews 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  was approximately million as compared to million as of september  stock based compensation we issue stock options and restricted stock units to our employees and outside directors and provide our employees the right to purchase common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
since october   we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with asc under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
the value of an option is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
a change in our assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate  and thus  the total calculated costs associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock units or the issue of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail 
income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase the valuation allowance in a period  our deferred tax expense increases 
if a valuation allowance is decreased  deferred tax expense may be reduced  goodwill may be reduced  or paid in capital may be increased  depending on the nature and source of the deferred tax assets 
this analysis is applied on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
tax planning strategies may be implemented which would affect the tax rate 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we perform an analysis of our effective tax rate and we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets quarterly 
the uncertainties which could affect the realization of our deferred tax assets include various factors such as the amount of deductions for tax purposes related to our stock options  potential successful challenges to the deferred tax assets by taxing authorities  and a mismatch of the period during which the type of taxable income and the deferred tax assets are realized or a mismatch in the tax jurisdiction in which taxable income is generated and company s with the deferred tax assets 
as of october   we adopted asc formerly referenced as fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
to account for uncertain tax positions 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we 
table of contents determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
in december  we entered into an agreement whereby we purchased certain intangible assets from our german subsidiary 
this transaction was treated as an intercompany sale and  as such  tax is not recognized on the sale until we no longer benefit from the underlying asset 
therefore  during december  we recorded a long term prepaid tax asset of approximately million which represents the tax that the german subsidiary will pay of approximately million  offset by the elimination of the remaining carrying amount of the deferred tax liability related to these intangible assets that were established at the time of the acquisition of the german subsidiary 
the deferred tax liability had a carrying amount of approximately million at the time of the transfer 
we are amortizing the net prepaid tax asset of approximately million through tax expense over the life of the underlying asset which has been estimated to be months 
during the three months ended september   we recorded an additional prepaid tax asset of approximately million which represents the additional tax that the german subsidiary will pay based upon an increase in the purchase price calculated in fiscal we are amortizing the additional net prepaid tax asset of approximately million through tax expense over the remaining life of the underlying asset 
as of september   the prepaid tax asset was approximately million  net of amortization of  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the prepaid tax asset is recorded as deferred costs and other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet

subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions from our traditional perspective measurements  monitoring  testing  diagnostic  competitive research and industry scorecard services along with global roamer services 
net revenue from subscription services increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in subscription services revenue for the year ended september  was mainly attributable to increased sales of our multiple page broadband subscription services of approximately million and mobile services of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in 
table of contents our single page device subscription services of approximately million and  in our webeffective subscription services 
net revenue from subscription services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in subscription services revenue for the year ended september  over the corresponding period in fiscal was mainly attributable to increased sales of our multiple page broadband subscription services of approximately million and global roamer and other mobile subscription services of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in our single page single device subscription services of approximately million 
we measured an average of over   and  page measurements during the month of september  and  respectively 
subscription services fees can vary based on the number of pages measured  the number of devices monitored  the number of measurement locations  the number of users  the number of hours  the frequency of the measurements  the number of private agents  the additional features ordered  and the type of services purchased 
we believe that subscription services revenue may increase in the future 
however  we cannot assure you that revenue from our multiple page broadband and mobile subscription services will grow faster than any declines in our single page single device and webeffective subscription services in future periods 
ratable licenses 
net revenue from ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increases in ratable licenses revenue were mainly attributable to revenue growth from the sale of new sigos site systems and existing customers renewing maintenance agreements  offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates 
net revenue from these sales is being recognized over the maintenance period for each contract  which is typically twelve to thirty six months 
net revenue from ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to revenue growth from the sale of new sigos site systems 
we expect revenue from ratable licenses will increase in the future 
however  this growth may not be as much as experienced in fiscal year this is primarily attributable to the amount of revenue being recognized from prior periods normalizing with new sales contracts that will be amortized over twelve to thirty six months 
if the dollar weakens against the euro in the future  these revenues could also be adversely affected 
professional services 
net revenue from professional services increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in professional services revenue for the year ended september  was mainly attributable to an increase of  from our load testing and enterprise solutions engagements related to preparing websites for the holiday shopping season and other events and new customers  partially offset by a decrease of  related to our cem professional engagements 
net revenue from professional services decreased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to fewer cem engagements 
in addition to analyzing revenue for subscription services and professional services  management also internally analyzes revenue categorized as internet test and measurement internet and mobile test and measurement mobile

the cost of the test equipment as part of each new customer contract is expensed ratably over the same initial twelve to thirty six month period as the ratable licenses revenue to which it is associated 
the decrease in direct costs of ratable licenses is mainly attributable to a higher amount of revenue being recognized during the year for maintenance renewals and software upgrades that do not have any significant associated direct costs for test equipment 
direct costs of ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   and represented and of ratable licenses revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to test equipment sold as part of each new site system contract that is expensed ratably over the same initial twelve to thirty six month period as the ratable licenses revenue to which it is associated 
the decrease in direct costs of ratable licenses as a percentage of the ratable license revenue is primarily due to the fact that there was higher revenue being recognized in fiscal for maintenance renewals that do not have any significant associated direct costs 
we do not anticipate that direct costs of ratable licenses for the first quarter of fiscal will change significantly in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal direct costs of professional services

table of contents development expenses consist primarily of compensation  which includes stock based compensation  and other related costs for development personnel 
the decrease in development costs for the year ended september  was primarily due to salary reductions and lower consulting costs 
development expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of headcount throughout the year  which amounted to approximately  and to  in higher consulting expenses

our sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  approximately million of the increase was primarily related to our continued investment in sales and marketing  including an increase in personnel from in the fourth quarter of fiscal to in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the increase  to a lesser extent  was attributable to higher spending on marketing programs and events in fiscal of  and higher travel and related expenses of  due to the number of sales and marketing events 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will increase in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to incremental spending on new sales personnel and seasonal spending on marketing programs 

table of contents general and administrative change change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs  professional service fees  including accounting  auditing and legal fees  insurance  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in expenses was mainly attributable to additional personnel costs associated with additional headcount and higher consulting and professional services fees  partially offset by salary reductions 
our general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  general and administrative expenses increased by  primarily attributable to increased headcount and personnel related costs 
the increase was offset by decreased spending in professional fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal we do not anticipate that general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will change significantly in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal excess occupancy income change change in thousands rental income rental and other expenses excess occupancy income excess occupancy income consists of rental income from the leasing of space not occupied by us in our headquarters building  net of related fixed costs  such as property taxes  insurance  building depreciation  leasing broker fees and tenant improvement amortization 
the costs associated with excess occupancy income are based on the actual square footage available for lease to third parties  which was approximately for each of the years ended september  and the decrease in excess occupancy income for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  was primarily due to increased amounts of net expenses related to depreciation  property taxes and insurance 
the increase in excess occupancy income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in tenant income of approximately million due to the leasing of additional space  offset by a net increase in expenses of  we expect the excess occupancy income in the first quarter of fiscal will be comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development change change in thousands amortization of identifiable intangible assets software amortization of identifiable intangible assets other total amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets software mainly relates to developed technology related to our sigos site system and is reflected in direct costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
all other intangibles  including customer lists  are included in amortization of intangible assets other and is reflected in operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
total amortization of identifiable intangible assets decreased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in total amortization is due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in amortization associated with intangible assets purchased in the zandan acquisition that occurred in april total amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to fiscal primarily due to intangible assets purchased in the zandan acquisition 
we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
at september   we had a remaining balance of approximately million of identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a three to six and one half year expected life 
we expect the amortization of identifiable intangible assets to be approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal  assuming no additional acquisitions or impairment charges 
we expect the remaining carrying value of the identifiable intangible assets as of september   as listed in the table below  will be fully amortized by december in thousands technology technology customer based software based other based trademark covenant backlog total net carrying value at september  lease abandonment expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to an exit plan to cease using our new york facility

the lease abandonment expense of  is included in income from operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest income and other income expenses change change in thousands interest income other income expenses interest income and other income expenses  net subsequent to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september   management determined that foreign exchange losses previously presented in the consolidated statement of operations should have been classified in accumulated other comprehensive income 
consequently  corrections have been made to reduce other income expenses in the consolidated statements of operations by  to a corrected balance of  from the balance of approximately million previously reported 
interest income and other income expenses  net decreased  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  interest income decreased for the year ended september  in comparison to fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances 
other income expenses for the year ended september  increased in comparison to fiscal primarily due to more favorable foreign exchange rates in compared to interest income and other income expenses  net  decreased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in interest income and other 
table of contents income expenses  net  was primarily attributable to lower interest income from lower balance of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we believe that interest income and other income expenses  net  for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately  absent any additional transactions  and assuming no material changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and currently planned uses of cash 
provision for income taxes change change in thousands provision for income taxes for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax expense of million 
although we had a loss before income taxes for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax expense of approximately million 
for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax expense of approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately including the effect of the adjustment of the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded deferred income tax expense of approximately million associated with an increase in the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
this increase was primarily due to the net loss incurred in fiscal and our recent history of losses 
the tax rate differed from the statutory rate in each of the years primarily due to nondeductible stock based compensation charges  foreign tax differential  amortization on prepaid tax asset and the change in our valuation allowance 
we had net operating loss carryforwards at september  for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  in the tax years through in addition  we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards at september  available to reduce future taxable income for state income tax purposes 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  in the tax years through california has enacted legislation that suspends the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards for tax years and it also limits the use of business credits to of a taxpayer s tax liability for tax years and this legislation increased our tax liability for tax year and will likely increase our tax liability for tax year as of september   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal and million for state income tax purposes individually available to reduce future income taxes 
the federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in the tax year the california research credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is management s intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings indefinitely in those foreign subsidiaries 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at september  if we distribute these earnings  in the form of dividends and otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the foreign jurisdiction 
federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we have determined that the net operating losses and research and development credits acquired through the acquisition of two of our subsidiaries are subject to section limitations  and the effects of the limitations have been included in the loss and credit carryforwards 
if an additional ownership change occurs  the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced 
if we were to make additional repurchases of shares of our common stock  we could face additional limits on our use of net operating losses

cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks  money market funds and fixed term deposits with original maturities of three months or less 
as of september   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents and investments was held in the united states 
the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries 
if these cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
cash flows from operating activities we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
our largest source of operating cash flow is cash collections from our customers 
payments from subscription services customers are generally collected either at the beginning of the subscription period  ranging from one to twelve months  or monthly during the life of the subscription period 
payments for our ratable licenses are generally collected at delivery of the sigos site system 
payments from some of our professional services customers are collected at the end of the monthly service period or as milestones are completed 
our primary use of cash from operating activities  are for personnel related expenditures  measurement and data collection infrastructure costs  insurance  regulatory compliance and other expenses associated with operating our business 
comparison of years ended september  and for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
net cash provided was mainly due to net income of million adjusted for million of non cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities and a million net decrease in operating assets and liabilities 
the non cash adjustments consist primarily of depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expenses and bad debt and billing adjustment reserves 
the net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately million  and an increase in prepaid and other assets  including prepaid tax assets  of million  partially offset by a decrease in account receivable of million 
the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses during the year ended september  was 
table of contents mainly attributed to tax payments to the german authorities for taxes associated with prior operations and an ip migration strategy that occurred in comparison of years ended september  and for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million which was primarily due to a net loss of million  adjusted for all non cash amortization  depreciation and stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was offset by cash used in operating activities due to an increase of approximately million in accounts receivable and a decrease of approximately million in deferred revenue 
the increase in accounts receivable was mainly attributable to higher dso in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in deferred revenue is mainly attributable to increased number of itm customers that are now being billed on a month to month basis in arrears rather than being billed in advance 
cash flows from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relates to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of investments 
we also use cash to invest in equipment and other assets to support our growth and infrastructure 
comparison of years ended september  and for the year ended september   net cash used by our investing activities was approximately million 
we paid approximately million for the purchase of short term investments  and received approximately million from maturities and sales of short term investments 
we also utilized million to purchase property  equipment  and software primarily for our production infrastructure  information systems  and tenant improvements associated with space that we have leased in our headquarters building 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from investing activities increased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to the net sales of short term investments of million  offset by million of purchases of property and equipment  acquired technology  and the purchase of businesses and assets  net 
cash flows from financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to payments made for stock repurchases and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from financing activities increased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan of approximately million 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from financing activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to repurchases of our common stock in fiscal we utilized approximately million and million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market during the years ended september  and  respectively 
we received approximately million and million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan for the years ended september  and  respectively 

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations as of september   our principal commitments consisted of approximately million in real property operating leases and equipment capital and operating leases  with various lease terms  the longest of which expires in october additionally  we had contingent commitments  ranging in length from one to twenty nine months  to bandwidth and collocation providers amounting to approximately million  which commitments become due if we terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
at present  we do not intend to terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
we expect to continue to invest in equipment and other assets to support our growth 
the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations capital leases contractual obligations operating leases contingent commitments bandwidth and co location total the above amounts exclude liabilities under asc  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement 
as of september   we have outstanding guarantees to customers and vendors totaling  in one of our foreign subsidiaries 
the guarantees can only be executed upon agreement by both the customer or vendor and us 
the guarantees are secured by an unsecured line of credit of approximately million that has not been drawn upon as of september  we generally do not indemnify customers for our measuring  monitoring and testing web based applications against legal claims that our products and services infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by us may include indemnification provisions that we could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against us or an indemnified third party 
however  we have never been a party to an infringement claim and in the opinion of management  we do not have a liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification and as such  there is no material adverse affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
factors that could affect our cash position include potential acquisitions  decreases in customers or renewals  decreases in revenue or changes in the value of our short term investments 
if  after some period of time  cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our business may be harmed 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not enter into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in a unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we have not and currently do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels at september   the interest earned on those cash  cash equivalents and short term investments could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis 
foreign currency fluctuations 
a substantial majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the euro and british pound 
we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
revenues derived from customers outside of the united states  which are billed from our headquarters  in san mateo  ca  and have the us dollar as the functional currency  are collected in foreign currencies 
revenues derived from customers outside of the united states  which are billed from our nuremberg  germany office  are typically billed in euros 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our international subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in interest and other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  primarily due to fluctuations in the euro and the british pound  totaled   and  for the years ended september     respectively
