executive level overview active power is a manufacturer and provider of critical power solutions incorporating ups systems that provide business continuity to enterprises requiring protection against electrical power disturbances 
our products are designed to deliver continuous clean power  protecting customers from voltage fluctuations  such as surges and sags  and frequency fluctuations  and also to provide ride through  or temporary  power to bridge the gap between a power outage and the restoration of utility power 
our target customers are those global enterprises requiring power insurance because they have zero tolerance for downtime in their mission critical operations 
the ups products we manufacture utilize green technology to create a renewable energy source 
these products are highly reliable  are energy and space efficient  and significantly reduce client electricity expenses 
as of december   we have shipped more than  flywheels in ups system installations  delivering more than megawatts of power to customers in more than countries around the world 
we are headquartered in austin  texas  with international offices in the uk  germany and japan 
our primary sales channels in north america have traditionally been through our oem partners  caterpillar  inc and eaton electrical formerly known as powerware 
since  we have developed additional sales channels in north america including direct sales employees and a network of manufacturer s representatives 
direct sales tend to improve our relationships with clients  improve our gross margins and add service and other revenue opportunities 
our direct sales channel contributed  and of our revenues during  and  respectively 
our primary sales channels in europe  middle east and africa emea and asia include selling directly to end users and indirectly through select value added resellers and distributors 
we also provide services including engineering  installation  start up  monitoring  and repair for our products under contracts with our customers 
total revenue in increased from due to continuing and increased market acceptance of our flywheel based products  especially our kva product line 
we achieved strong growth in both of our primary markets of north america  emea and asia 
we believe revenues will continue to grow in from new product sales as we become more systems focused 
in particular  we expect higher sales volume of our megawatt class ups products  and of additional variations of our flywheel based products  including containerized versions such as our powerhouse product  that we intend to sell in to industrial manufacturers and it customers globally 
we believe that the investments we made during and in our sales organization to increase our level of direct sales staff  particularly in europe and north america  will contribute to improve sales results in our revenue derived from customers located outside of the united states was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during  in an effort to expand the territories in which we sell our active power branded products  we continued to increase our direct sales organization and add new distribution arrangements  particularly in emea 
revenues in emea and asia increased by in as a result of these efforts and we 
table of contents anticipate higher sales levels from this region in in  we also opened a sales office in japan and began selling directly in the asia pacific area 
this is still a small part of our total foreign sales  and our revenues in asia increased by in from levels 
sales of active power branded products through our direct sales and manufacturers representative channels were   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we were able to improve our gross profit in and for the third consecutive year report a positive gross margin 
our gross profit margin  before an impairment charge for coolair inventory of million that we made during  was 
after this charge  our reported gross profit margin was  which represents an improvement from the we achieved in and the in during our fourth quarter of we recorded a gross profit margin of  which was our highest to date 
this improvement was due primarily to higher sales volumes  higher direct sales  and higher product pricing 
direct sales typically generate higher margins for us than sales that are made through our distribution channels 
our operating losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
excluding the coolair related inventory impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively  we were able to reduce our operating losses by million  or  in after having reduced them in from this is primarily due to the gross margin improvements offset slightly by higher sales and marketing expenses due to the increase in our sales organization and lower operating expenses in development and administration 
non cash stock based compensation expense included in the operating losses was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we recorded an ebitda loss of million in  compared to an ebitda loss of million in this reduction of million  or  was attributable to our higher revenue levels  higher gross profit margins and lower cash operating expenses 
our adjusted ebitda  which is ebitda less stock based compensation expense  is a measure we use to approximate cash used in operations and to facilitate comparisons with our competitors 
adjusted ebitda for was a loss of million  compared to a loss of million in  a decrease of 
in the fourth quarter of our adjusted ebitda was a positive  this was the first time that we have achieved a positive adjusted ebitda result 
net cash used in operations increased slightly in to million  compared to million in  despite the lower operating losses 
this was primarily due to the additional investments that we made in working capital to finance the continued growth of the business  particularly in higher receivables and lower deferred revenues 
we were able to offset this use of cash by lowering our levels of inventory and increasing payables 
we also drew down million against our bank revolving line of credit facility during to help finance these working capital requirements 
we have a history of operating losses and have not yet reached operating profitability 
we believe that the success of our flywheel products and our new product developments combined with our focus on direct sales and solution selling to customers will help us to reduce our level of operating losses and the amount of cash that we consume in our operations 
this is exemplified by the improvement in net cash used in operations in the second half of  which was million  compared to million in the first half of this improvement was driven by higher sales volume and lower operating losses 
however  we do expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several quarters and for this will continue to consume our cash and investments 
our total cash and investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  due to the improvements in our operations in the second half of we believe that our cash and investments are sufficient to meet our operational needs for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate  and 
table of contents changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to the customer s potential insolvency 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with certain customers 
the assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  risks unique to particular geographic regions  historical experience and existing economic conditions 
historically  a large portion of our sales have been made through oem channels to a few large customers  and so our credit losses have been minimal 
as we integrate additional distribution channels into our business and increase our direct sales to more and smaller customers  the risk of credit loss may increase 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we estimate inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions  inventory turns and specific identification of items  such as product discontinuance  damaged goods or engineering material changes 
accrued warranty liability the estimated warranty liability costs are accrued for each of our products at the time of sale 
our estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product  including where little or no claims experience may exist 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates  changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results 
our estimate of warranty liability is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures  therefore our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
the resulting balances are then compared to current spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
revenue recognition in general  revenue for product sales is recognized when title has transferred to the customer as stipulated by the delivery terms in a sales contract 
in addition  prior to revenue recognition we require persuasive written evidence of the arrangement  a fixed or determinable price  and a determination that collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents we also offer various services to customers depending on the type of product the customer has purchased  which may include on site services or installation and integration services 
such services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
revenue for services is recognized at the time services are provided 
when products and services are contracted under a single arrangement  we allocate the total sales price to the multiple deliverables based on their relative fair values 
the fair value of our equipment is based on our average historical selling prices  while the fair value of services is based upon the rates that we charge customers in separately negotiated transactions or based on the market price an independent third party would charge to provide these services 
revenue associated with the sale of extended warranties is recognized ratably over the contract period 
stock based compensation beginning in we adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective application method and began accounting for our stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time 
a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
through  we accounted for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma income and per share data as if a fair value method had been used to account for stock based compensation 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to product revenue product revenue primarily consists of sales of our cleansource power quality products  comprising both ups and dc product lines  and sales of continuous power systems cps which are comprised of our ups systems and some combination of third party ancillary equipment  such as engine generators and switchgear 
the cps products may be sold in a containerized solution or as separate equipment 
product revenue also includes sales of our coolair dc product and coolair ups products 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in product revenue from was due to million in increased sales of our kva product line  million in increased sales of our megawatt class product line  as well as million in increased sales of ancillary equipment that we sold to customers along with our ups products 
these increases were offset by a decrease in sales of our dc product line  kva product line and coolair product line  of million  million and million  respectively  from the decrease in sales of those product lines was the result of decreased emphasis and channel development of the dc product line compared to our ups products and a decreased emphasis on sales in the other product lines as we have concentrated on our ups sales 
in  we sold flywheel product units  a increase over the units that we sold in the average sales price per flywheel increased by to approximately  in from approximately  in the increase in average selling price is due to price increases  the product mix and proportionately more wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
our direct sales channel typically has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
we expect this trend in mix and average selling price to continue 
the frequency and timing of our larger system sales  including megawatt class ups products and our containerized products  is more volatile and can result in material changes in period to period revenue 
such revenues also can occur in periods other than when originally anticipated  which can add to the potential volatility and affect our ability to meet forecasted targets 
larger system sales may also involve higher amounts of ancillary products upon which we typically generate lower profits when compared to sale of our ups products only 
therefore  a significant increase in product revenues that was caused by higher sales of ancillary products may not result in a commensurate increase in our gross or operating profit levels 
north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for we continued to expand the sales territories where we sell our active power branded products in  as we increased our sales distribution capabilities  particularly in europe and asia 
we also increased the size of our sales and service organization in the uk and europe 
we anticipate higher revenues from these locations in as a result 
sales to caterpillar represented of our revenue in as compared to of our revenue in and caterpillar remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
our revenue from caterpillar increased by in this increase was driven by a number of large sales of our megawatt class ups products through this channel 
we expect further growth in sales to caterpillar in as they enjoy success with their large engine generators  particularly in the megawatt and larger power applications 
we also have seen and anticipate a further increase in capital spending in datacenters where there is a requirement for higher density power solutions such as flywheels 
we believe that we may be able to capitalize on this trend 

table of contents our products perform well in harsh environments where power quality or reliability is particularly poor  which makes them a good fit for countries with a poor power infrastructure or in harsh manufacturing or process environments  or situations where reliability is paramount  such as mission critical business applications 
therefore we have traditionally focused our direct sales efforts to these types of customer situations 
due to the large size of some of our customer orders relative to our current total revenue levels  our quarterly total revenue trend and the proportion of sales made directly by us can be expected to fluctuate 
service and other revenue service and other revenue primarily relates to revenue generated from both traditional after market service work and from customer specific system engineering 
this includes revenue from design  installation  startup  repairs or reconfigurations of our products and the sale of spare or replacement parts to our oem and end user customers 
it also includes revenue associated with the costs of travel of our service personnel and revenues or fees received upon contract deferment or cancellation 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in our installed base of customers  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  is driving the trend of higher service and spares revenue 
our service and other revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
we also recorded million of fees related to contract cancellation in by one customer 
we anticipate that service and other revenue will continue to grow as our product revenue increases and as our installed base of product expands because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
where sales are made through an oem channel  our oem partner would typically provide these services to their end user customers 
thus  increasing direct sales gives us a greater opportunity to grow our service and other revenue 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of component parts of our products or ancillary equipment that are sourced from external suppliers  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with our assembly and test operations including costs from having underutilized facilities  shipping costs  warranty costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our cost of product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase in cost of product revenue was driven by the increase in product revenues that we experienced in the cost of product revenue did not increase at the same rate as product revenue  as we had lower product costs reflecting the results of product cost reduction programs we have implemented 
the cost of product revenue also included a million charge for excess inventory and impairment of manufacturing assets related to our coolair product family that was based on the then current assessment of product demand for coolair 
in september  we recorded an additional reserve of million against the coolair inventory as a result of our further diminished expectations of future product demand that potentially would result in excess quantities of coolair inventory 
net of current product sales backlog and future spares and support requirements  the coolair inventory value was reduced to its salvageable value 

table of contents we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sell as well as by lowering our product cost 
as a result  our product revenue increased more than the increase in the cost of product revenue 
this has been part of our strategy to improve the profitability of individual transactions and the profitability of the company as a whole 
we believe that as our direct sales and our total revenues continue to increase  our product margins will improve 
in  we increased sales of higher margin product options and features with the ups systems we sold  which lead to a further increase in our average selling price 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility  which has a large portion of fixed costs 
we incur approximately million per year in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility that has a capacity in excess of our current business requirements 
we expense the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
we now produce more goods with less overhead than in previous years 
some of this efficiency is driven by higher product volumes that allow for better utilization of our test facility and our manufacturing space 
we also have ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  to reduce our absolute level of overhead spending and headcount  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
during these efforts have helped reduce our cost of product revenue in spite of the pressures of higher raw material and commodity price increases 
for we anticipate further cost reductions from these ongoing programs 
cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue includes the cost of component parts that we use in service or sell as spare parts to customers  as well as the labor and overhead costs of our service organization  including travel and related costs incurred in fulfilling our service obligations to our customers 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our cost of service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase of in the cost of service and other revenue in is driven by the increase in service and other revenue 
the increase also reflects the higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities around the world 
as our direct sales organization has expanded we have added service and technical personnel  including in many foreign markets  in order to support our selling efforts and to meet our customer responsibilities 
balancing our labor requirements to our customer needs will continue to be a business challenge for our service organization in  as we seek to ensure that we do not incur additional fixed labor costs in advance of anticipated service revenues 
achieving the efficient utilization of our service labor will be key to profitably growing this area of our business 
many of the costs of the service organization are fixed in nature  and higher volume of installation  startup and service work is resulting in improved efficiency and operating results for this group 
we expect this trend to continue in 
table of contents research and development research and development expense primarily consists of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  third party consulting and development activities  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology under development  as well as enhancements to our megawatt class ups products and refinement of our containerized product solutions 
the decrease in spending compared to is primarily a result of lower headcount 
the expense included approximately million of stock based compensation 
we believe that research and development expenses will remain at current levels in although this will represent a smaller percentage of our total revenue  and that the spending will be focused on enhancements and cost reductions to our flywheel products 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses primarily comprise compensation and related costs for selling and marketing personnel  and related travel  selling and marketing expenses  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling and marketing expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in selling and marketing expenses in largely reflects higher variable compensation that was paid to our sales employees on higher revenue levels 
although the total headcount has not changed significantly since  we have changed the composition of our sales organization from supporting oem partners to supporting more direct selling 
we have also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrate on developing and improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
the expense also includes approximately million of stock based compensation 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in but reduce as a percentage of revenues as we expand our direct sales force into new geographies and due to higher variable compensation as our revenues continue to increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees  taxes  and the allowance for doubtful accounts expense 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change 
table of contents the decrease in general and administrative expense from to was primarily attributable to the absence of million in expenses incurred in related to an investigation into our historical stock option granting procedures that resulted in restatement of prior year financials 
we are currently in the process of negotiating to settle outstanding tax matters resulting from the option investigation with the internal revenue service and do not anticipate any further expenses from this investigation 
we anticipate that the level of general and administrative expenses in should remain at similar absolute levels to those in interest income the following table summarizes the yearly changes in our interest income in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the decrease in interest income from to is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that we had for investment as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves and to the decline in interest rates during during the year  as part of our investment strategy  we moved more investments into short term instruments in reaction to the declining interest rate environment 
we expect interest income to fluctuate depending on cash and investment balances and trends in interest rates 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carryforwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carryforward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities 
however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carryforwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
comparison of to product revenue product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in product revenue from was due to million in increased sales of our kva product lines  as well as million in increased sales of ancillary equipment that we sold along with our ups products and million from increased coolair sales 
this was offset by a decrease in sales of our kva products of million from in  we sold flywheel product units  a decrease over the units that we sold in this decrease in volume was offset by an increase in average sales price per kva flywheel by to approximately  in from approximately  in the increase in average selling price was due to price increases and proportionately more wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
north america sales were of our total revenue for compared to for we continued to expand the sales territories in which our active power branded products are sold in as we increased our direct sales organization  particularly in europe and asia 
we opened new offices in japan during the year as part of this effort 
we also increased the size of our sales and service organization in the uk and europe 
caterpillar represented of our revenues in as compared to of our revenue in and remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
our revenue from caterpillar increased by in  
table of contents however this increase was smaller than the increase in our direct business in compared to as a result  caterpillar represented a smaller portion of our total revenue in in  we began to offer our coolair dc product for commercial sale 
sales of this new technology reached million in service and other revenue the increase in our installed base of customers from to  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  contributed to higher service and other revenue in our service and other revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
cost of product revenue the increase in cost of product revenue in was driven by the increase in product revenues that we experienced in during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our level of coolair inventory compared to our historic and projected product demand and in light of planned future development efforts for the tacas technology as we migrate a dc only product into a more compelling customer solution with increased capability and marketability 
as a result of this review we reserved million for excess inventory charges and recorded a million impairment charge against specific coolair manufacturing assets 
our gross product margins improved in when compared to as a result of increases in the average selling price of our products that we sell 
as a result  our product revenue increased more than the increase in the cost of product revenue 
this has been part of our strategy to improve the profitability of individual transactions and the profitability of the company as a whole 
we achieved a positive gross margin for the company for the first time in  and with higher product volume and higher product pricing in  we were able to improve our positive gross margin in to 
in  we increased sales of higher margin product options and features with the ups systems we sold  which lead to a further increase in our average selling price 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility  which has a large portion of fixed costs 
these benefits have been mitigated during by higher raw material and commodity price increases  but have allowed us to maintain prices despite the higher incoming costs of materials 
cost of service and other revenue the increase of in the cost of service and other revenue in is driven by the increase in service and other revenue 
the increase also reflects the higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities around the world 
as our direct sales organization has expanded we have added service and technical personnel  including in many foreign markets  in order to support our selling efforts and to meet our customer responsibilities 
this increase in costs compares to the increase in service and other revenue that we achieved in research and development our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology under development  as well as enhancements to our megawatt class ups products 
the decrease in spending compared to is a result of significantly lower prototype expenses with the coolair product development as it neared production  and from lower salary expenses following a reduction in headcount that we made in the third quarter of this research and development expense included approximately  of stock based compensation 

table of contents selling and marketing the increase in selling and marketing expenses in reflects the higher headcount and related costs as we have expanded our direct sales force in emea and north america and from higher variable compensation as our total revenues increase 
although the total headcount has not changed significantly  we have changed the composition of our sales organization from supporting oem partners to one supporting more direct selling during we have also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrate on improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
the expense also includes approximately million of stock based compensation 
general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expense from to was primarily attributable to million in expenses related to an investigation into our historical stock option granting procedures that resulted in restatement of prior year financial statements 
absent these expenses  our general and administrative expenses would have been lower than  reflecting our efforts to control costs and headcount and the resolution of our prior legal issues resulting in lower legal expenses 
litigation settlement expense in november  we reached a settlement of the litigation with greenwich insurance company whereby greenwich agreed to pay us million in exchange for a full settlement of this case 
accordingly  after million was paid to our former chairman and ceo  pursuant to the reimbursement agreement  we received gross proceeds of million 
interest income the decrease in interest income from to is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that we had for investment as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves 
during the year  as part of our investment strategy  we moved more investments into short term instruments in reaction to the declining interest rate environment 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity at december  are our cash and investments on hand  our bank credit facilities and projected cash flows from operating activities 
if we meet our cash flow projections in our current business plan  we expect that we will not require additional financing in order to continue operating and growing our business during our business plan and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected revenues and future costs 
however  there are scenarios in which our revenues may not meet our projections or our costs may exceed our estimates 
further  our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates 
any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in or significantly affect our level of liquidity  which may require us to seek additional financing or take other measures to reduce our operating costs in order to continue operating 
our cash and investments at december  totaled million 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or 
table of contents equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb 
the loan agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit in an amount of up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula 
in we modified the loan agreement to provide for a us export import credit facility that would add a us government guarantee to the payments for these foreign shipments and make more of our foreign shipments eligible as security for the credit facility 
prior to this modification  export revenues were not eligible to be included as part of the borrowing base  which may have limited our ability to utilize the revolving credit facility 
all amounts borrowed under this facility are subject to a borrowing base formula based on eligible receivables and inventory 
during the year ended december   we borrowed million under this credit facility and this balance remained outstanding at december  based on the borrowing base formula  we had an additional million available for use at december  under this credit facility 
the loan agreement requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of unrestricted cash to the outstanding amounts under the loan agreement of at least to in addition  the loan agreement contains customary affirmative covenants  including covenants that require  among other things  the delivery of financial statements  compliance with laws  the maintenance of insurance and the protection and registration of intellectual property rights 
further  the loan agreement contains customary negative covenants  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  dispose of assets  change our business  change our ceo or cfo  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  make distributions  repurchase stock  and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type 
revolving loans under this credit facility may be borrowed  repaid and re borrowed until october   at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid and all outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized 
revolving loans bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of svb s prime rate plus or 
a default interest rate shall apply during an event of default at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
the revolving loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  provided that such security interest is limited to no more than of the outstanding capital stock held by us of each of our subsidiaries 
significant uses of cash operating activities the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash used in operating activities in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change cash used in operating activities in was million  compared to million in  an increase of  or million  despite a million reduction in operating loss in this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities  or our working capital  resulting in cash used of million in  compared to cash provided of million in in  we 
table of contents had a significant increase in receivables of million compared to the prior year  attributable to the higher revenues we achieved in  with an increase in our fourth quarter sales of compared to the fourth quarter of receivables at december  were higher than at the end of we were able to offset this increase in higher receivables with a million decrease in our inventory in  as we shipped more products at the end of the year and were more efficient in our manufacturing operations 
our deferred revenue customer deposits and advance payments balance decreased by million as compared to we have not had any material change in the payment cycles for our payables or for our collections in despite a challenging external environment but will be monitoring this closely in we do continue to request deposits and periodic payments from large customers where commercially possible  particularly for projects with multiple deliverables 
however  the amount of such advance payments can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  depending on the size and scope of customer orders at any point in time 
having now grown our quarterly revenues to over million in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate cash used in operating activities for will decrease from the level in having made the necessary investments in inventory and receivables  we believe that we can fund further increases in revenues without having to make significantly more investments in funding working capital 
net cash used in operations decreased from million in the first half of to million in the second half of this marked improvement was the result of an increase in sales volume 
this was after consuming million in net cash used in operations in the first half of on lower sales volume 
we also anticipate further reductions in operating losses in which will also alleviate and reduce the cash that we use in operations 
we used million of cash in funding our operating activities during  which was million  or  lower than the million used in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating losses  non cash impairment charges expensed in  lower levels of stock based compensation  and better working capital management as reflected in a decrease in outstanding accounts receivable  and higher deferred revenue from maintenance contracts and customer deposits 
these were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable as we paid for the expenses of our historical stock option review and higher inventory levels 
investing activities investing activities primarily consist of sales and purchases of investments and purchases of property and equipment 
fluctuations in the sale and purchase of investments generally reflect our use of these investment funds to finance our ongoing operations 
overall  the cash provided from investing activities remained at million in  the same level as in capital expenditures were approximately million in both and  increasing less than million in as compared to this increase was primarily due to investments in our infrastructure to support increased growth  including the upgrade of our current erp system and equipment for demonstration and sales offices globally 
financing activities funds provided by financing activities during were million  which reflects the amount that we borrowed from svb in under our revolving credit facility 
the funds from financing activities in of million reflected the net proceeds we received from a private placement of our common stock in august we have not sold any equity securities since that transaction 
we do not anticipate any new financing from the sale of equities at this time 
we are considering further borrowings  including an equipment financing facility  for to help finance certain property and equipment purchases that are planned for  but we have not yet entered into any borrowing arrangements 
to the extent possible  we may further draw down on our credit facility during to preserve our cash and investments 
contractual commitments in our day to day operations  we incur commitments to make future payments for goods and services 
these arise from entering into operating leases and as we make commitments to vendors to provide us materials and 
table of contents services 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands and thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations our principal lease commitments consist of our lease for our corporate headquarters and engineering facilities and our global sales offices 
in  we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility of up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  with svb 
there was million and outstanding under this facility at december  and  respectively 
future uses of cash we believe that our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months we have prepared multiple scenarios for anticipated revenues in  both favorable and unfavorable  to reflect a high level of uncertainty about the future macroeconomic environment in which we operate our business 
our sales cycle is such that we have visibility quarters in advance into future orders that allows us to predict revenues over this period of time with some degree of confidence 
this window also provides us with some opportunity to adjust expenditures or take other measures to reduce our cash consumption if we can see and anticipate a shortfall in revenues 
based on the different scenarios we modeled for  we believe that we can continue to manage operations and manage our working capital with the cash and investments that we have on hand as at december  without the need for a further capital raise 
we expect the level of capital investments to remain similar in to those in we currently intend to invest in several powerhouse systems to use for demonstration purposes in the us and in the us to help our sales efforts  but are not planning any other major capital investments 
we still have outstanding liabilities for tax obligations from the stock option investigation that we expensed in but that will be paid in beyond the next twelve months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the market acceptance of our products  the gross profit we are able to generate with our sales  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or merger  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
other factors that may affect liquidity as noted above  we believe our existing cash and investments balances at december  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next months 
beyond the next months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the success of our direct selling strategy  the continued market acceptance of our products  including in particular the powerhouse product family  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the efficiency of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of 
table of contents principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  sfas is amended by fsp fas  application of fasb statement to fasb statement and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement  which excludes from the scope of this provision arrangements accounted for under sfas  accounting for leases 
sfas is also amended by fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
in october  sfas was amended again by fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the fsp is effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we adopted sfas on january   except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we also adopted fsp on september  as required and concluded it did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which establishes the acquisition method to account for business combinations 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
these rules will be effective for transactions closing after january  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national government entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of investments that we allow and in terms of the credit quality of the investments we hold 
we estimate that a decrease in market interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by approximately million 
because of the nature of the majority of our investments  we do not believe a decline in interest rates would have a material effect on their fair value 
our international sales have historically been made in us dollars 
as we have increased sales in foreign markets and opened operations in multiple foreign countries  we have executed more transactions that are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro and british pounds 
those sales and expenses in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses which have not been significant to date 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations other than an increasing amount of sales and support expenses being incurred in foreign currencies as a natural hedge 
however  recent volatility in currencies  particularly with the pound and euro  is increasing the amount of potential translation gains and losses and we may engage in hedging activities in the future to mitigate the risks caused by such currency volatility 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item a  risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by the actual occurrence of any of these or other risks
