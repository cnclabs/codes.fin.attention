item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights we continued to experience a difficult economic environment in fiscal we believe the deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets have adversely impacted consumer disposable income and consumer spending patterns  which in turn is impacting our industry 
our industry has experienced volatile fuel prices and food costs  and our customers have experienced lower traffic from their customers 
food cost inflation  which we began to experience at high levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal and which prevailed through the first half of fiscal  moderated in the second half of fiscal these factors negatively impacted sales and operating income in fiscal and fiscal the decline in the financial markets had an additional impact on our operating income because sysco invests in life insurance policies in order to provide for certain retirement programs 
the value of our investments in corporate owned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments  which include publicly traded securities 
due to the decline in the financial markets  we have experienced losses in the cash surrender values of these policies  which has reduced operating income 
sales decreased in fiscal over the comparable prior year period to  primarily due to deteriorating economic conditions and the resulting impact on consumer spending 
inflation  as measured by product cost increases  was an estimated during fiscal operating income decreased to  or of sales  a decrease over the prior year 
our operating companies have continued to manage their businesses effectively in a difficult environment  which is demonstrated by the fact that the decrease in operating income was less than the decrease in sales 
basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal were both  a decrease of and  respectively  from the comparable prior year period 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted by accruals for tax contingencies and the non deductibility of the losses recorded on corporate owned life insurance 
operating income for fiscal was negatively impacted by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables 
the negative impact of these additional expenses was more than offset by lower pay related expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies 
in addition  our fuel costs increased in fiscal  driven by higher contracted fuel prices as compared to fiscal we partially offset the impact of these higher fuel costs through fuel usage reduction measures and fuel surcharges 
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
our operations are primarily located throughout the united states  canada and ireland and include broadline companies  specialty produce companies  custom cut meat operations  hotel supply operations  sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary and a company that distributes to international customers 
we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about of this approximately billion annual market 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food away from home  market represents approximately of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states 
this share grew from about in to nearly in and did not change materially until when it declined to the current level of 
industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales decline of approximately in calendar year and real sales growth of in calendar year real sales growth and declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  are contributing to a decline in the foodservice market 
historically  we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry 
we intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth  margin management  productivity gains and supply chain management 

table of contents strategy we intend to continue to expand our market share and grow earnings through strategies which include sales growth we intend to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products purchased by existing customers  development of new customers  the use of foldouts new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other sysco operating companies  investment in new technologies and a disciplined acquisition program 
our business review program  which is designed to help our customers grow their business  and the size and expertise of our sales force are key factors in maintaining and growing sales 
lowering procurement costs we intend to lower our cost of goods sold by leveraging sysco s purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an end to end view of our supply chain 
our national supply chain initiative is focused on lowering inventory  inbound freight  product costs  operating costs  working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at our operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers 
a component of our national supply chain initiative is the use of redistribution centers rdcs which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all sysco broadline operating companies in a geographic region 
we currently have two rdcs located in virginia and florida and have purchased the land for a third rdc in indiana 
productivity gains we intend to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation and manage energy consumption to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers 
enhanced technology platform during fiscal  we commenced the design of an enterprise wide project to implement an integrated software system to support the majority of our business processes 
the goal of the project is to create a new technology platform that simplifies and standardizes our business model  which we believe will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations 
we will continue to use our strategies to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy  handle and market products for our customers 
our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in north america  however  we will continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities in other markets 
as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses

we believe we will continue to experience a difficult economic environment into fiscal thus far in fiscal  we have experienced moderate deflation 
both of these conditions will make it challenging to grow sales in fiscal  however  if underlying economic conditions improve during fiscal  we believe our trend of sequential quarterly sales decline may reverse 
we believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities  investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthening customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers 
we also believe these activities help our customers in this difficult economic environment 
operating income cost of sales primarily includes product costs  net of vendor consideration and in bound freight 
operating expenses include the costs of facilities  product handling  delivery  selling and general and administrative activities 
operating income decreased in fiscal from fiscal to  or of sales 
operating income declined primarily due to a decline in sales  partially offset by a decline in operating expenses 
gross margin dollars decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and operating expenses decreased in fiscal operating income increased in fiscal over fiscal to  or of sales 
operating income increased primarily due to an increase in sales  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
gross margin dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and operating expenses increased in fiscal 
table of contents beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sysco began experiencing high levels of product cost increases in numerous product categories 
these increases persisted throughout fiscal at levels approximating and rose even higher to in the first weeks of fiscal the level of product cost increases began moderating during the third quarter of fiscal and was in the fourth quarter of fiscal generally  sysco attempts to pass increased costs to its customers  however  because of contractual and competitive reasons  we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately 
prolonged periods of high inflation  such as those we have recently experienced  have a negative impact on our customers  as high food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the food prepared away from home market 
as a result  these factors may negatively impact our sales  gross margins and earnings 
we may also be negatively impacted by periods of prolonged product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup 
as a result  our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation  even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
we believe the operating expense performance for fiscal compared to fiscal was aided by operating efficiencies and lower payroll expense related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation 
the positive impact of these expense reductions was partially offset by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables 
in addition  our fuel costs increased during fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal were negatively impacted by the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and increased provisions related to multi employer pension plans 
the negative impact of these expense increases was partially offset by lower share based compensation expense and lower company sponsored pension expenses 
in addition  our fuel costs increased during fiscal compared to fiscal we increased our use of fuel surcharges to offset a portion of these increased costs  thereby partially reducing the impact to operating income 
we adjust the carrying values of our corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis 
the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments  which include publicly traded securities 
as a result  the cash surrender values of these policies will fluctuate with changes in the market value of such securities 
the performance in the financial markets resulted in losses for these policies of  in fiscal  losses of  in fiscal and gains of  in fiscal the performance of the financial markets will continue to influence the cash surrender values of our corporate owned life insurance policies  which could cause volatility in operating income  net earnings and earnings per share 
the provision for losses on receivables included within operating expenses increased by  in fiscal over fiscal the current economic conditions and related decrease in consumer demand combined with tightening credit markets have impacted the liquidity of some of our customers  resulting in an increase in delinquent payments on accounts receivable 
customer accounts written off  net of recoveries  were  or of sales   or of sales  and  or of sales  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in our provision for losses on receivables is related to customer accounts across our customer base without concentration in any specific location 
we continue to monitor our customer account balances and our credit policies and believe continued strong credit practices will be necessary to avoid significant increases in our provision for losses on receivables 
however  if the difficult economic environment persists  we expect to continue to experience higher levels of provision for losses on receivables and higher levels of write offs  such as those experienced in fiscal  in fiscal pay related expenses decreased by  in fiscal from fiscal the reduction was due to a combination of reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation 
headcount declines occurred due to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions commensurate with lower sales 
the criteria for paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to overall company performance 
the overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses for fiscal were not met  therefore corporate executive officers will not receive bonuses for fiscal and operating company management bonuses are at lower levels for fiscal as compared to fiscal sysco s fuel costs increased by  in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices 
our fuel costs increased by  in fiscal over fiscal due to increased market diesel prices 
sysco s costs per gallon increased in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal sysco s activities to manage increased fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques  improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately  higher in fiscal over fiscal and  higher in fiscal than in fiscal usage of these surcharges was greater in the second half of fiscal and first half of fiscal  due to sustained  increased market diesel prices during that period 
fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins 

table of contents we periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated  of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated  of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in prices that were comparable to market prices 
as of june   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately  through march in july  we entered additional forward purchase commitments totaling approximately  at a fixed price through june together  these contracts will lock in the price of approximately of our fuel purchase needs for fiscal our commitments through august were entered into at prevailing rates from mid july through mid august as a result  these contracts are at fixed prices greater than both the prices incurred during same periods in the previous fiscal year and current market prices 
the remainder of our outstanding contracts were entered into at the prevailing rates in march  april and july and thus the fixed price on these contracts reflects the lower current market price for diesel 
fuel costs in fiscal  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to decrease by approximately  to  as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in mid august  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
however  consistent with the lower current market price for diesel  we expect fuel surcharge revenue to be significantly lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  declining by as much as  share based compensation cost in fiscal was  less than in fiscal share based compensation expense decreased  in fiscal from fiscal contributing to the decrease in both years was a reduction in the level of option grants being awarded compared to previous years  resulting in reduced compensation expenses being recognized 
also affecting the decrease in fiscal was the removal of the previous stock award component from the management incentive plan annual bonus awards beginning with fiscal as a result  the share based compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years was not incurred in fiscal  and overall share based compensation expense was reduced as compared to the prior year 
beginning in fiscal  we expect to replace the stock award component of the incentive bonuses with annual discretionary grants of restricted equity awards subject to time based vesting 
share based compensation expense in fiscal is expected to increase by  to  relative to fiscal due primarily to the anticipated discretionary grant of restricted awards in fiscal net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal were  higher than fiscal  due primarily to the recognition of actuarial losses from lower returns on assets of sysco s company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan during fiscal and the merging of participants from a multi employer pension plan the retirement plan see multi employer pension plans at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations  partially offset by a decrease in expense due to an increase in the discount rates used to calculate the plan s liabilities and amendments to our supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
net company sponsored pension costs decreased  in fiscal over the prior year  due primarily to the funding status and the projected asset performance of the retirement plan at that time 
net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal are expected to increase by approximately  over fiscal due primarily to lower returns on assets of the retirement plan during fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal we recorded provisions related to multi employer pension plans of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal see additional discussion of multi employer pension plans at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations 
net earnings net earnings declined in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below  as well as the factors discussed above 
net earnings increased in fiscal over fiscal due primarily to the factors discussed above  as well as the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted primarily by two factors 
first  the company recorded tax adjustments related to federal and state tax contingencies of  second  the loss of  which had a tax effect of  recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values was non deductible for income tax purposes and had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the period 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances of  previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets 

table of contents the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately  resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change   related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and  related to the reduction in net canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions  share based compensation expense and the recognition of losses of  which had a tax effect of  recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the recognition of gains of  which had a tax effect of  recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted by the recognition of tax and interest for tax contingencies 
sysco s affiliate  baugh supply chain cooperative bscc  is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments 
the internal revenue service irs  in connection with its audits of our through federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts 
sysco reached a settlement with the irs on august  to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis  pay the amounts currently recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a three year period and make a one time payment of  of which approximately  is non deductible 
the settlement addresses the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our through federal income tax returns  and settles the matter for all subsequent periods  including the and federal income tax returns already under audit 
we had previously accrued interest during the period of appeals and as a result of the settlement with the irs  sysco will record an income tax benefit of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal earnings per share basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased and  respectively  in fiscal from the prior year 
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased and  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year 
these changes were primarily the result of factors discussed above  as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding 
the net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases 
the net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and an increase in the number of anti dilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation 
as a result of the irs settlement noted above  sysco will record an income tax benefit of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal we expect this to positively impact our diluted earnings per share by approximately per share 
segment results we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments  of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise 
the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item of this form k 
intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies 
the segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments 
these centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments 
management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results  which include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs 
while a segment s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins  expenses  or a combination thereof  over the long term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth 
this is consistent with our long term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 

table of contents the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements in item operating income as a percentage of sales broadline sygma other the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements in item operating operating sales income sales income broadline sygma other sygma had operating income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments  the other segment  and intersegment sales  expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales  including intersegment sales  and operating income  respectively 
for purposes of this statistical table  operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal that are not charged to our segments 
this information should be read in conjunction with business segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements in item segment segment segment operating operating operating sales income sales income sales income broadline sygma other intersegment sales total included in corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments  among other items  are gains and losses recognized to adjust corporate owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values  share based compensation expense related to stock option grants  restricted stock  issuances of stock pursuant to the employees stock purchase plan and stock grants to non employee directors  and corporate level depreciation and amortization expense 
broadline segment broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to customers 
broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco s operations 
in fiscal  the broadline operating results represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 
there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments 
we have invested substantial amounts in assets  operating methods  technology and management expertise in this segment 
the breadth of its sales force  geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage this segment s earnings 
sales sales for fiscal were less than fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by compared to fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal case volume declines attributable to the impact of the current business 
table of contents environment caused a decline in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal product cost inflation  which led to increases in selling prices  partially offset case volume declines in fiscal sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars increased sales by compared to fiscal non comparable acquisitions did not have a material impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal product cost inflation  and the resulting increases in selling prices  was the primary contributor to sales growth 
in addition  fiscal growth was realized both from increased sales to multi unit customers and marketing associate served customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the efforts of our marketing associates and the use of business reviews with customers 
operating income the increase in operating income in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to effective management of operations in the current economic environment 
effective management was also evidenced by margins declining at a lower rate than our sales decline and by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods 
gross margin dollars decreased while operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal expense performance for fiscal was aided by lower payroll related expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies  partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on receivables 
the increase in operating income in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses 
we were able to manage our business effectively in the inflationary environment that existed in fiscal by managing margins and improving operating efficiencies 
gross margin dollars increased while operating expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal the high cost of fuel also impacted our broadline segment s results for fiscal and fiscal fuel costs were  higher in fiscal over fiscal fuel costs for fiscal were  higher than fiscal we attempt to mitigate increased fuel costs by reducing miles driven  improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 
in the second half of fiscal and first half of fiscal  our usage of fuel surcharges increased due to sustained increased market diesel prices 
fuel surcharges were approximately  higher in fiscal than in fiscal and  higher in fiscal than in fiscal consistent with the lower current market price for diesel  we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our broadline segment to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal we recorded provisions related to multi employer pension plans of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal sygma segment sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 
sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s other segments 
this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins 
these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 
sales sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal and greater in fiscal than fiscal although our sygma segment has been negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions  it achieved sales growth in both fiscal and fiscal  primarily due to significant contracts with new customers and product cost increases  which led to increases in selling prices 
these increases were partially offset by lost sales due to the elimination of unprofitable business and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting sygma s existing customer base 
one chain restaurant customer wendy s arby s group  inc accounted for approximately of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended june  sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer 
while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma  we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 
operating income operating income increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin dollars increased while operating expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas  as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions 

table of contents operating income in fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal in fiscal  sygma expensed  related to the write off of software development costs 
in addition  some of sygma s customers experienced a slowdown in their business resulting in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop 
expense reductions were accomplished by consolidating regional offices  reducing headcounts and not renewing unprofitable customer contracts 
the high cost of fuel also impacted our sygma segment s results for fiscal and fiscal fuel costs were  higher in fiscal over fiscal fuel costs for fiscal were  higher than fiscal sygma was able to partially offset these costs through increases in the fees charged to customers  including fuel surcharges  and by reducing expenses 
fuel surcharges were approximately  lower in fiscal than in fiscal and  higher in fiscal than in fiscal consistent with the lower current market price for diesel  we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal other segment other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments  including our specialty produce  custom cut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers 
these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 
on an aggregate basis  our other segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s broadline segment 
sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years 
these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry 
these operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment 
in fiscal  in the aggregate  the other segment represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments 
operating income decreased for fiscal over fiscal the decrease in operating income was caused primarily by reduced sales in all segments attributable to the deteriorating economic environment 
operating income increased for fiscal over fiscal the increase in operating income was generated primarily by improved results in the specialty produce and the lodging industry segments offset by reduced sales and operating income in the custom cut meat segment 
liquidity and capital resources sysco s strategic objectives require continuing investment 
our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
our operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  systems  fleet and other equipment  cash dividends  and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy 
in addition  this cash will be used to satisfy the requirements of the irs settlement over the next three years 
any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high quality  short term instruments or applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program 
as a part of our on going strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses  and our overall capital structure 
these transactions may materially impact our liquidity  borrowing capacity  leverage ratios and capital availability 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future  including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next twelve months  while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes 
during the recent tightening of the credit markets  we have continued to maintain the highest credit rating available for commercial paper 
we believe that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper market effectively 
we also issued long term senior notes totaling  under our shelf registration statement during the third quarter of fiscal in order to take advantage of the interest rates available to us at that time and to enhance our liquidity position 
we believe that we will continue to be able to access the long term capital market effectively

the decrease in accounts payable balances in fiscal was primarily from inventory decreases resulting from the sales decline 
the increases in accounts payable balances in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to inventory increases resulting from sales growth 
accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors  including changes in product mix  cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors 
cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by decreases in accrued expenses of  during fiscal and  during fiscal and positively impacted by an increase in accrued expenses of  during fiscal the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive bonuses  offset by lower accruals for current year incentive bonuses 
the decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below 
this decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixed rate debt issued in fiscal and an increase to a provision related to a multi employer pension plan 
see additional discussion of multi employer pension plans at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations 
the increase in accrued expenses during fiscal was primarily due to increased accruals for fiscal incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of  and the corresponding insurance receivable of  included within prepaid expenses and other current assets 
in fiscal  these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment in excess of our deductible

see additional discussion of an irs settlement at liquidity and capital resources  other considerations 
the decrease was partially offset by a combination of the recording of net company sponsored pension costs and incentive compensation deferrals 
the increase for fiscal was primarily attributable to a combination of the recording of net company sponsored pension costs  incentive compensation deferrals and a net increase to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  partially offset by pension contributions to our company sponsored plans 
the decrease in fiscal was due to pension contributions to our company sponsored plans exceeding the amount of net company sponsored pension costs recognized during the year 
we recorded net company sponsored pension costs of   and  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit plans were   and  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively

other considerations multi employer pension plans as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item  we contribute to several multi employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees 
under current law regarding multi employer defined benefit plans  a plan s termination  our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multi employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi employer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
based on the most recent information available from plan administrators  our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi employer plans we participate in  some of which appear to be underfunded  was estimated to be  as of june  based on a voluntary withdrawal 
because we are not provided the information by the plan administrators on a timely basis and we expect that many multi employer pension plans assets have declined due to recent stock market performance  we believe our share of the withdrawal liability could be greater 
required contributions to multi employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels 
in addition  the pension protection act  enacted in august  requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding 
we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions  withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 
as of june   we have approximately  in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multi employer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal has already occurred  all of which are expected to be paid in fiscal during fiscal  we obtained information that a multi employer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded that it was probable that additional funding would be required as well as the payment of excise tax 
as a result  during fiscal  we recorded a liability of approximately  related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we effectively withdrew from this multi employer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits for our employees that were participants in the plan and to manage our exposure to this under funded plan 
we agreed to pay  to the plan  which included the minimum funding requirements 
in connection with this withdrawal agreement  we merged active participants from this plan into sysco s company sponsored retirement plan and assumed  in liabilities 
the payment to the plan was made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal if this plan were to undergo a mass 
table of contents withdrawal  as defined by the pension benefit guaranty corporation  prior to september  we could have additional liability 
we do not currently believe a mass withdrawal from this plan prior to september is probable 
we have experienced other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from multi employer pension plans 
withdrawal liabilities incurred include  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal bscc cooperative structure sysco s affiliate  baugh supply chain cooperative bscc  is a cooperative taxed under subchapter t of the united states internal revenue code the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments 
the irs  in connection with its audits of our through federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts 
sysco reached a settlement with the irs on august  to cease paying us federal taxes related to bscc on a deferred basis  pay the amounts currently recorded within deferred taxes related to bscc over a three year period and make a one time payment of  of which approximately  is non deductible 
the settlement addresses the bscc deferred tax issue as it relates to the irs audit of our through federal income tax returns  and settles the matter for all subsequent periods  including the and federal income tax returns already under audit 
as a result of the settlement  we will pay the amounts owed in the following schedule amounts paid annually fiscal fiscal fiscal of the amounts to be paid in fiscal included in the table above   will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal and the remaining payments will be paid in quarterly installments beginning in the second quarter of fiscal amounts to be paid in fiscal and will be paid with sysco s quarterly tax payments 
we believe we have access to sufficient cash on hand  cash flows from operations and current access to capital to make payments on all of the amounts noted above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of june   certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans multi employer pension plans unrecognized tax benefits and interest irs deferred tax settlement unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to commercial paper and debt retirement plan long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods

represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions 
as of june   we had a liability of  for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and  for related interest that could result in cash payment 
sysco reached a settlement with the irs on august  related to timing of tax payments 
this will result in a one time payment of  as well as accelerating the payments previously deferred 
see further discussion of this settlement under note  subsequent events  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item apart from this settlement  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  the related non current balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table

such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year period ending in fiscal see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments

this amount is not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  company sponsored pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  goodwill and intangible assets and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy  has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods 
allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
in addition  in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  as was the case in fiscal  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
we also maintain a fully self insured group medical program 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
company sponsored pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
for guidance in determining the discount rates  we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes was a decrease in our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated  the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased to 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated  a increase in the discount rates for fiscal would decrease sysco s net company sponsored pension cost by  while a decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by  the impact of a increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates 
therefore  a increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a decrease in the discount rate 
as of june   our net actuarial losses from our company sponsored pension plans were  an increase of  we estimate the amortization of net actuarial losses will increase our fiscal pension expense by approximately  as compared to fiscal we look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
we used a plan specific age related set of rates for the retirement plan  which are equivalent to a single rate of as of june  and as of june  for determining the benefit obligations as of june   the serp calculations use an age graded salary growth assumption with reductions taken for determining fiscal pay due to base salary freezes in effect for fiscal as of june   the serp assumes various levels of base salary increase and decrease for determining pay for fiscal depending upon the participant s position with the company and a salary growth assumption for all participants for fiscal and thereafter 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and for fiscal in fiscal  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption was changed to a net return on assets assumption  which contributed to the decrease in the assumption to in fiscal prior to fiscal  this assumption represented gross return on assets  and plan expenses were reflected within service cost 
the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately   and over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in eight of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is for fiscal a increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net company sponsored pension costs for fiscal by approximately  pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june  was a charge  net of tax  of  which 
table of contents represented the net actuarial losses  prior service costs and transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of previous pension accounting standards as of that date 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june  was a charge  net of tax  of  changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions  increased net company sponsored pension costs by approximately  in fiscal increasing the net company sponsored pension costs by approximately  in fiscal were additional costs related to the merger of participants from a multi employer pension plan into sysco s company sponsored retirement plan see multi employer pension plans under other considerations for further discussion 
decreasing the net company sponsored pension costs by approximately  in fiscal was a change in the serp design 
the net impact of all of these changes was a net increase in fiscal in company sponsored pension costs of  changes in the assumptions  including changes to the discount rate discussed above  together with the normal growth of the plans  the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to increase net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal by approximately  we made cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  including voluntary contributions to the retirement plan of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our minimum required contribution to the retirement plan for the calendar plan year is estimated at  to meet erisa minimum funding requirements 
sysco will be required to pay quarterly contributions for the calendar plan year  the first installment of which must be made in fiscal we anticipate we will make  of contributions to the retirement plan in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp and other post retirement plans together are approximately income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
prior to fiscal  in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions  we established an accrual when  despite our belief that our tax return positions were supportable  we believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss was probable 
when facts and circumstances changed  these accruals were adjusted 
beginning in fiscal  we adopted a new accounting standard  which changed our accounting for uncertain tax positions 
this accounting standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position must be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
see discussion under note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
vendor consideration we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
in certain of these latter instances  the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by sysco 
in these cases  we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognize these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  annually or more frequently as needed  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets 
the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our six operating segments as described in note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item the components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units 
we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models 
the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our six operating segments 
the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums  earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past  future cash flow estimates of the reporting units  which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital  along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles recorded in fiscal  or our past estimates of fair value for fiscal  and have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results 
sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units 
in fiscal  the reporting units fair values would have had to have been lower by compared to the fair values estimated in our impairment analysis before additional analysis would have been indicated to determine if an impairment existed for any of our reporting units 
the other specialty produce  custom cut meat  lodging industry products and international distribution operations operating segments have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the broadline or sygma reporting units 
this is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired  and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the broadline and sygma segments 
in addition  these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the broadline segment 
as such  these other operating segments have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 
share based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plan and various non employee director plans 
as of june   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date 
the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post vesting restriction 
the fair value of the stock issued under the management incentive plans with respect to years prior to fiscal was based on the stock price on the last day of the fiscal year less a discount for post vesting restrictions 
the discount for post vesting restrictions was estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period 
the stock award component of the management incentive plan bonus awards was removed beginning in fiscal 
table of contents the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the management incentive plan through fiscal was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus related 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
in those cases  we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in other cases  certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate 
in these cases  if it is probable that the performance condition will be met  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the shorter performance period  otherwise  we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period 
in addition  certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds  the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee or director 
in these cases  for awards granted prior to july  our adoption date for the fair value recognition provisions in current stock compensation accounting standards  we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires 
for awards granted subsequent to july   we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement 
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded  a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options 
we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option 
in such cases  we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate

these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item a above and elsewhere 
in addition  the success of sysco s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
company sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
legal proceedings are impacted by events  circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco 
the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated  stock repurchases at historical levels  or other unexpected cash requirements

the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect  and laws and regulations  as well as methods of enforcement  are subject to change 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 
we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
fiscal as of june   we had no commercial paper outstanding

to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars 
our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements 
table of contents of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased sales in fiscal compared to fiscal the impact to our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal and fiscal a unfavorable change in the fiscal year end exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal sales by an additional and would not have materially impacted our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share 
we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our canadian financing subsidiary has the us dollar as its functional currency and has notes denominated in us dollars 
we have the potential to create taxable income in canada when this debt is paid due to changes in the exchange rate from the inception of the debt through the payment date 
a unfavorable change in the fiscal year end exchange rate and the resulting increase in the tax liability associated with these notes would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
fuel price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food prepared away from home 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  incurred by sysco increased by approximately  in fiscal over fiscal and  in fiscal over fiscal from time to time  we will enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
as of june   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately  through march in july  we entered additional forward purchase commitments totaling approximately  at a fixed price through june together  these contracts will lock in the price of approximately of our fuel purchase needs for fiscal our commitments through august were entered into at prevailing rates from mid july through mid august as a result  these contracts are at fixed prices greater than both the prices incurred during same periods in the previous fiscal year and current market prices 
the remainder of our outstanding contracts were entered into at the prevailing rates in march  april and july and thus the fixed price on these contracts reflects the lower current market price for diesel 
fuel costs in fiscal  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to decrease by approximately  to  as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in mid august  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
a unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would change the range of potential decrease to  to  investment risk sysco invests in corporate owned life insurance policies in order to fund certain retirement programs which are subject to market risk 
the value of our investments in corporate owned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments  which include publicly traded securities 
therefore  the value of these policies will be adjusted each period based on the performance of the underlying securities which could result in volatility in our earnings 
due to the declines in the financial markets in fiscal and fiscal  we have experienced significant losses in adjusting the carrying value of these policies to their cash surrender values in these periods 
should the financial markets decline  we would take charges to adjust the carrying value of our corporate owned life insurance  and if the market declines are significant  these charges could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating expenses  net income and earnings per share 
a unfavorable change in publicly traded securities held within our investments in corporate owned life insurance would not have a material impact on our operating expenses  net income and earnings per share 
our company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan s liability 
as a result of the declines in the financial markets in fiscal  the value of the investments held by the retirement plan declined as of june  as compared to june  these fluctuations in asset values have caused the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase  have caused pension expense for fiscal to increase and have resulted in a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of june   which is when this plan s funded status was last measured 
also  the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets 
specifically  decreases in these interest rates may have a material impact on our results of operations 
to the extent the financial markets experience further 
table of contents declines  our anticipated future contributions  pension expense and funded status will be affected for future years as well 
a unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company sponsored retirement plan at the plan s fiscal year end december  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal  however  this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal by  and would reduce our shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of june  by
