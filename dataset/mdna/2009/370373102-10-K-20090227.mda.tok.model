item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations constitutes management s review of the factors that affected our financial and operating performance for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a development stage company and began the development of the mt 
hope project on october  during the year ended december  we also completed work on a pre feasibility study of our liberty property 
we continue to prudently advance the liberty property but do not expect to spend appreciable amounts of capital on the liberty property until market conditions warrant the development of this property 
on october   our board of directors approved the development of the mt 
hope project as contemplated in our bankable feasibility study 
the company completed basic engineering of the mt 
hope project during the year ended december  and updated its capital cost estimate related to the mt 
hope project based upon having completed of the detailed engineering 
the development of the mt 
hope project has an estimated total capital requirement estimated at  million including development costs of approximately  million in dollars and million in cash bonding requirements and pre payments 
these amounts do not include financing costs or amounts necessary to fund operating working capital 
through the year ended december  we have spent approximately million and have million remaining cash on hand for use in the development of the mt 
hope project and other cash requirements 
our current operating plan is to continue with the approval process for the rod culminating in the receipt of the rod in the fourth quarter of additionally  we continue to advance the engineering and procurement process for long lead items to allow for the commencement of pre stripping and construction in the first quarter of with the commencement of operations in the first half of in order to keep this timetable it will be necessary for us to raise between and million in pre rod financing during and then to complete a project financing package for the construction of the project to be available in the first quarter of if pre rod financing is not obtained during it will be necessary to modify our plans and timetable to conserve the cash we currently have until such time as the credit markets  the molybdenum markets and the worldwide economy 
table of contents recover  although we would continue to pursue the receipt of rod in the fourth quarter of our options include renegotiating  restructuring  suspending or cancelling certain purchase orders which may result in the loss of some deposits and or incurrence of monetary suspension or cancellation charges 
additionally  the modified plans would delay the commencement of operations of the project and would increase the overall cost of the project 
major modifications to our plans and timetable would require the approval of pos minerals 
we anticipate that the revised plans would permit us to remain liquid through without additional financing 
the mt 
hope joint venture effective as of january   we contributed all of our interest in the assets related to the mt 
hope project  including the mt 
hope lease  to eureka moly  and in february the closing date entered into the mt 
hope project joint venture with pos minerals 
under the terms of the joint venture  pos minerals owns a interest in eureka moly  and general moly  through a subsidiary  owns an interest 
these ownership interests and or the required contributions under the joint venture can change as discussed below 
pursuant to the terms of the joint venture  pos minerals made its initial contributions to the joint venture totaling million during the year ended december  additionally  in the third quarter of  we paid to pos minerals million as a final purchase price adjustment based on the terms of the joint venture agreement related to the difference in the budgeted versus actual expenditures of the mt 
hope project prior to the closing date 
subject to pos minerals right to reduce its interest in the joint venture as described below  additional amounts will be due from pos minerals within days after the rod contribution date 
we are currently targeting the effectiveness of the rod and the satisfaction of the rod contribution conditions to occur in the fourth quarter of if the rod contribution date occurs on or before december   pos minerals is required to make the rod contribution installment to the joint venture in the amount of million plus its share of all joint venture costs incurred from the closing date through the rod contribution date  which is currently estimated to be million  to retain its interest 
if the rod contribution date occurs on or before december  and pos minerals does not make the million rod contribution installment  its ownership interest will be reduced to and it will be obligated to fund its remaining share of all development costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date to retain its interest 
if the rod contribution date occurs after december   pos minerals may elect to either retain its share by reducing the rod contribution installment from an additional million to an additional million plus its share of all joint venture costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date or reduce its ownership interest to and fund its remaining share of all joint venture costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date to retain this interest 
the initial contributions of million that were made by pos minerals during are available to fund the mt 
hope project joint venture costs incurred subsequent to the closing date 
we are required  pursuant to the terms of the joint venture  to advance funds required to pay costs for the development of the mt 
hope project that exceed the initial contributions until the rod contribution date  at which point the contributions described above to be made by pos minerals will be applied to reimburse us for pos minerals share of such development costs 
all costs incurred after the rod contribution date will be allocated and funded pro rata based on each party s ownership interest 
liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements year ended december  compared to year ended december  our cash balance at december  was million compared to million at december  additionally we have million of restricted cash that represents the unspent amount of the initial contributions from pos minerals that is available for the continuing development of the mt 
hope project 
our total consolidated cash balance at december  was million 
the increase in our cash balances was due primarily to the receipt of the million in contributions from pos minerals during and net proceeds from exercises of warrants and options of million  less development costs incurred during of million  deposits on property plant and equipment totaling million  general and administrative costs incurred during of and expense items of million incurred for 
table of contents continuing exploration and evaluation of our liberty property 
deposits on property  plant and equipment relate primarily to scheduled payments for long lead time equipment for the mt 
hope project 
see contractual obligations below 
total assets as of december  increased to million compared to million as of december  primarily as a result of the changes discussed in the preceding paragraph 
as discussed above under the mt 
hope joint venture  we are currently targeting that the rod contribution conditions will be satisfied and that we will receive the additional million rod contribution installment from pos minerals plus its share of joint venture costs incurred from the closing date to the rod contribution date costs by december  the satisfaction of the rod contribution conditions are subject to a number of factors that are beyond our control  including the issuance of the rod by the blm and the ability of third parties to initiate administrative or judicial appeals after the issuance of the rod 
as also discussed above under the mt 
hope joint venture  if the rod contribution conditions are not satisfied by december   pos minerals may elect to reduce its rod contribution installment from million to million  or alternatively  to reduce its interest from to  in which case we would only receive reimbursement for joint venture costs for the resulting percentage of ownership retained by pos minerals 
any reduction in the rod contribution installment to be received from pos minerals would have an adverse effect on the liquidity of the mt 
hope project and would require additional financing 
our current operating plan  which includes the deferrals negotiated through february  for purchase contracts as defined under contractual obligations below  assuming the rod is issued as anticipated in the fourth quarter of and the rod contribution conditions are satisfied by december   is to maintain a project schedule to allow for start up of the mt 
hope project in the first half of  which would be to months after the effectiveness of the rod 
we believe the cash on hand at december  including the cash restricted for use in the joint venture will be sufficient to fund our joint venture development as planned  our exploration  evaluation and operating activities  as well as our other planned operations  through the third quarter of in order to fund the activities of the joint venture and our other operations through the anticipated rod contribution date  we are continuing to evaluate a number of potential sources for approximately to million in interim financing  including additional support from current strategic partners  the possibility of a sale of another minority interest in the mt 
hope project  debt from private investment groups  as well as the capital markets 
due to the delay in the anticipated effective date of the rod to the fourth quarter of  we entered into negotiations with our major equipment suppliers under our purchase contracts to delay receipt of equipment to a time consistent with our current timetable for the development of the mt 
hope project and to reduce our required cash needs through the anticipated rod contribution date 
we have successfully renegotiated most purchase contracts and anticipate renegotiating the remaining purchase contracts to match delivery dates of equipment with our current timetable 
see contractual obligations below 
if pre rod interim financing for the mt 
hope project is not obtained by mid  we will have insufficient cash available to make all progress payments under our purchase contracts in addition to maintaining our current timetable 
at that time we would need to further modify our schedule  including reduction in planned levels of engineering  procurement  construction and other development activities and we would pursue further contract modifications with our major equipment suppliers for extensions of delivery times and of progress payments  to the extent possible  in a manner that will permit the continued development of the mt 
hope project consistent with such revised timetable while conserving cash until the receipt of additional financing or additional capital contributions from pos minerals 
should such contract negotiations be unsuccessful we may selectively cancel certain purchase contracts to maintain a positive liquidity position through see contractual obligations below 
once the rod is effective  additional capital will be required through the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project  which commercial production is estimated to begin in the first half of our ability to develop the project on time and on budget is dependent on  among other things  the permitting process and our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund the mt 
hope project both in sufficient amount and in a timely manner 
additionally  if the currently estimated costs of the mt 
hope project are exceeded we will need to raise additional capital to fund such overruns 
the company is currently  and will on an ongoing basis be  pursuing the most efficient sources of funding for the project including  but not limited to  the equity markets  the bank project finance markets and the high yield capital debt markets 
the long term cash needs for the development of the mt 
hope project require that we or eureka moly obtain project financing or other significant financing in addition to the capital contributions anticipated to be received from pos minerals 
the aggregate amount of additional financing required for the development of the mt 
hope project  minus the amounts anticipated to be received from pos minerals on the rod contribution date if the rod contribution conditions 
table of contents are satisfied by december   is anticipated to be approximately million 
this amount would increase if pos minerals reduces its ownership interest and or if the rod contribution conditions are not satisfied by december   as discussed above 
that amount may be reduced by any interim financing that we or eureka moly are able to obtain prior to the receipt of additional capital contributions or project financing 
during  we engaged barclays capital and credit suisse securities usa llc to assist the joint venture in its efforts to pursue an ultimate project financing for the mt 
hope project 
our ability to obtain such project financing depends on the effectiveness and the timing of the rod  the anticipated price of molybdenum  our projected fixed and variable operating costs and the overall state of the economy and the credit markets in general 
recent disruptions in national and international credit markets have led to very illiquid and volatile conditions 
there is a scarcity of credit and lenders are imposing tighter lending standards and higher interest costs for loans 
our ability to obtain the necessary funding for the mt 
hope project as well as the terms for such funding may be adversely affected by these disruptions in the credit markets 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary financing for the mt 
hope project in a timely manner  on customary or favorable terms  or at all 
we also require additional capital to maintain our mining claims and other rights related to the liberty property  as well as continue payment of ongoing general and administrative costs associated with supporting our planned operations 
if we are unable to raise the interim or project financing capital when needed  it will be necessary to implement our plans to conserve cash which will delay the development and completion of the mt 
hope project 
these plans require changes to our program and budget and in accordance with our joint venture agreement will be subject to agreement with pos minerals 
such plans may include selectively suspending  cancelling or attempting to renegotiate contracts  as well as reductions in planned levels of engineering  procurement  construction and other development activities 
we believe such efforts will permit us to remain liquid through without additional funding 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our cash balance as of december  was million compared to million as of december  total assets as of december  were million compared to million as of december  these increases were due primarily to receipt of proceeds from the private placements of our securities that were completed in  offset by expenditures for exploration  evaluation and development of our mt 
hope project and continuing exploration and evaluation of our liberty property plus expenditures for our general and administrative costs 
during the years ended december  and we completed private placements of units and exercises of warrants and stock options for net cash proceeds of million and million  respectively 
our exploration  evaluation  development and general and administrative activities required the use of million and million  respectively  during these same periods 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  we had a net loss of million compared with a net loss of million in the same period for for the year ended december  and  exploration and evaluation expenses were million and million  respectively 
during the entire nine months ended september  both our mt 
hope project and our liberty property were in the exploration and evaluation stage 
in october the mt 
hope project advanced to the development stage 
for the year ended december  we incurred exploration and evaluation costs on the liberty property as we completed a pre feasibility study on the liberty property in april for the year ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december  and we incurred million and million  respectively in non cash equity compensation for management and directors included in the general and administrative expenses above 
the amounts in were significantly higher than in as a greater amount of equity compensation was incurred during the year ended december  as we added new management personnel and directors as part of a reorganization and expansion of the executive team compared with the same period in the cash portion of our general and administrative expense was approximately the same in both periods 

table of contents interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million in as a result of higher cash balances in compared with the corresponding periods in year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  we had a net loss of million compared with a net loss of million in the same period for for the year ended december  and  exploration and evaluation expenses were million and million  respectively 
during the entire nine months ended september  both our mt 
hope project and our liberty property were in the exploration and evaluation stage 
in october the mt 
hope project advanced to the development stage 
the significant increase in exploration and evaluation expenses during were as a result of the work performed to complete the bankable feasibility study for the mt 
hope project which was completed in the third quarter of for the year ended december  and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december  and we incurred million and million  respectively in non cash equity compensation for management and directors included in the general and administrative expenses above

contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase contracts advance royalties and deferral fees provision for post closure reclamation and remediation total as a continuing part of the development of the mt 
hope project  eureka moly has been  and continues to place orders for mining and milling equipment that must be built to specification and requires a long lead time for engineering and manufacturing 
contractual commitments for long lead items require progress payments during the engineering and fabrication of the equipment and have cancellation penalties in the event eureka moly cancels the contract 

table of contents at december   we have contracts to purchase two kv primary transformers  a primary crusher  a semi autogenous mill  two ball mills  various motors for the mills  two electric shovels  two multi hearth molybdenum roasters  flotation cells  three blast hole drills  haul trucks and other equipment collectively  the purchase contracts 
as described above in liquidity and capital resources  given the delay in the anticipated effective date of the rod and the rod contribution date  we entered into negotiations with our major equipment suppliers under our purchase contracts 
the following table sets forth eureka moly s cash commitments under purchase contracts at december   and the revised cash commitments under purchase contracts as of february  resulting from the re negotiation of certain purchase contracts in millions 
period cash commitments under purchase contracts as of december  cash commitments under purchase contracts as of february  st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total total in addition to the renegotiations completed we are continuing to renegotiate purchase contracts to extend the delivery times and cash commitments for equipment while maintaining equipment delivery times so as to not delay the commencement of operations based on our current timetable 
if eureka moly does not make payments required under the purchase contracts  it could be subject to claims for breach of contract or to cancellation of the purchase contract 
in addition  we may proceed to selectively suspend  cancel or attempt to renegotiate additional purchase contracts if we are forced to further conserve cash 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
if we cancel or breach any contracts  we will take all appropriate action to minimize any losses  but could be subject to claims or penalties under the contracts or applicable law 
the cancellation of certain key contracts would cause a delay in the commencement of operations  have ramifications under the joint venture with pos minerals and would add to the cost to develop our interest in the mt 
hope project 
critical accounting estimates estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  upon settlement  actual results may differ from estimated amounts 
provision for taxes income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under this approach  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset if management does not believe we have met the more likely than not standard imposed by sfas no 
to allow recognition of such an asset 
property  plant and equipment the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of estimated future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
table of contents is less than the carrying amount of the related asset grouping  asset impairment is considered to exist 
the related impairment loss is measured by comparing estimated future net cash flows on a discounted basis to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in significant assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates may have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
to date no such impairments have been identified 
property and equipment are being depreciated over useful lives of three to seven years using straight line depreciation 
share based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are a development stage company in the business of the exploration  development and mining of properties primarily containing molybdenum 
as a result  upon commencement of production  which is estimated to begin at the mt 
hope project in the first half of  our financial performance could be materially affected by fluctuations in the market price of molybdenum and other metals we may mine 
the market prices of metals can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors 
these factors include fluctuations with respect to the rate of inflation  the exchange rates of the us dollar and other currencies  interest rates  global or regional political and economic conditions  banking environment  global and regional demand  production costs  and investor sentiment 
in order to better manage commodity price risk and to seek to reduce the negative impact of fluctuations in prices  we will seek to enter into long term supply contracts 
on december   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with arcelormittal that provides for arcelormittal to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
the supply agreement provides for a floor price along with a discount for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years after the commencement of commercial production at the mt 
hope project 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 
additionally  on may   we entered into a molybdenum supply agreement with seah besteel corporation seah besteel  korea s largest manufacturer of specialty steels  that provides for seah besteel to purchase million pounds of molybdenum per year  plus or minus  once the mt 
hope project commences commercial operations at minimum specified levels 
like the arcelormittal supply agreement  the supply agreement with seah besteel provides for a floor price along with staged discounts for spot prices above the floor price and expires five years from the date of first supply under the agreement 
both the floor and threshold levels at which the percentage discounts change are indexed to a producer price index 
on august   the company entered into a molybdenum supply agreement the sojitz agreement with sojitz corporation 
the sojitz agreement provides for the supply of million pounds per year of molybdenum for five years  beginning once the mt 
hope project reaches certain minimum commercial production levels 
one million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be subject to a per pound molybdenum floor price and is offset by a flat discount to spot moly prices above the floor 
the remaining four million annual pounds sold under the sojitz agreement will be sold with reference to spot moly prices without regard to a floor price 
in the event we do not achieve commercial production by january   sojitz corporation has the option to cancel this agreement 
while we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past  we may elect to enter into derivative financial instruments to manage commodity price risk 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not expect to enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk as of december   we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of million 
if and to the extent that these funds were invested in interest bearing instruments during the entire year ended december   a hypothetical decrease in the rate of interest earned on these funds would affect our income for the year ended december  by approximately million
