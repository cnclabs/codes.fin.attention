table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general meridian is an independent oil and natural gas company that explores for  acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties utilizing d seismic technology 
our operations have historically been focused on the onshore oil and natural gas regions in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
in recent years  the company s goal has been to replace our reserves  and to strengthen our reserve base with longer lived properties from our new areas for exploration 
increases in the prices of oil and natural gas over the past several years have favorably impacted our earnings from operations and enabled us to increase exploration efforts  and our capital spending has increased 
however  recent economic developments  most importantly the precipitous decrease in the prices of oil and natural gas in the second half of  have necessitated that we reduce capital investment and revise our short term focus 
while our long term objective has not changed  our short term goals currently focus on maintaining and improving production  increasing working capital through property sales  and conserving cash through cost saving measures 
the following discussion points are organized around the issues upon which our management is most highly focused  as well as the industry conditions that most influence our performance  the discussion contains information relating to the past year s performance as well as to our present circumstances and expectations for the coming fiscal year 
following that discussion  we provide the customary year to year analysis of our results of operations  and an expanded review of our liquidity 
industry and economic conditions 
the oil and gas industry has experienced significant volatility in the past year 
after several years of rising demand  costs of exploration and development had risen in tandem with the prices for energy products 
these economic trends encouraged exploration in more marginal areas at higher costs 
however  in the second half of  energy prices dropped precipitously 
west texas intermediate traded on the spot market at approximately per bbl in july  by december   the price was approximately per bbl 
natural gas similarly reached a spot market high in july of over per mmbtu  but by year end was trading at approximately per mmbtu 
global capital markets have experienced significant disruptions in the past year  resulting in the closing or restructuring of numerous large financial institutions 
extreme uncertainty about creditworthiness  liquidity and interest rates  as well as the global economic recession  continue to limit credit availability 
typically  as is the case with meridian  exploration and production companies borrow against the value of their proved reserves 
when the market value of those reserves decreases due to energy price fluctuations  their ability to borrow declines  coupled with the recently tightened credit environment  exploration and production companies are experiencing a significant loss of credit availability  and meridian is no exception 
the decrease in oil and natural gas prices has also caused operating cash flows to decline across the industry and at meridian  coupled with the loss of credit access  companies cash resources may be extremely stressed 
credit agreements 
commodity prices are a significant factor in the determination of the borrowing base available to the company under our credit facility 
recently  the company s access to capital was restricted by a reduction in the borrowing base  and our ability to fund capital expenditures has significantly decreased 
in december  the borrowing base was reduced to equal the amount already outstanding  leaving no additional credit available 
this impacts the company s capital spending plans and our ability to replace reserves 
as explained under item i  general recent developments  we are in default under certain covenants under the terms of our credit facility  and although our lenders have not responded with a notice of exercise of remedies  they may 
similarly  we are also in default under the terms of our rig note  which may also be declared in default by the lenders 
under each of these debt agreements  the lenders may accelerate all interest and 
table of contents principal payments in the event of default 
accordingly  we have classified the million of debt outstanding under the credit facility at december   as well as the million rig note  as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition  the borrowing base under our credit facility is scheduled for the next redetermination as of april  the lenders may set the base at a level below outstanding borrowings 
in that case  the company would be required to repay the deficit within days 
as of december   our net working capital reflects a deficit of approximately million  which includes million of amounts due under these two debt agreements which have been reclassified as current as a result of the defaults noted above 
cash preservation and strict management of cash flow are currently our highest priorities 
we are currently pursuing a number of options to raise cash by selling non strategic properties on reasonable terms  as well as reducing our ownership in some of our core properties 
our intent is to maintain ownership in our core production areas of south louisiana and east texas 
see item  general current plans for more detailed information on our current plans 
reserves 
our management has always focused on our reserve base  both the volume of proved reserves and the value of our future net revenues  which we calculate following sec rules using the prices prevailing at the end of the period 
during  our total proved reserves decreased bcfe  due to production and because downward revisions exceeded total reserves added through discoveries  extensions  and positive revisions 
we concentrated drilling efforts in on the east texas austin chalk gas play 
although results there were generally encouraging  with seven new producing wells in  performance of wells drilled in the chalk in failed to reach expectations and some of our plans for development are considered uneconomic at current prices 
these factors affected reserves by contributing negative revisions and decreasing the contribution of economic reserves from new discoveries 
prices for oil and natural gas 
our revenues  operating profits  property impairment expense  and access to credit are all significantly impacted by the price of oil and natural gas 
prices also strongly influence our drilling programs  impacting the economic projections for proposed exploration and development activity 
while we received historically high average prices for oil and natural gas in  by year end our expected oil price  as utilized in our reserve estimates  had decreased approximately from the average received in similarly  our expected natural gas price decreased approximately from the average received in the prices used in our reserve report are based on the prices prevailing at december   since that date  energy prices have continued to be extremely volatile  showing generally further declines 
our estimated present value of future net revenues before tax from oil and natural gas at december  is million  a decrease of million  or  from the value one year earlier 
the decrease is due to both the bcfe decrease in reserves explained above  and the decrease in prices used to compute the value of our reserves 
at december   the price per mcfe used in computing future net revenues was  at december  it was per mcfe  or lower 
ceiling test 
the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties are limited according to sec full cost accounting rules to the present value of our future net revenues from oil and natural gas the ceiling test 
due to the decrease in prices at year end  as well as to the decrease in our reserves  we recorded a significant non cash impairment  or ceiling test write down  to our oil and natural gas properties of million 
the impairment was also necessitated by the changed economics of our drilling program  a majority of our exploration efforts in the east texas austin chalk were predicated on an expectation of higher natural gas prices than those we now expect to receive  and many of our newer wells were drilled when drilling costs had increased in tandem with increases in energy prices 
we have curtailed our exploration and development plans for these economic reasons  as well as due to cash constraints  and the future value of our reserves accordingly reflects the reduction in the volume of undeveloped reserves 
however  the most significant 
table of contents factors necessitating the ceiling test write down were the decreases in prices and reserves  which directly decrease the ceiling 
based on the continued volatility of energy prices since december   and the trend toward price decreases  meridian may have an additional non cash impairment in the first quarter of production 
management closely monitors production 
results for reflect a decline in production of overall  primarily in the production of gas 
this is the result of natural production declines in our mature south louisiana properties 
management team and non routine contract settlement expenses 
during  we settled the compensation contracts for our former chief executive officer  mr 
joseph a 
reeves  and our former chief operating officer and president  mr 
michael j 
mayell 
the settlement resulted in a significant cash charge of million to general and administrative expense  terminating all obligations under these contracts 
in addition  we terminated the deferred compensation plan under which messrs 
reeves and mayell had received stock rights in lieu of cash compensation for many years 
the termination resulted in issuance of approximately million new shares of common stock  and a cash payment of approximately million in lieu of stock for personal withholding taxes related to the stock issuance 
messrs 
reeves and mayell remain on our board of directors  and will provide professional services to the company under short term consulting contracts that terminate on april  expenses 
in addition to the non routine contract settlement expense in  we recorded approximately million in compensation expense  net of capitalization  for employee retention bonuses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for further information about this incentive plan for non executive employees 
this non routine item has increased our expenses in  but will have a lesser expense impact in approximately million expected in the first quarter of  however  the cash impact will be greater in due to the second payment of approximately million due march  we have taken steps in early to reduce our annual expenses  both in the field and in the office 
we reduced our staff by approximately people  or 
the severance expense for the employees will be recorded in the first quarter of  and will eliminate the retention incentive bonus they would otherwise have received and is included in the million expected expense mentioned above 
the majority of the reduction was in our houston office 
we also have made changes to certain field operations that are also expected to yield cost savings 
we will continue to review all expenses for additional opportunities for savings 
drilling rig obligations 
although baseline field expenses are expected to decline during  potential cash expenditures related to drilling obligations are expected to continue to be significant 
during  in order to ensure access to a drilling rig with the technical specifications appropriate to our drilling program  we committed to purchase a drilling rig 
at the time  such rigs were in high demand  and as a result of this demand  our drilling program was faced with delays and increased costs 
the purchased rig was largely constructed in  and was placed in service near the end of the first quarter of  at a total cost of million 
we do not operate the rig  we lease the rig to orion drilling company  lp orion 
orion pays us a monthly rental fee based on of the monthly net profits of rig operation 
the lease of the rig to orion runs concurrently with a dayrate contract we have entered  under which orion operates the rig 
each agreement is for twenty four months terminating in march  pursuant to our dayrate contract with orion  we are obligated to pay the dayrate regardless of any inability to use the rig which may arise 
when the rig is not in use on our wells  orion may contract it to third parties  or the rig may be idled 
orion has been cooperative in actively seeking other parties to use the rig  and in agreeing to credit our obligation to some extent  based on revenues from other parties who utilize the rig when the company is unable to 
the rig was used continuously during in our east texas drilling efforts  during the first quarter of  the rig has 
table of contents been effectively subleased to others  but for short duration  at rates which are less than the dayrate under our contract 
we are obligated for the difference in dayrates 
we cannot predict whether such use by third parties will be consistent  nor to what extent it may offset our obligations under the dayrate contract 
we have an additional drilling rig commitment with orion for a second rig  which we do not own  this is also a dayrate contract  which will terminate in february  we have used this rig continuously in our east texas drilling program  and it is currently drilling one well which was in progress at december  we have no firm plans to utilize the rig once this well is complete  and have requested that orion assist us in reducing our obligation under the same understanding as the owned rig described above 
that is  we have requested that orion utilize the rig on other projects and credit our contractual obligation based on this third party usage 
these obligations impact our drilling plans as well as critical cash flow projections for the coming months 
if the rigs are idled  or if orion is unable to fully credit the commitment under our dayrate drilling contracts when the rigs are utilized by third parties  we will incur losses which cannot be capitalized as part of the cost of oil and natural gas properties 
the market for drilling rigs deteriorated in the second half of in tandem with prices for oil and natural gas 
our rig  which includes a top drive  is a well equipped  long lived asset and nearly new 
while we believe it retains value  utilization in the short term is uncertain  and dayrates have decreased 
based on the economic information available to us  and using conservative estimates of utilization and dayrates  we estimated the present value of the rig at million as of december  accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment expense of million to write down the net book value of the rig to million 
due to the continued volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas  and its negative effect on the drilling industry  we will continue to review this asset for additional impairment 
we cannot predict whether additional impairment will be necessary 
exploration commitment 
the company has an exploration commitment under a contract regarding exploration in an area which management no longer believes has potential 
the commitment totals million and is due in the third quarter of it was recorded as a current liability and included in our full cost pool before impairment 
tax rate 
our effective income tax rate has varied significantly in the past several years 
during periods of profitability  the effective rate was approximately  which is greater than the corporate income tax rate of primarily due to state taxes and other permanent differences 
in  we recorded a significant loss due to the non cash impairment expense described above  the tax benefit to the consolidated statement of operations resulting from the loss was limited to million  which is the amount of our deferred tax liabilities at december  we limited the tax benefit by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting from the net loss because management believes  given our overall current financial position  that there are significant uncertainties regarding our ability to generate net profits in the near term 
thus the effective income tax rate for is anomalous 
future effective tax rates will be reduced by the exhaustion of the valuation allowance over time 
the total valuation allowance is million 
tax audit 
in the fourth quarter of  we were notified by the internal revenue service that meridian would be audited for fiscal years and we have engaged tax consultants to assist us in cooperating with the audit  which has progressed satisfactorily  although we cannot predict the outcome of the audit 
operations overview during  we achieved several goals in the areas of drilling success  production rates  favorable hedges  drilling cost reductions and prospect development 

table of contents meridian participated in  drilled or recompleted successful wells  eight in east texas austin chalk  nine in south louisiana  and one in texas offshore 
we managed to maintain roughly flat production levels by offsetting our fields decline rates  and to enhance our and cash flow with favorable hedges 
drilling cost for wells in east texas were reduced by approximately compared to wells drilled in we moved out of some uneconomic areas new albany shale  palo duro basin  oklahoma and delaware basin and have generated several promising prospects in the atchafalaya bay and barataria bay areas by optimizing our well developed in house seismic databases and technical team 
like many of our peers  meridian was also forced to deal with several challenges 
those challenges included production interruptions from two hurricanes and severe commodity price swings that required us to report a non cash ceiling test impairment as well as negative revisions to proved reserves 
the two areas in which meridian was most active in were east texas and south louisiana 
east texas austin chalk during meridian participated in nine wells in the east texas austin chalk area  including seven successful completions  and two wells still drilling or under evaluation as of december  the successful wells include blackstone minerals a no 
h tested at gross daily flow rates of up to mmcfe d black stone minerals no 
tested at gross daily flow rates of up to mmcfe d freeman no

tested at gross daily flow rates of up to mmcfe d blackstone minerals a no 
tested at gross daily flow rates of up to mmcfe d sutton a no 
tested at gross daily flow rates of up to mmcfe d 
the key to being successful in this area is our focus on strict management of drilling and completion costs and leveraging our large acreage position through development drilling 
south louisiana during meridian recompleted or drilled nine wells in the company s legacy asset areas of south louisiana 
the successful wells include goodrich cocke no 
gross daily flow rate of bopd avoca no

gross daily flow rate of bopd weeks bay no 
tested at a gross daily flow rate of bopd south louisiana remains a core area for near term and long term upside for meridian 
weeks island field is the company s largest oil field and continues to provide us additional opportunities from new well locations  sidetracks and development drilling 
we are evaluating our reprocessed d seismic data over weeks island 
table of contents and other regions of south louisiana 
the re processed and newly acquired d data has enhanced our generation of lower to moderate risk new projects in this core area where we are already active and have operations and production facilities in place 
we anticipate drilling and recompletion activity in this area during  primarily in the weeks island and biloxi marshland areas 
south texas levering off the knowledge and experience gained in the east texas austin chalk  we expanded beyond its currently established boundaries to potentially explore and test acreage located in the south central texas counties of karnes and lavaca 
last year  meridian built a  acre leasehold position where we anticipate that potential production will have a higher oil content than our current production in the initial wells in east texas 
our leases are still in their primary term  due to constraints on our capital budget  management plans to observe the exploration results of other operators during  in order to gain additional geological and operational information about this play 
capital expenditure plans for the company anticipates the capital spending budget will be primarily used for recompletions and similar work on existing properties  and for lease maintenance costs 
we anticipate that the budget will be significantly lower than in past years  reflecting our expectations of reduced cash flows due to commodity price declines and the loss of availability of funds under the credit facility 
these factors will significantly impact funds available for capital spending 
we currently anticipate funding the plan utilizing cash flow from operations and cash on hand  augmented by proceeds from sales of assets as possible 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue 
oil and natural gas revenues  which include oil and natural gas hedging activities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  during the twelve months ended december   decreased million to million  as compared to revenues of million  due to a decrease in production volumes primarily from natural production declines  partially offset by a increase in average commodity prices on a natural gas equivalent basis and new discoveries brought on between the comparable periods 
our average daily production decreased to mmcfe for from mmcfe during oil and natural gas production volume totaled  mmcfe for  compared to  mmcfe for during  the company s drilling activity was primarily focused in the east texas project area and the terrebonne parish area of south louisiana

oil and natural gas operating expenses on an aggregate basis decreased million to million in  compared to million in on a unit basis  lease operating expenses increased per mcfe to per mcfe for the year from per mcfe for the year oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased between the periods primarily due to lower insurance and workover costs  in addition  some fields were shut in during the third and fourth quarters of due to hurricane damage 
the increase in the per mcfe rate was attributable to the lower production between the two corresponding periods 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily because of an increase in the average price of oil 
meridian s oil and natural gas production is primarily from louisiana and is therefore subject to louisiana severance tax 
the severance tax rates for louisiana are of gross oil revenues and per mcf effective july  for natural gas 
generally in  although total revenue was flat  a larger proportion was generated from oil  for which severance taxes are computed on a percentage basis 
natural gas taxes are based on a per mcf rate which on average did not significantly change 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes increased to per mcfe for from per mcfe for the effective severance tax rate for oil is significantly higher than that for natural gas  particularly when natural gas prices are trending higher  as they were throughout a good portion of  thus the change in the mix of revenues and volumes toward more oil increased the effective tax rate  which is reflected in the per unit costs 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense decreased million during to million compared to million for this was primarily the result of a decrease in production volumes in compared to  partially offset by an increase in the depletion rate compared to on a unit basis  depletion and depreciation expenses increased to per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for depletion and depreciation expense on a per mcfe basis increased primarily due to capital costs 
impairment of long lived assets 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices as of december   resulted in the company recognizing a non cash impairment totaling million of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
in addition  we recorded impairment expense of million on our drilling rig 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  for additional information 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of costs capitalized in our oil and natural gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  increased million to million in compared to million for the year  primarily due to the cost of a retention bonus program for non executive employees  and to a contract settlement with a former employee

the company recorded accretion expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the slight decrease in levels in comparison to is primarily the result of revisions to estimated abandonment costs and actual abandonments  offset by additional wells drilled and placed on production during the year 
hurricane damage repairs 
hurricane damage repairs of million were recorded in for hurricanes ike and gustav  primarily related to the company s insurance deductibles for each storm 
there were no hurricane damage repairs recorded in interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease was primarily a result of decreased interest rates during  partially offset by higher debt balances 
taxes on income 
income tax expense for was a benefit of million as compared to a provision of million for income taxes are generally provided on book income after taking into account permanent differences between book income and taxable income

during  insurance premiums increased by million and represented of the difference in lease operating expenses between the periods 
during the second quarter of approximately million was expensed due to a civil penalty arising from environmental litigation see note to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining million increase in operating expenses was associated with the addition and acquisition of producing wells and additional costs related to biloxi marshlands area production and facilities including compression  storage  and repairs 
although the company s insurance costs rose for the period from may through april  the premium for the policy for may through april has decreased by approximately 
we continue to insure our assets with improved coverage as a safeguard against losses for the company in the event of another hurricane 
the increase in the per mcfe rate was additionally attributable to the lower production between the two corresponding periods 

table of contents severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased million to million in  compared to million in  primarily because of a decrease in oil and natural gas production partially offset by a higher average natural gas tax rate 
meridian s oil and natural gas production is primarily from louisiana and is therefore subject to louisiana severance tax 
the severance tax rates for louisiana are of gross oil revenues and per mcf effective july  for natural gas 
for the first six months of  and the last six months of  the rate was per mcf for natural gas  an increase from per mcf for the first half of on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes increased to per mcfe for from per mcfe for depletion and depreciation

on a unit basis  depletion and depreciation expenses decreased to per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for depletion and depreciation expense on a per mcfe basis decreased primarily due to the impact of the impairment of long lived assets during as referenced below 
impairment of long lived assets

the company has charged approximately million and million to earnings as accretion expense during and  respectively 
the increase in levels in comparison to is primarily the result of additional wells drilled and placed on production during the year and revisions to estimated abandonment costs in the industry 

table of contents hurricane damage repairs 
there were no hurricane damage repairs recorded in  as compared to million in related to damages incurred from the hurricanes katrina and rita  primarily related to the company s insurance deductible and repair costs in excess of insured values 
due to the extensive damage throughout the area and the limited resources available for repairs  significant cost increases were experienced by the industry 
the actual repair costs were higher than originally estimated and exceeded our claim limits and therefore resulted in increased expense 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million for the increase was primarily a result of increased interest rates during taxes on income 
the provision benefit for income tax expense for was million as compared to million for income taxes are generally provided on book income after taking into account permanent differences between book income and taxable income

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  primarily due to funding million of contract settlement expenses in for certain officers see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein and lower oil and natural gas revenues primarily due to lower production  partially offset by changes in working capital accounts 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to higher expenditures for property and equipment in net cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million for historically  the trend of our cash provision has been toward increasing use of our credit facility and other new debt in thousands cash provided by operating activities net drawdown under credit facility new debt for drilling rig sales of property cash utilized in additions to property and equipment repurchase of common stock reductions of drilling rig debt other source uses  net net increase decrease in cash as noted above  we are in default under the terms of our credit facility  and our borrowing base is limited to the million currently borrowed 
this has also triggered an event of default under our rig note 
the lenders under the rig note have been timely advised of the default under the credit facility and may respond with a declaration of default under the rig note 
under both these debt agreements  the creditors may accelerate all payments of principle and interest in response to an event of default  or they may elect to take other action 
thus far  neither lender has responded with a notice of any exercise of remedies 
with credit markets extremely tight and the decrease in value of our proved reserves due to decreased energy prices  it is unlikely that supplemental credit sources will be available to us in the near term 
in addition  the terms of our credit facility restrict our ability to engage in other borrowing transactions 
at present  cash flows from operations and sales of property are our primary sources of cash 
we anticipate reduced cash from operations in  due to the significant reduction in prices for oil and natural gas  and due to expected natural production declines  although we expect some offsets due to reduced general and administrative and field operations expenses 
however  as described earlier  we have obligations under two long term drilling contracts which may significantly impact operational cash flows 
if we are unable to effectively sublease the two rigs continuously  or if the terms of agreements do not completely cover the commitment under our drilling contracts  we will incur negative cash flow under those contracts 
we hope to limit such losses by utilizing the rigs in our own drilling as intended  but significant uncertainty exists regarding our capital expenditures for and forward 
reduction in capital spending is our first alternative after expense reductions to improve cash flow

current credit facility 
on december   the company amended the credit facility to provide for a four year million senior secured credit facility the credit facility with fortis capital corp  as administrative agent  sole lead arranger and bookrunner  comerica bank as syndication agent  and union bank of california as documentation agent 
bank of nova scotia  allied irish banks plc  rzb finance llc and standards bank plc completed the syndication group 
the initial borrowing base under the credit 
table of contents facility was million 
the borrowing base under the credit facility was redetermined by the syndication group to be million effective october  the terms of the credit facility contain numerous covenants and restrictions 
currently  we are in default of a covenant which requires that we maintain a current ratio as defined in the credit facility of one to one 
our current ratio  as defined  is at december  presently  our lenders have been informed of our default under these covenants  and have not responded with a notice of any exercise of remedies 
among the remedies available to the lenders upon an event of default is acceleration of all principal and interest payments 
accordingly  we have classified all indebtedness under the credit facility  million  in current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

on december   the company entered into the second amendment to credit agreement to the credit facility second amendment 
the second amendment redetermined the borrowing base at million  limiting borrowing to the amount outstanding at december  in addition  interest rates were increased by increasing the range of the add on to the prime base rate by basis points on the lower end of the range and by basis points on the higher end of the range  the range of the add on to the alternative base rate was increased by the same amounts 
the credit facility is subject to semi annual borrowing base redeterminations on april and october of each year 
in addition to the scheduled semi annual borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders or the company have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time  provided that no party can request more than one such redetermination between the regularly scheduled borrowing base redeterminations 
the determination of our borrowing base is subject to a number of factors  including quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves  the banks price assumptions and other various factors unique to each member bank 
our lenders can redetermine the borrowing base to a lower level than the current borrowing base if they determine that our oil and natural gas reserves  at the time of redetermination  are inadequate to support the borrowing base then in effect 
in the event our then redetermined borrowing base is less than our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  we will be required to repay the deficit within a day period 
obligations under the credit facility are secured by pledges of outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and by a first priority lien on not less than in the case of an event of default of its present value of proved oil and natural gas properties 
in addition  the company is required to deliver to the lenders and maintain satisfactory title opinions covering not less than of the present value of proved oil and natural gas properties 
the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on cash dividends on common stock and under certain circumstances preferred stock  limitations on the redemption of preferred stock  limitations on repurchases of common stock  restrictions on incurrence of additional debt  and an unqualified audit report on the company s consolidated financial statements

capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in consisted of million for property and equipment additions related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  production facilities  and related drilling and workover activities and property acquisitions 
the company anticipates the capital spending budget will be primarily used for recompletions and similar work on existing properties  and for lease maintenance costs 
we anticipate that the budget will be significantly lower than in past years  reflecting our expectations of reduced cash flows due to commodity price declines and the loss of availability of funds under the credit facility 
these factors will significantly impact funds available for capital spending 
we currently anticipate funding the plan utilizing cash flow from operations and cash on hand  augmented by proceeds from sales of assets as possible

share repurchase program 
in march  the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program 
under the program  the company may repurchase in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions up to million worth of common shares per year over three years 
the timing  volume  and nature of share repurchases will be at the discretion of management  depending on market conditions  applicable securities laws  and other factors 
prior to implementing this program  the company was required to seek approval of the repurchase program from the lenders under the credit facility 
the repurchase program was approved by the lenders  subject to certain restrictive covenants 
during february  the lenders in the credit facility unanimously approved an amendment increasing the available limit for the company s repurchase of its common stock from million to million annually 
the amendment contained restrictive covenants on the company s ability to repurchase its common stock including i the company cannot utilize funds under the credit facility to fund any stock repurchases and ii immediately prior to any repurchase  availability under the credit facility must be equal to at least of the then effective borrowing base 
as of december   availability under the credit facility was less than the required  and repurchases have been suspended 
as of december   the company had repurchased  common shares at a cost of  of which  shares have been issued for k contributions  for contract services  and for compensation 
the program does not require the company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
the company does not expect to make share repurchases in the near term 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
reserve estimates significantly impact depletion and potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and natural gas revenues  bad debts  oil and natural gas properties  derivative contracts  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties 
all costs incurred with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
included in capitalized costs are general and administrative costs that are directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
for the years   and  such capitalized costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 

table of contents proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool  except in transactions involving a significant quantity of reserves or where the proceeds received from the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss would be recognized 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and are included in amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs 
the provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties is computed by the unit of production method 
under this computation  the total unamortized costs of oil and natural gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  excluding costs of unproved properties  are divided by the total estimated units of proved oil and natural gas reserves at the beginning of the period to determine the depletion rate 
this rate is multiplied by the physical units of oil and natural gas produced during the period 
changes in the quantities of our reserves could significantly impact the company s expense of depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties 
a decrease in reserves would have increased our expense for the year by approximately  however  a increase in our reserves would have decreased our expense for the year by approximately 
the cost of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties not subject to depletion is assessed quarterly to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining impairment  an evaluation is performed on current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and natural gas industry conditions  available geological and geophysical information  and actual exploration and development plans 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
at december   we had million allocated to unevaluated oil and natural gas properties 
a decrease in the unevaluated oil and natural gas properties balance would have increased our expense of depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties by less than and a increase would have decreased our provision by less than for the year ended december  full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarter  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future after tax net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
the calculation of the ceiling test and depletion expense are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify a revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
at december   the unamortized cost of our oil and natural gas properties  net of related deferred income taxes  exceeded the ceiling under the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
accordingly  based on december  pricing of per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil  in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a non cash impairment of million million after tax of the company s oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
a non cash impairment of million million after tax was recognized in the third quarter of  based on prices prevailing at that time 

table of contents due to the imprecision in estimating oil and natural gas revenues as well as the potential volatility in oil and natural gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance that write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
at december   we had no cushion ie  the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs 
thus  any decrease in prices affecting the end of subsequent accounting periods  net of the effect of our hedging positions  may require us to record additional impairment charges 
any future impairment would be impacted by changes in the accumulated costs of oil and natural gas properties  which may in turn be affected by sales or acquisitions of properties and additional capital expenditures 
future impairment would also be impacted by changes in estimated future net revenues  which are impacted by additions and revisions to oil and natural gas reserves 
a decrease in prices would have increased our non cash impairment expense by approximately million  or 
price risk management activities 
the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
cash flow hedge accounting for qualifying hedges allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the earnings statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  the company has entered into various derivative contracts 
these contracts allow the company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges as provided by sfas and any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item 
any changes in fair value resulting from the ineffectiveness of the hedge are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of revenues 
the company recognized a loss of  during the year ended december   a gain of  during the year ended december   and a gain of  during the year ended december  as of december   the estimated fair value of the company s oil and natural gas agreements was an unrealized gain of million million net of tax which is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
based upon oil and natural gas commodity prices at december   all of the unrealized gain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss could potentially increase gross revenues in the derivative agreements expire at various dates through december  net settlements under these contract agreements increased oil and natural gas revenues by   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional discussion of disclosures about market risk 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature 
table of contents of these short term instruments 
the fair value of bank borrowings under the credit facility approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and the rate is variable and had been recently renegotiated on december   in addition  the value of the underlying collateral is in excess of the outstanding amount 
the company also has a smaller bank debt with a fixed rate the rig note 
the fair value of the rig note  computed for disclosure purposes only  is estimated as million  the carrying value of the debt is million 
the fair value was estimated based on the fair value of the underlying collateral  which is a drilling rig owned by the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on how fair value for the rig was estimated  see note for further information on the credit facility and the rig note 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback carryforward period to absorb future deductible temporary differences or a carryforward 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  including such evidence as the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income 
as a result of the current assessment  in we recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets equal to the full amount of those assets

the company adopted the effective portion of sfas on january   the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not expect the adoption in of application of the new standard to non financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

the guidance will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we are evaluating the effect of eitf on our financial statements  we expect that certain of our outstanding warrants will be subject to derivative accounting  and we cannot predict the effect on our results of operations  as it is dependent on our stock price 
in december  the securities and exchange commission published a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new rule permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to a report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
the use of average prices will affect future impairment and depletion calculations 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reports on forms k for fiscal years ending on or after december  a company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required 
the company has not yet determined the impact of this final rule  which will vary depending on changes in commodity prices on its disclosures financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility 
since interest charged on borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility 

table of contents hedging contracts from time to time  meridian addresses market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into derivative agreements to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration 
the company s credit facility note requires that counterparties in derivative transactions be limited to the lenders  including affiliates of the lenders 
the company does not obtain collateral from the company s counterparties to support counterparty obligations under the agreements 
the master derivative contracts with each counterparty allow the company  so long as it is not a defaulting party  after a default or the occurrence of a termination event  to set off against the interest of the counterparty in any outstanding balance under the credit facility 
in practice  no such set off has been made  and all settlements have been made in cash 
as of december   however  the company is in default of two covenants contained in the credit facility  the breach of which is also a default under the master derivative agreements 
the company s hedge counterparties are not obligated to make payments to the company under the hedging agreements while the company s default is continuing 
the company s set off rights under the master derivative agreements cannot be exercised due to such default 
the company s hedging counterparties may exercise their remedies under the hedging agreements  and potentially under the credit facility  on account of the company s default 
if a counterparty were to default in payment of an obligation  the company would be exposed to commodity price fluctuations  and the protection intended by the hedge would be lost 
the value of assets from hedging activities would be impacted 
in addition  as expected cash flows from hedging contracts are included in computing future net revenues  the ceiling test could be impacted  which could result in a non cash write down of oil and natural gas properties 
balances owed by the company under derivative agreements are collateralized by the security interests supporting the credit facility 
the agreements also contain provisions permitting netting of multiple unrelated transactions that settle on the same day and in the same currency 
all of the company s current hedging agreements are in the form of costless collars 
the costless collars provide the company with a lower limit floor price and an upper limit ceiling price on the hedged volumes 
the floor price represents the lowest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes while the ceiling price represents the highest price the company will receive for the hedged volumes 
the costless collars are settled monthly based on the nymex futures contract 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of the company during the periods presented 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our proved developed natural gas production and of our proved developed oil production during the respective terms of the hedging agreements 
the fair values of the hedges are based on the difference between the strike price and the nymex future prices for the applicable trading months 
the fair values of our hedging agreements are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the estimated fair value of our hedging agreements as of december   is provided below see the company s website at www
