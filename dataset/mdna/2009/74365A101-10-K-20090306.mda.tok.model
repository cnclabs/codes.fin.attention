restatement on february   our management concluded  with the concurrence of the audit committee of our board of directors to amend and restate our financial statements for the year ended december   and each of the fiscal quarters of we have restated our consolidated balance sheet at december   statements of operations  changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for the year ended december  to change the accounting treatment of certain stock based compensation of non employees required by sfas r  share based payment  or sfas r  for certain transactions with nonemployees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
all amendments and restatements to the financial statements affected are non cash in nature 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment  or sfas r  requires the use of the fair value based method to measure the value of stock based compensation 
in our application of sfas r  we took the position that an active market for our common stock did not exist for the first quarter of  and that better information existed for the first and third quarters of  due to the limited public float and trading volume in the market 
we used alternative valuation methods to calculate the fair value of the common stock underlying certain stock based compensation awards granted to non employees during the first and third quarters of the alternative valuation methods included a retrospective valuation conducted by a third party specialist in the first quarter  and for the third quarter we had used the public offering price of the shares of our common stock sold in the underwritten public offering completed by us on october  for purposes of the second quarter of  we used the traded market value of the common stock to calculate the fair value of the common stock underlying certain stock based compensation awards granted to non employees because we did not believe that there was a preferred  alternative valuation mechanism available for that quarter 
however  we concluded that we must rely on the traded market value of the common stock for the first and third quarters of we recalculated the compensation expense for non employees for the first and third quarters of based on the traded market price of the common stock on the applicable measurement dates and determined that the resulting increase to the compensation expense for the applicable periods was material 
on that basis  we recommended to the audit committee that a restatement is required 
sfas r requires that share based transactions with nonemployees to be measured based on the fair value of the goods or services received or the fair value of the equity instruments  whichever is more reliably measurable 
eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  specifies that the measurement date for such share based transactions should be the earlier of a performance commitment  or the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete 
we had previously issued  shares of equity instruments stock options and restricted common stock whose terms indicated that performance was not complete until the applicable vesting requirements were fulfilled 
accordingly  the measurement of the share based compensation expense was determined based on the fair value of those equity instruments at each quarterly vesting date 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements for the first and third quarters of  we utilized a fair value of our common stock of and per share  respectively 
the reported traded prices of our common stock on the nyse alternext us were and at the end of the first and third quarters of  respectively 
we subsequently concluded that we should have used the reported traded prices as the valuation methodology for those equity instruments 
accordingly  we have restated the amounts previously reported for share based compensation 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our proprietary procellex tm protein expression system 
using our procellex system  we are developing a pipeline of proprietary and biosimilar or generic versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our plant cell based expression technology that target large  established pharmaceutical markets and that rely upon known biological mechanisms of action 
our initial commercial focus has been on complex therapeutic proteins  including proteins for the treatment of 
table of contents genetic disorders  such as gaucher disease and fabry disease 
we believe our procellex protein expression system will enable us to develop proprietary recombinant proteins that are therapeutically equivalent or superior to existing recombinant proteins currently marketed for the same indications 
because we are primarily targeting biologically equivalent versions of highly active  well tolerated and commercially successful therapeutic proteins  we believe our development process is associated with relatively less risk compared to other biopharmaceutical development processes for completely novel therapeutic proteins 
our lead product development candidate is prgcd for the treatment of gaucher disease  which we are developing using our procellex protein expression system 
gaucher disease is a rare and serious lysosomal storage disorder with severe and debilitating symptoms 
prgcd is our proprietary recombinant form of glucocerebrosidase gcd  an enzyme naturally found in human cells that is mutated or deficient in patients with gaucher disease 
in july  we reached an agreement with the united states food and drug administration  or the fda  on the final design of our pivotal phase iii clinical trial of prgcd  through the fda s special protocol assessment spa process 
we completed enrollment of patients in the phase iii clinical trial in december and expect to report results of the clinical trial in the second half of we anticipate submitting a new drug application nda for prgcd to the fda and other comparable regulatory agencies in other countries in the fourth quarter of in addition to our phase iii clinical trial  we initiated  during the third quarter of  a double blind  follow on extension study as part of our phase iii clinical trial 
in december  we also initiated a clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching gaucher patients currently treated under the current standard of care to treatment with prgcd 
the current standard of care for gaucher patients is enzyme replacement therapy with cerezyme which is produced by genzyme corporation and currently the only approved enzyme replacement therapy for gaucher disease 
enzyme replacement therapy is a medical treatment in which recombinant enzymes are injected into patients in whom the enzyme is lacking or dysfunctional 
the switch over study is not a prerequisite for approval of prgcd 
although gaucher disease is a relatively rare disease  it represents a large commercial market due to the severity of the symptoms and the chronic nature of the disease 
the annual worldwide sales of cerezyme were approximately billion in according to public reports by genzyme 
prgcd is a plant cell expressed version of the gcd enzyme  developed through our procellex protein expression system 
prgcd has an amino acid  glycan and three dimensional structure that is very similar to its naturally produced counterpart as well as to cerezyme  which is a mammalian cell expressed version of the same protein 
we believe prgcd may prove more cost effective than the currently marketed alternative due to the cost benefits of expression through our procellex protein expression system 
in addition  based on our laboratory testing  preclinical and clinical results  we believe that prgcd may have the potential for increased potency and efficacy compared to the existing enzyme replacement therapy for gaucher disease  which may translate into lower dosages and or less frequent treatments 
in addition to prgcd  we are developing an innovative product pipeline using our procellex protein expression system 
our product pipeline currently includes  among other candidates  therapeutic protein candidates for the treatment of fabry disease  a rare  genetic lysosomal disorder in humans  an acetylcholinesterase enzyme based therapy for biodefense and intoxication treatments and an additional undisclosed therapeutic protein  all of which are currently being evaluated in animal studies 
we plan to file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda with respect to at least one additional product during and to initiate human clinical studies immediately thereafter 
we believe that we may be able to reduce the development risks and time to market for our product candidates as our product candidates are based on well understood proteins with known biological mechanisms of actions 
we hold the worldwide commercialization rights to our proprietary development candidates and we intend to establish an internal  commercial infrastructure and targeted sales force to market prgcd and our other products  if approved  in north america  the european union and in other significant markets  including israel 
in addition we are continuously evaluating potential strategic marketing partnerships 
our business is conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  protalix ltd  which we acquired through a reverse merger transaction effective december  the merger transaction was treated as a recapitalization for accounting purposes and  as such  the results of operations discussed below are those of protalix ltd 
prior to the merger transaction  we had not conducted any operations for several years 
protalix ltd 
was originally incorporated in israel in december since its inception in december  protalix ltd 
has generated significant losses in connection with its research and development  including the clinical development of prgcd 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since we do not generate revenue from any of our product candidates  we expect to continue to generate losses in connection with the continued clinical development of prgcd and the research and development activities relating to our technology and other drug candidates 
such research and development activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  we believe that our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
we will need to obtain additional funds for the commercialization of our lead product  prgcd  and to further develop the research and clinical development of our other programs 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report 
we believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which we prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate such estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
functional currency the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
as a development stage company with no significant source of revenues  we considered the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
most of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
research and development expense we expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research and development activities  payments made to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in research and development  activities relating to the advancement of product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
the following table identifies our current major research and development projects project status expected near term milestone prgcd for the treatment of gaucher disease phase iii results of phase iii in second half of prx alpha galactosidase enzyme research pre clinical during acetylcholinesterase research ind application during all of our projects  other than our phase iii clinical trial of prgcd  are in the research phase with relatively immaterial costs 
most of our research and development costs were incurred in connection with our phase iii clinical trial of prgcd 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across all of our projects 
we currently do not record and maintain research and development costs per project 
the costs and expenses of our projects are partially funded by grants we have received from the ocs 
each grant is deducted from the related research and development expenses as the costs are incurred 
for additional information regarding the grant process  see business israeli government programs encouragement of industrial research and development law  in item of this annual report 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
at this time  due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development processes and given the early stage of our preclinical product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of the product candidates in our pipeline for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently 
table of contents focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
see risk factors all of our product candidates other than prgcd are in research stages 
if we are unable to develop and commercialize our other product candidates  our business will be adversely affected and we may not obtain the necessary us or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize our drug candidates in a timely manner  if at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue the advancement of our clinical trials and preclinical product development programs 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in generating product revenue and cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if our phase iii clinical trial or prgcd produces favorable results  we expect to file a new drug application  an nda  for prgcd with the fda in the last quarter of because of the factors set forth above  we are not able to estimate with any certainty when we would recognize any net cash inflows from our projects 
see risk factors clinical trials are very expensive  time consuming and difficult to design and implement and may result in unforeseen costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including share based compensation expense  for persons serving as our executive  finance  accounting and administration functions 
other general and administrative expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  costs associated with industry and trade shows and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we add additional personnel and continue to comply with the reporting and other obligations applicable to public companies in the united states 
from inception in december through december   we have spent million on general and administrative expense  including share based compensation expense of million for options granted to employees and consultants 
financial expense and income financial expense and income consists of the following interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  interest expense on short term bank credit and loan  and expense or income resulting from fluctuations of the new israeli shekel nis  in which a portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated  against the united states dollar and other foreign currencies 
share based compensation the discussion below regarding share based compensation relates to share based compensation paid by protalix ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary 
we apply emerging issue task force  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf  with respect to options granted in consideration of services performed by consultants 
in accordance with eitf  we record the benefit of any grant to a non employee and remeasure the benefit in any future vesting period for the unvested portion of the grants  as applicable 
in addition  we use the straight line accounting method for recording the benefit of the entire grant  unlike the graded method we use to record grants made to employees 
we apply sfas r which requires measurement of share based compensation cost for all share based awards at the fair value on the grant date and recognition of share based compensation over the service period for awards that we expect will vest 
the fair value of stock options is determined based on the number of shares granted and the price of our ordinary shares  and calculated based on the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we recognize such value as expense over the service period  
table of contents net of estimated forfeitures  using the accelerated method under sfas r 
the cumulative effect of our adoption of sfas r  as of january   was not material 
protalix ltd 
had multiple classes of stock before the conversion of all preferred shares into ordinary shares in september through december   protalix ltd 
considered the three commonly used methods described by the american institute of certified public accountants  or the aicpa  practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  and determined that the probability weighted expected return method is the appropriate method to value its securities 
we chose this method because it is forward looking and incorporates future economic events and outcomes into the determination of value at the time of calculation 
the method is limited  as are all forward looking methods  in that it relies on a number of assumptions 
under the probability weighted expected return method  the value of the ordinary shares of protalix ltd 
is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for the enterprise assuming various future outcomes 
share value is based upon the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns  considering each of the possible future outcomes available to the enterprise  as well as the rights of each share class 
although the future outcomes considered in any given valuation model will vary based upon the enterprise s facts and circumstances  common future outcomes modeled might include an initial public offering  merger or sale  dissolution or continued operation as a viable private enterprise 
the probability weighted expected return method analysis presents value afforded to shareholders under four possible scenarios 
three of the scenarios assume a shareholder realization  either through an initial public offering  sale  merger or liquidation 
the last scenario assumes operations continue as a private company and no realization transaction occurs 
fair value calculations of the ordinary shares of protalix ltd 
were performed for dates close to the dates on which preferred shares were issued to third parties 
we considered the issuance price of each series of preferred shares to third parties in the calculation of the fair value of the ordinary shares 
for each of the first three realization scenarios  estimated future and present values for each of the share classes were calculated utilizing assumptions which consisted of the following expected pre money value at the realization date  standard deviation around the above pre money value  expected date of the realization scenario occurring  standard deviation around the expected realization scenario occurrence date in days  and an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
for purposes of determining the fair value of the options and shares of restricted common stock granted to employees and non employees during the fiscal year ended december   including shares held by non employees that vested during such period  our management used the fair value of our common stock which was the closing sale price of our common stock on the nyse alternext us llc on the date of calculation 
sfas r allows companies to estimate the expected term of the option rather than simply using the contractual term of an option 
because of lack of data on past option exercises by employees  the expected term of the options could not be based on historic exercise patterns 
accordingly  we adopted the simplified method as stipulated in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment sab  according to which companies may calculate the expected term as the average between the vesting date and the expiration date  assuming the option was granted as a plain vanilla option 
sab defines plain vanilla share options as those having the following characteristics share options are granted at the money  exercisability is conditional only on performing service through the vesting date  if an employee terminates service prior to vesting  the employee forfeits the share options  if an employee terminates service after vesting  the employee has a limited period of time typically days to exercise the share options  and share options are nontransferable and nonhedgeable 
all of the outstanding options granted by protalix ltd 
were granted at an exercise price that was lower than the then share price 
accordingly  we assumed that the exercise period will on average be shorter than the average period between the vesting and the expiration of the options 
however  due to the lack of information regarding exercise behavior  we implemented the methodology proposed above for the calculation of the expected term for all grants including those that were in the money 

table of contents in performing the valuation  we assumed an expected dividend yield in the previous years and in the next years 
we do not have a dividend policy and given our development stage  dividends are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all 
sfas r stipulates a number of factors that should be considered when estimating the expected volatility  including the implied volatility of traded options  historical volatility and the period that the shares of the company are being publicly traded 
as we do not have any traded shares or options  the expected volatility figures used in this valuation have been calculated by using the historical volatility of traded shares of similar companies 
in addition  we examined the standard deviation of shares of similar biotechnology companies that engage in research and development  generally in the development stage 
we found that the standard deviation of the shares of comparable companies was in the range of over periods of three to six years 
the volatility used for each grant differed based on its expected term 
for the term of each grant of our options  the historical volatility was calculated based upon the overall trading history of the common stock of comparable companies 
the risk free interest rate in the table above has been based on the implied yield of us federal reserve zero coupon government bonds 
the remaining term of the bonds used for each valuation was equal to the expected term of the grant 
this methodology has been applied to all grants valued by us 
sfas r requires the use of a risk free interest rate based on the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed  with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option being valued 
this requirement has been applied for all grants valued as part of this report 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues no revenues were recorded during the years ended december  or research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the increase of million in development expenses related to salaries for personnel involved in research and development and million in related subcontractors and consultants expenses  mainly in connection with our on going phase iii clinical trial of prgcd 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by the recognition of grants equal to million from the ocs during  an increase of approximately million compared to the recognition of grants equal to million during we expect research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense as we enter into a more advanced stage of clinical trials for our product candidates  especially with respect to the anticipated continued progress in our phase iii clinical trial for prgcd

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since our inception 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds equal to million from the sale of shares of our common stock and from sales of convertible preferred and ordinary shares of protalix ltd  and an additional million in connection with the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the sale of such ordinary shares  through december  in addition  on october   we generated gross proceeds of million in connection with an underwritten public offering of our common stock 
we believe that the funds currently available to us as are sufficient to satisfy our capital needs for approximately the next months 
the following table summarizes our past funding sources security year number of shares amount ordinary shares series a convertible preferred shares series b convertible preferred shares series c convertible preferred shares ordinary shares common stock gross proceeds  does not include proceeds from warrant exercises 
includes the issuance of ordinary shares to founders

future funding requirements we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur increasing research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and the advancement of our additional pipeline of product candidate into the various clinical trials 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff  add infrastructure  and incur additional costs related to the preparation of the company to its commercial phase for its lead product candidate  prgcd 
in addition  we are considering a new manufacturing facility that would meet the fda requirements for the manufacture of our product candidates  which would increase our capital expenditures significantly  the first phase of which has commenced in january and estimated to cost approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for approximately the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that are subject to change and may prove to be wrong  and we may be required to use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials  costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution and whether these efforts will be performed internally or through some form of collaboration with third parties  the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development  and laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue 
we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we currently do not have any commitments for future external funding 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate 
we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional equity or debt financing  grants or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our 
table of contents planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
effects of inflation and currency fluctuations inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or currency fluctuations could affect us by increased or decreased costs mainly for goods and services acquired outside of israel 
we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of certain contingent royalty payments

ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than its parent company are required to be presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent company s equity 
sfas requires that changes in a parent company s ownership interest while the parent company retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for in a manner similar to the accounting treatment of equity transactions 
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary should be initially measured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas requires consolidated net income to be reported in amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent company and the noncontrolling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statement  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to both parent companies and the noncontrolling interests 
sfas is effective for fiscal years including interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas is required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirement which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange risk the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
we are currently in the development stage with no significant source of revenues  therefore we consider the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
approximately of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
since the dollar is the functional currency  monetary items maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates and non monetary items are remeasured at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expense items are remeasured at the average rate of exchange in effect during the period in which they occur 
foreign currency translation gains or losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
approximately of our costs  including salaries  expenses and office expenses  are incurred in new israeli shekels  the nis 
inflation in israel may have the effect of increasing the us dollar cost of our operations in israel 
if the us dollar declines in value in relation to the nis  it will become more expensive for us to fund our operations in israel 
a revaluation of of the nis will affect our income before tax by less than 
the exchange rate of the us dollar to the nis  based on exchange rates published by the bank of israel  was as follows year ended december  average rate for period rate at year end to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the nis 
these measures  however  may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in israel 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all short term  highly liquid investments  which include short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase  that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash  to be cash equivalents 
the 
table of contents primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the interest income we receive from our investments  without increasing risk 
we invest any cash balances primarily in bank deposits and investment grade interest bearing instruments 
we are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to interest rate risk 
our interest gains may decline in the future as a result of changes in the financial markets
