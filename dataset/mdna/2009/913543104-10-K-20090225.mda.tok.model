item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information required by this item is incorporated by reference from the annual report under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists of a revolving credit facility and industrial development revenue bonds 
we do not currently use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we would be required to refinance it 
on december   the estimated fair value of our long term debt  including the current portion  was million  which was million greater than the carrying value 
the estimated fair value is based on rates anticipated to be available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of notes payable included in current liabilities and the revolving credit facility approximated the carrying values 
expected cash flows over the next five years related to debt instruments are as follows us equivalents  in thousands thereafter total long term debt fixed rate us average interest rate variable rate us average interest rate average of rates at december
