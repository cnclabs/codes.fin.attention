overview we design  develop and support core system software  operating system software and application software for personal computers and other computing devices 
our css products  which are commonly referred to as firmware  support and enable the compatibility  connectivity  security and manageability of the various components and technologies used in such devices  while our operating system and application software enable specific device functionality and enhanced device performance 
we sell our css products primarily to computer and component device manufacturers and we also provide these customers with training  consulting  maintenance and engineering services 
we generally sell our operating system and application software to these same manufacturers  but we also make direct sales of these products  over the internet  to the end users of these devices 
in the early s  we established industry leadership by pioneering the design of the basic input output system bios  an early form of css that runs on most computing devices immediately after the device is powered on  during the period usually referred to as boot time 
today  the substantial majority of our revenues still come from our css brands  which include the securecore tm  trustedcore tm  awardcore tm  microcore tm and embeddedbios products 
we design  develop  market  sell and support css products that initialize the chips and 
table of contents other components which are built into computing and communications devices and load the primary operating system in order to fully enable the operation of the device 
we license our software products directly to the world s leading pc oems and odms  who incorporate these products during the device manufacturing process 
we also design  develop and support operating system software for pcs and other similar devices 
hyperspace tm  our operating system software  is a technology that significantly reduces the boot time of a pc by providing instant on capabilities and conserves battery life  particularly of portable computers  thereby creating a significantly improved user experience 
our hypercore tm product incorporates virtualization technologies which create or support second  third or subsequent virtual machines environments which enable multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a single computer 
our phoenix flip tm product is a css plug in technology that enables a device user to switch easily between two different operating systems on a single device by suspending one system and resuming the other in a short period of time 
we believe our operating system software provides users of personal computers and particularly portable computers with enhanced device utility  reliability and security as well as with the ability to utilize specific applications such as web browsers  messaging suites  office suites and media suites that are purpose built for the mobile device 
in addition to operating systems and virtualization software  we design  develop and support a number of applications in house and we also resell other companies application software 
we also provide application developers with software development kits that enable them to build or customize applications to perform optimally within our operating systems 
we also offer software and services that assist users with the management and security of computing devices 
failsafe  one of our software products sold as a service  is an advanced theft loss protection system that has functionality to assist in preventing a device from being lost or stolen as well as tools to protect the data on a lost or stolen device 
the user can retrieve  encrypt  lock and even destroy data on a lost or stolen device to protect sensitive and private information 
we also sell a simplified version of failsafe called phoenix freeze tm which locks a user s computer when the user s bluetooth enabled mobile phone leaves a user defined area monitored by freeze 
when the user moves back into the range of the computer  freeze automatically unlocks the system 
finally we offer esupport  a suite of products and services generally delivered over the internet which help users keep their computing devices both well tuned and fully up to date for drivers and operating system s registry 
the majority of our revenues currently come from css products 
our newer products  which include hyperspace  hypercore  flip  failsafe  freeze and esupport  currently provide less than ten percent of our revenues but we expect these new products to contribute a larger proportion of our revenues in future periods 
although the true consumers of the products and services that we offer are enterprises  governments and individuals  we typically sell these products through our oems  odms or service provider channels to enable brand managers  system designers and manufacturers across the entire pc industry to differentiate their systems  reduce time to market and thereby increase their revenues 
in addition to licensing our products to oem and odm customers  we also sell certain of our products directly or indirectly to computer end users or support organizations through web based delivery 
we derive additional revenues from providing development tools and support services such as customization  training  maintenance and technical support to our software customers and to various development partners 
our revenues therefore arise from three sources license fees revenues arising from agreements that license our system and application software and other intellectual property rights to third parties 
primary license fee sources include a 
css  system firmware development platforms  firmware agents and firmware run time licenses  b 
software development kits and software development tools  c 
device driver software  d 
embedded operating system software  and e 
embedded application software

fiscal year overview the fiscal year ended september  represents the third full fiscal year of the company s execution of new strategic and operational plans developed by the company s management team  led by president and chief executive officer woody hobbs 
these plans  as discussed regularly by us in various public statements  called for restoring the company s core business to positive cash flow within the first year and announcing major new products early in the second year 
having initially achieved these objectives  we informed investors in various public statements that we would now focus on building out industry partnerships to integrate our new products with the offerings of other hardware and software vendors and on expanding our research and development efforts to assist in these integration initiatives 
our fiscal year was a challenging one as the global economic downturn and turbulence in the domestic and international financial markets weighed heavily on our customers 
the financial results for the year were negatively affected by the slowdown in global economic activity for most of the year 
we experienced the effects of the crisis in the form of substantial reduction in the overall business conducted by our oem and odm customers that contribute the majority of our traditional css license business 
as a result of the aforementioned slow down in the global economy  combined with a reduction in product pricing across the personal computers pc ecosystem  our revenue for fiscal year ended september  was million  which represents a decrease of million  or  from million reported for fiscal year this reduction was largely driven by a decline in our traditional css license business  partially offset by the growth in our new and emerging products and services 
specifically  we experienced a decline in our license revenue as a result of a decline in our average selling prices and cautious spending by our large oem and odm customers  resellers and system integrators  which we believe reflected both reduced end user demand and related inventory reductions in the global pc supply chain  as well as the loss of two of our key customers in the japan region  partially offset by the addition of certain new css license customers 
in response to the challenging global economic environment  management took significant steps to reduce overall operating costs and to drive higher efficiencies throughout the company 
these steps included implementing restructuring decisions to reduce expenses  eliminate overlapping functions and employees not meeting company performance expectations and closing the company s facility in tel aviv  israel 
in addition  management announced the closure of the company s facility in hyderabad  india and shanghai  china in order to consolidate development activities in the company s other locations 
primarily as a result of these restructuring activities  the effects of which were partially offset by other workforce additions during the year  we reduced our global workforce by employees  representing approximately of our global workforce at september  we recorded approximately million in charges associated with our restructuring plans during fiscal  which compares to million recorded during the prior fiscal year associated mainly with the true up adjustments in relation to the restructuring plans announced during fiscal year see note restructuring and asset impairment charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s restructuring plans 
while the longer term impacts of the current economic uncertainty are hard to predict  we remain committed to our product strategies  which are designed to enable us to achieve revenue growth in excess of the growth rate of the overall pc industry in future periods 
we have invested in  built and marketed our new technologies successfully and our pc tm architecture now spans mobile and personal computing  as well as many consumer devices 
our new product strategy has already begun to produce results as we started recognizing revenue from the sale of our flagship products  hyperspace and failsafe  as both of them received wide industry acclaim and acceptance by major oems and odms 
encouraged by the favorable reaction of our major customers to our pc tm vision  
table of contents which includes ease of use  virtualization and mobile data security as key features  throughout the year we continued to make selective investments in our new product initiatives and businesses despite the market slowdown 
as compared to fiscal year  we increased our spending in research and development and sales and marketing by approximately and  respectively  while at the same time  we reduced general and administrative costs by approximately through deployment of new cost management initiatives 
as a result of the above and mainly due to the charges of million associated with the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets discussed below  our total expenditures including operating expenses and cost of revenues for fiscal year increased by million  or  to million as compared to total expenditures of million recorded for fiscal year during fiscal year  we used net cash of million in operating activities as compared to positive net cash flow from operations of million during fiscal year during the second quarter of current fiscal year  based on a combination of factors  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis and to also assess the impairment of other long lived assets 
these factors included the rapid deterioration of global economic conditions  our operating results including the reduction in force and other cost reduction initiatives discussed in note restructuring and asset impairment charges  a substantial and sustained decline in our market capitalization  and management s decisions to prioritize allocation of resources and to discontinue investments in certain products and services 
based on the analysis performed  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for goodwill and million with respect to other long lived intangible assets during the current fiscal year 
in addition  we recorded amortization of intangible assets  to the extent not considered impaired  amounting to million 
while there were no such impairment charges in the prior fiscal year  the company had recorded amortization charges aggregating to million in fiscal year stock based compensation expense for the current fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million recorded for the prior fiscal year stock based compensation for the current year as well as part of the prior fiscal year includes expenses recognized in respect of stock options granted to our four most senior executives as approved by the company s stockholders on january  the performance options 
amortization of expense associated with the performance options began during the quarter ended march  and the total expense that was recognized from these options during fiscal year was million of this total  million was classified as general and administrative expense  million was classified as research and development expense and million was classified as sales and marketing expense 
amortization of the expenses associated with these options decreased by million  or  to million during the current fiscal year of this total  million is classified as general and administrative expense  million is classified as research and development expense and million is classified as sales and marketing expense 
during fiscal years  and  we executed a number of significant long term volume purchase agreements vpas with several of our major customers 
we consider the unbilled portion of these vpa commitments  along with deferred revenues  as our total order backlog 
during fiscal year  our total order backlog decreased by million  or  from million at september  to million at september  this decline is principally related to the fact that during the december period  we had executed a number of vpas with terms which extended for periods of up to months 
we expect to invoice and recognize this million as revenue over the future periods  however uncertainties such as the timing of customer utilization of our products may impact the timing of recognition for these revenues 
primarily as a result of actions taken under fiscal year restructuring plans  we reduced our total workforce from employees at september  and employees at june  to employees at september  however  we continued to recruit additional personnel  particularly into our research and development and customer engineering  and sales and marketing departments 
total revenues for fiscal year ended september  decreased by million  or  to million  from million for fiscal year this reduction was largely driven by a decline in our traditional css license business partially offset by the growth in our new and emerging products and services 
gross margin for fiscal year ended september  was million  a million or decrease from gross margin of million for fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  gross margin for fiscal year 
table of contents declined to as compared to in fiscal year the overall decrease in gross margin was primarily due to the million of impairment charges and million increase in amortization charges recorded on the purchased intangible assets as described above and partially from direct costs associated with service fees revenue where gross margin declined slightly from in fiscal year to in the current fiscal year the above decreases were partially offset by higher gross margin of generated from subscription fee revenues in fiscal year as compared to negative gross margin during fiscal year gross margin related to license revenue remained flat at during fiscal year as they were for the prior fiscal year operating expenses for fiscal year ended september  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal year of the million increase  i million was due to the impairment charge for goodwill  ii million and million was due to increase in research and development and sales and marketing expenses  respectively  and iii million was due to higher restructuring costs 
the above increases were partially offset by a million decrease in general and administrative expenses which resulted from various cost management initiatives and a reduction in the stock based compensation charges associated with the performance options 
during fiscal year  net interest and other income expenses decreased by million  to a net expenditure of  for the year ended september   a decrease of from the net interest and other income of million earned during fiscal year our tax expenses for fiscal year at million were lower by million  or  from the tax expense of million recorded during fiscal year the decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to a million decline in net interest income due to reduction in both interest rates and invested cash balances which was partially offset by million decrease in net foreign exchange losses related mainly to appreciation of the us dollar to the new taiwan dollar and other international currencies to which the company has exposure 
the decrease of million in tax expense is related to a reduction of the foreign and state income tax provision of million  a reduction of foreign withholding taxes of million  a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to the impairment of goodwill of million and an increase in the estimated r d credit refund of million 
we incurred a net loss of million for fiscal year ended september   compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year as described above  this million increase in net loss was principally the result of the million reduction in revenue  a million increase in cost of revenues  a million increase in operating expenses and a million decrease in interest and other income expenses  which was partially offset by million decrease in income tax expense

total revenues in fiscal year decreased by million  or  compared with fiscal year revenues for fiscal year for most regions  with the exception of taiwan and japan  increased over fiscal year the increase in revenue in fiscal year by for the north america region is primarily attributable to generation of subscription fee revenues  which resulted from the acquisitions we completed in the second half of fiscal year and revenue attributed to a new customer in fiscal year partially offset by lower shipment to other customers under vpa arrangements 
the increase in revenue by for the europe region is due to success of our initiative to convert a large customer who previously had the benefit of fully paid license arrangement  which generated marginal revenues during fiscal year ended september   to a vpa pay as you go arrangement where the revenue is generated for the each unit of license consumed by the customer 
the increase in revenue in fiscal year by for the other asian countries is primarily due to greater shipments to a vpa customer within the region 
the decline in revenue from taiwan in fiscal year is mainly due to reduced revenue from our large odm customers which resulted from reduced end user demand for pcs and inventory reductions in the global pc supply chain mainly in connection with the weakening global economic environment and from a decrease in our average selling prices 
the decrease in revenue from japan by is principally due to the loss of two significant customers in the japanese territory during fiscal year total revenues in fiscal year increased by million  or  compared with fiscal year revenues for fiscal year for most regions increased over fiscal year significant increases for most regions were attributable to recurring revenues associated with vpa and similar licenses  including revenues from customers who had generated little or no revenues in the prior period as a result of having previously purchased fully paid up licenses

we consider the unbilled portion of these vpa commitments  along with deferred revenues  as our total order backlog 
during fiscal year  our total order backlog decreased by million  or  from million at september  to million at september  this decline is principally related to the fact that during the december period  we had executed a number of vpas with terms which extended for periods of up to months 
we expect to invoice and recognize this million as revenue over the future periods  however uncertainties such as the timing of customer utilization of our products may impact the timing of recognition for these revenues

when the reserve was first established in the fourth quarter of fiscal  it had a liability balance of million which was comprised of a projected cash outflow of approximately million less a projected cash inflow of approximately million  though the reserve was later increased by million as the result of a change in estimated expenses 
the source of the cash inflow is a sublease of the facility that the company had vacated  and the sublease was executed as anticipated 
since the projected cash inflows exceed the projected cash outflows for the remaining period of the lease  the net balance is classified as an asset rather than a liability

table of contents during the second quarter of current fiscal year  based on a combination of factors  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis and to also assess the impairment of other long lived assets 
these factors included the rapid deterioration of global economic conditions  our operating results including the reduction in force and other cost reduction initiatives discussed in note restructuring and asset impairment charges  a substantial and sustained decline in our market capitalization  and management s decisions to prioritize allocation of resources and to discontinue investments in certain products and services 
based on the analysis performed  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million for goodwill during the current fiscal year 
no further goodwill impairment charges were required as a result of the annual impairment test performed at september  further  there was no such impairment charge recorded during fiscal years and interest and other income expenses  net net interest and other income expenses for fiscal years  and were as follows in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended september  change change interest and other income expenses  net percent of consolidated revenue net interest and other income expenses were approximately  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net interest and other income expenses consists mostly of interest income  which is primarily derived from cash and cash equivalents  foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  losses gains on disposal of assets  interest expenses and other miscellaneous expenses income 
during fiscal year  net interest and other income expenses decreased by million  to a net expenditure of  for the year ended september   a decrease of from the net interest and other income of million earned during fiscal year the decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to a million decline in net interest income due to reduction in both interest rates and invested cash balances which was partially offset by million decrease in net foreign exchange losses related mainly to appreciation of the us dollar to the new taiwan dollar and other international currencies to which the company has exposure 
the interest income generated each period is highly dependent on available cash and fluctuations in interest rates 
the average interest rate earned was approximately   and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
all cash equivalents and marketable securities are us dollar denominated 
to reduce administrative costs and liquidity risks  we sold all of our marketable securities in fiscal year and invested the proceeds in money market funds 
net interest income was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net gains losses on currency translations were approximately  million and million  in fiscal years  and  respectively  while net losses on disposal of assets and other miscellaneous expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net interest and other income expenses decreased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  principally due to lower interest rates earned during the year 
income tax expense income tax expense for fiscal years  and were as follows in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended september  change change income tax expense percent of consolidated revenue 
table of contents we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million reflecting effective tax rates of   and in fiscal years  and  respectively  and representing primarily foreign withholding taxes and estimated taxes related to operations of foreign subsidiaries 
we recorded income tax expense of million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from the expense of million recorded for fiscal year this decrease is related to a reduction of the foreign and state income tax provision of million  a reduction of foreign withholding taxes of million  a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to the impairment of goodwill of million and an increase in the estimated r d credit refund of million 
income tax expense for fiscal year is comprised primarily of million of foreign income taxes and million of foreign withholding taxes  adjusted for the estimated r d credit refund offset by reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to the impairment of goodwill aggregating to approximately million 
of the million income tax expense for fiscal year  million was attributable to the increase in liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
the liabilities for uncertain tax positions are primarily related to an ongoing dispute with the taxing authorities in taiwan on the allocation of expenses  and transfer pricing issues 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year was significantly different from the expected tax benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory rate to income before taxes  primarily due to foreign income taxes and withholding taxes assessed by foreign jurisdictions 
during fiscal year ended september   we recorded tax expense of million of which million is related to an increase in the tax accrual for a potential taiwanese transfer pricing adjustment 
we received notification in that the taiwan taxing authority disagrees with the transfer pricing used by us 
we are in the process of contesting the assessment notices we have received from the taiwan taxing authority 
we have therefore accrued but not paid the amount of the potential taiwanese tax liability related to the transfer pricing adjustment 
as of september   the balance of this reserve was million  of which million  million and million were added in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of september   we reclassified an amount of million to short term liability with the expectation of potential resolution relating to tax years to during fiscal year ended september   we submitted a proposal to the taiwan taxing authority for a re examination of the allocation of expenses under taiwanese transfer pricing guidelines for fiscal years through subsequent to september   we received final tax assessments from the taiwan taxing authority in respect of each of these years that are in accordance with the proposal submitted by management 
the assessments call for total tax and interest payments of approximately million  of which approximately million had previously been paid by the company 
accordingly  during the quarter ending december   we intend to make cash payments to the taiwan taxing authority totaling million in final settlement of our liabilities for taxes and related interest for these years 
in accordance with our policies regarding the accounting for uncertain tax positions  we had previously recorded tax and interest expenses totaling approximately million for the relevant years 
as a result of the final assessment of million  and the intended payment described above  we now expect to record a net reduction of tax expense relating to these years of approximately million in fiscal quarter ending december  deferred tax assets  which relate to both us and foreign taxes and tax credits  amounted to million at september  however  due to a history of losses  the deferred tax asset has been offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year was significantly different from the expected tax benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory rate to income before taxes  primarily due to foreign income taxes and withholding taxes assessed by foreign jurisdictions 
during fiscal year ended september   we recorded a tax 
table of contents expense of million of which million was related to the combination of taiwan withholding tax and an increase in the tax accrual for a potential taiwanese transfer pricing adjustment 
acquisitions we did not acquire any businesses in fiscal years and in fiscal year  we acquired three business entities 
see note business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information relating to these acquisitions 
although we have no current plans  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions  we expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to our business  which may require the use of cash 
future acquisitions could cause amortization expenses to increase 
in addition  if impairment events occur  they could also accelerate the timing of charges 
financial condition at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling million  compared to million at september  during fiscal year  cash decreased by million mainly as a result of million and million used in operating activities and investing activities  respectively 
these cash uses were partially offset by cash of million provided by financing activities and a million increase due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates 
cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and impairment of purchased intangible assets and goodwill aggregating to million offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities to the extent of million 
the net changes in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a million increase in deferred revenue mainly driven by higher prepayments received and lower revenue generated from our vpa arrangements and a million increase in income taxes payable related mainly to the company s foreign operations  which was partially offset by a million decrease in accrued compensation and related liabilities primarily due to payment of bonuses to employees based on the company s performance for fiscal year  a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities due to payments made to trade and other creditors prior to the end of fiscal  a million increase in prepaid expenses and royalties and other assets  a million decrease in liability associated with restructuring activities due to the periodic payment of related liabilities  and a million increase in accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities was due to purchases of property and equipment and other intangible assets of million and additional acquisitions related costs of million 
cash of million provided by financing activities was mainly due to the net proceeds of million from the issuance of  shares of common stock  par value per share to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the other increase was due to million of stock issuances under stock option and stock purchase plans  partially offset by repurchases of common stock in connection with restricted stock plans and principal payments made under capital lease obligations both aggregating to approximately million 
during fiscal year  cash decreased by million mainly as a result of investing activities totaling million which were composed of a million that we paid in cash net of cash acquired associated with the acquisition of beinsync ltd  b million that we paid in cash net of cash acquired associated with the acquisition of touchstone software corporation  c million that we paid in cash net of cash acquired associated with the acquisition of general software  inc  and d million for investment in property and equipment 
cash used in these investing activities was partly offset by million of cash provided by operating activities and million of cash provided by financing activities 
cash from operating activities resulted from a net loss of million which was offset by non cash charges of million for stock based compensation and million for depreciation and amortization as well as a million increase in taxes payable  a million increase in accounts receivable and a net million increase from other operating items 
cash from financing 
table of contents activities was due to the receipt of million from stock issuances under stock option and stock purchase plans offset by million paid for the repurchase of restricted common stock 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and the cash we expect to generate from future operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  there are a number of factors that could impact our liquidity position  including  but not limited to i current global economic conditions which affect demand for our products and services and impact the financial stability of our suppliers and customers  ii the recent tendency of customers to delay payments to manage their own liquidity positions  iii plans to further restructure our business and operations  and iv possible investments or acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  although we have no current plans  commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions 
it is also likely that we may continue to incur a net loss and negative net cash flow in fiscal year  particularly if we are unable to achieve the revenues we anticipate or if we are unable to effectively manage our cash expenditures 
commitments as of september   we had net commitments for million under non cancelable operating leases ranging from one to six years 
the operating lease obligations also include i the facility in norwood  massachusetts which has been fully vacated and for which the company entered into a sublease agreement in october for the remainder of the term  and ii the facility in milpitas  california  which has been partially vacated and for which the company entered into a sublease agreement in november further  as part of the restructuring activities carried out during fiscal year  we are committed to pay approximately million related to facilities and certain other exit costs 
see note restructuring and asset impairment charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s restructuring plans 
in addition  as of september   the company is committed to pay approximately million for the assets acquired under capital lease arrangements 
on september   our future lease commitments were as follows in thousands operating lease obligations fiscal years ending september  total minimum operating lease payments less sublease rentals net minimum operating lease payments 
table of contents capital lease obligations fiscal years ending september  total minimum capital lease payments less amount representing interest present value of net minimum capital lease payments as of september   the company had a non current income tax liability of million which was associated primarily with the accrual of income taxes on the company s operations in taiwan 
out of the total liability of million  an amount of million was related to fiscal years through during fiscal year ended september   management submitted a proposal to the taiwan taxing authority for a re examination of the allocation of expenses under taiwanese transfer pricing guidelines for fiscal years through subsequent to september   we received final tax assessments from the taiwan taxing authority in respect of each of these years that are in accordance with the proposal submitted by management 
the assessments call for total tax and interest payments of approximately million  of which approximately million had previously been paid by the company 
accordingly  during the quarter ending december   we intend to make cash payments to the taiwan taxing authority totaling million in final settlement of our liabilities for taxes and related interest for the years to see note subsequent events in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of any settlement of the remaining tax liability of million with the respective taxing authority  if any 
there were no material commitments for capital expenditures or non cancelable purchase commitments as of september  off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet agreements 
recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following represent the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and are subject to the various estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of such financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis and are also discussed by senior management with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including non recurring engineering  maintenance consisting of product support services and rights to unspecified updates on a when and if available basis and training 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
the company uses the residual method to recognize revenues when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element 
vsoe of fair value is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately or  for items not yet being sold  it is the price established by management that will not change before the introduction of the item into the marketplace 
under the residual method  the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element s is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered elements 
table of contents does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we recognize revenues related to the delivered products or services only if the above revenue recognition criteria are met  any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services and payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services 
pay as you go arrangements under pay as you go arrangements  license revenues from original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms are generally recognized in each period based on estimated consumption by the oems and odms of products containing the company s software  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we normally recognize revenues for all consumption prior to the end of the accounting period 
since we generally receive quarterly reports from oems and odms approximately to days following the end of a quarter  we have put processes in place to reasonably estimate revenues  by obtaining estimates of production from oem and odm customers and by utilizing historical experience and other relevant current information 
to date the variances between estimated and actual revenues have been immaterial 
volume purchase arrangements vpa beginning with the three month period ended march   with respect to volume purchase agreements vpas with oems and odms  we recognize license revenues for units consumed through the last day of the current accounting period  to the extent the customer has been invoiced for such consumption prior to the end of the current period and provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if the customer agreement provides that the right to consume units lapses at the end of the term of the vpa  we recognize revenues ratably over the term of the vpa if such ratable amount is higher than actual consumption as of the end of the current accounting period 
amounts that have been invoiced under vpas and relate to consumption beyond the current accounting period are recorded as deferred revenues 
subscription fees subscription fees are revenues arising from agreements that provide for the ongoing delivery over a period of time of services  generally delivered over the internet 
primary subscription fee sources include fees charged for security  maintenance  recovery and device management services 
revenue derived from sale of the company s on line subscription services are generally deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period  which typically ranges from one to three years 
services arrangements revenues for non recurring engineering services are generally on a time and materials basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
training and other service fees are recognized as services are performed 
amounts billed in advance for services that are in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues 
goodwill and other long lived intangible assets 
purchased intangible assets include purchased technologies  customer relationships  goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
at september  and  these assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million  respectively 
all the intangible assets were derived from our acquisitions 
the cost of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
the useful life of the intangible assets is estimated based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly and indirectly to the future cash flows 

table of contents the allocation of the acquisition costs to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of management judgment 
the primary method used to determine the fair value of assets acquired is the income approach under which we must make assumptions as to the future cash flows of the acquired entity or assets  the appropriate discount rate to use to present value the cash flows and the anticipated life of the acquired assets 
the company determined the recorded values of intangible assets and goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist at the respective acquisition dates 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of our reporting units to which goodwill relates based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units  as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units  such as cash  are not held by those reporting units but by the corporate departments 
prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units  we are required to assess long lived assets for impairment 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of any goodwill impairment determined 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these reporting units  including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
we perform tests for impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that such assets may be impaired 
this analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or assets are less than the carrying value of the asset or assets we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
we typically estimate the fair value of such assets using an income based approach 
based on various factors  as discussed in more detail in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim impairment analysis in respect of goodwill and other intangible assets as of february  as a result  during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million and million in respect of goodwill and other long lived intangible assets  respectively 
no further goodwill impairment charges were required as a result of the annual impairment test performed at september  further  there was no such goodwill impairment charge recorded during fiscal years and we recognized impairment charges of and million in fiscal years and  respectively  for intangible assets other than goodwill 
performing impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment and the use of significant estimates related to valuation such as discount rates  long term growth rates and the level and timing of future cash flows 
as a result  several factors could result in further impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets balance in future periods  including  but not limited to i a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization such as the decline which occurred subsequent to september  if we determine that the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying values  and 
table of contents ii further weakening of the global economy  continued weakness in the pc industry  or failure of the company to reach its internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result from these factors or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
we will continue to review our goodwill and other long lived assets for possible impairment 
we cannot be certain that a future downturn in our business  changes in market conditions or a longer term decline in the quoted market price of our stock will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets and the recognition of resulting expenses in future periods  which could adversely affect our results of operations for those periods 
allowances for accounts receivable 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
at september  and  the allowance was approximately  and  respectively 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the probable collection from specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  historical revenue variances  analysis of credit memo data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
if economic or specific industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  or if there is a deterioration of our major customers credit worthiness  or actual defaults are higher than our estimates based on historical experience  we would increase the allowance which would impact our results of operations 
income taxes 
estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes assets and valuation allowance when preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure  and assess temporary differences due to different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes  thereby resulting in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform an assessment of the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our ability to achieve taxable income in specific geographies 
as of september   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of million  state net operating loss carry forwards of million  research and development credits of million  foreign tax credits carry forwards of million and state research and development tax credits of million available to offset future taxable income 
our carry forwards will expire over the periods through if not utilized 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
after examining the available evidence at september   we believe a full valuation allowance was appropriate for the us federal and state and certain foreign net deferred tax assets 
in performing the computation of valuation allowance  we performed an assessment of both negative and positive evidence and consider factors such as operating results during recent periods that is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our past financial performance presented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the us federal and state deferred tax assets 
on october   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  related to uncertain income tax positions 
asc provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for tax positions taken by companies and prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
in accordance with asc  we determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not likelihood of greater than of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we use a probability weighted approach and recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than likely of being sustained in the financial statements 
for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we do not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares which contain a service condition 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as 
table of contents well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the company has divided option recipients into three groups outside directors  officers and non officer employees and determined the expected term and anticipated forfeiture rate for each group based on the historical activity of that group 
the expected term is then used in determining the applicable volatility and risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and or cancellations 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the expected life of the options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those options that are expected to vest 
we use monte carlo simulation option pricing model to value stock option grants that contain a market condition such as the options that were granted to the company s four most senior executives and approved by the company s stockholders on january  the monte carlo simulation option pricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the black scholes model  however  it also further incorporates into the fair value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 
the inputs used in valuation models are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
if factors change and as a result we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the stock based compensation expense we record for such future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our future financial results 
retirement benefits 
we provide defined benefit plans in certain countries outside the united states 
the defined benefit plan for our employees in taiwan forms the vast majority of our payments and liability 
the amount recognized in the financial statements in respect of the company s contribution to the employees defined benefit plan is determined based on an actuarial basis 
this determination involves the selection of various assumptions  including an expected rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases and a discount rate 
at september  and  we accrued million and million  respectively  for all such liabilities 
we used the following assumptions in accounting for the taiwan defined benefit pension plan a rate of compensation increases of  a discount rate of and and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the assumptions in respect of discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets are based on a combination of expected market yield  long term interest rates and certain other factors outside the control of the company and therefore  reflect the current best estimates of management 
changes in the above assumptions can impact our actuarially determined obligation and related expense 
see note retirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we record restructuring charges related to excess facilities and severance costs at fair value only when the liability is considered to be incurred as per the applicable accounting pronouncements 
severance costs associated with our standard restructuring plans are recorded once the plan is approved by management and the related severance benefits are communicated to the employees 
excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of the future lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 

table of contents fair value accounting 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date 
our assets subject to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are required to be categorized as level  or the fair value of our level financial assets  which represents our investments in money market funds  is based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security in active markets 
determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
as of september   we did not have any level or level financial assets and liabilities 
see note fair values in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we consider investments purchased with an original remaining maturity of less than three months at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
all investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents at september  and our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment in money market funds 
we do not use leverage or derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during fiscal year  to reduce administrative costs and liquidity risks  we implemented a change in our practices regarding the investment of our cash which led to the elimination of our holdings of marketable securities and an increase in money market fund investments which are considered cash equivalents 
in connection with this change  we sold all of our marketable securities and invested the proceeds in money market funds 
our investment policy permits us to invest in securities with risks greater than those of money market funds and we may do so in the future 
a characteristic of money market funds is that their unit values are not generally sensitive to changes in interest rates 
therefore  investors in these funds are generally not subject to the risk of capital loss from sudden changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk international sales are primarily sourced in their respective countries and are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  our international subsidiaries  other than those located in israel and hungary  incur a significant portion of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  these foreign subsidiaries use their respective local currencies as the functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international operation  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
currencies in which we have significant intercompany balances are the taiwan dollar  indian rupee  hong kong dollar  japanese yen and the euro 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact from a hypothetical and reasonably possible near term change of percent appreciation depreciation of the us dollar from september  market rates would be immaterial to our net loss
