item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality  regarding seasonality of the company s human tissue preservation services and products 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding segment and geographic information 
procurement  distribution  and marketing tissue preservation services cryolife markets its preservation services to tissue procurement agencies  implanting physicians  and prospective tissue recipients 
the company works with tissue banks and organ procurement organizations to ensure consistent and continued availability of donated human tissue for transplant and educates physicians and prospective tissue recipients with respect to the benefits of preserved human tissues 
procurement of tissue 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by tissue banks and organ procurement organizations 
after procurement  the tissue is packed and shipped  together with certain information about the tissue and its donor  to the company in accordance with the company s protocols 
the tissue is transported to the company s laboratory facilities via commercial airlines pursuant to arrangements with qualified courier services 
timely receipt of procured tissue is important  as tissue that is not received promptly cannot be cryopreserved successfully 
the procurement agency is reimbursed by the company for costs associated with these procurement services 
the procurement fee and related shipping costs  together with the charges for the preservation and processing services of the company  are ultimately paid to the company by the hospital or healthcare facility with which the implanting physician is associated 
since the company has received tissue from over  donors 
the company has developed relationships with approximately tissue banks and organ procurement organizations throughout the us management believes these relationships are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides the company with a significant advantage over potential new entrants to this market 
the company employs approximately individuals in donor services and donor quality assurance to work with tissue banks and organ procurement organizations 
this includes four account managers who are stationed throughout the country to work directly with the tissue banks and organ procurement organizations 
the company s central office for procurement relations is staffed hours per day  days per year 
preservation of tissue 
upon receiving tissue  a company technician completes the documentation control for the tissue prepared by the procurement agency and gives it a control number 
the documentation identifies  among other things  donor age and cause of death 
a trained technician then removes the portion or portions of the delivered tissue that will be processed 
the company s cardiac and vascular tissues are preserved in a proprietary freezing process conducted according to company protocols 
after the preservation process  the tissues are transferred to liquid nitrogen freezers for long term storage at temperatures at or below c 
the entire preservation process is controlled by guidelines established by the company and are conducted under aseptic conditions in clean rooms 
at the same time the tissue is processed  samples are taken from the donated tissue and subjected to the company s quality assurance program 
this program  which includes review of the donor and tissue charts by cryolife s tissue quality assurance department and its medical directors  may identify characteristics which would disqualify the tissue for preservation or implantation 
once the tissue is approved  it is moved from quarantine to an implantable status 
tissue that does not pass testing is discarded as appropriate or used for research or other purposes if the donor s family has consented 
distribution of tissue to implanting physicians 
after the tissue has cleared quality control assurance and the tissue is moved to an implantable status  the tissue is stored by the company or is delivered directly to hospitals at the implanting physician s request 
cryopreserved tissue must be transported under stringent handling conditions and maintained within specific temperature tolerances at all times 
cryopreserved tissue is packaged for shipment using the company s proprietary processes 
at the hospital the tissue is implanted immediately or is held in a liquid nitrogen freezer according to company protocols pending implantation 
the company provides a detailed protocol for thawing the cryopreserved tissue 
the company also makes its field personnel available by phone or in person to answer questions 
after the company transports the tissue to the hospital  the company invoices the institution for its services  which include procurement  processing  and transportation 
the company provides company owned liquid nitrogen freezers to certain client hospitals 
the company has currently installed approximately of these freezers 
participating hospitals generally pay the cost of liquid nitrogen and regular maintenance 
the availability of on site freezers makes it easier for a hospital s physicians to utilize the company s preservation services by making the cryopreserved tissue more readily available 
because fees for the company s preservation services become due upon the shipment of tissue to the hospital  the use of such on site freezers also reduces the company s working capital needs 
marketing  educational  and technical support 
the company has records of over  cardiac and vascular surgeons who have implanted tissues preserved by the company during the company works to maintain relationships with and market to surgeons within these medical specialties 
because the company markets its preservation services directly to physicians  an important aspect of increasing the distribution of the company s preservation services is educating physicians on the use of preserved human tissue and on proper implantation techniques 
the company s trained medical relations and education staff and field support personnel provide support to implanting institutions and surgeons 
the company is targeting approximately persons as field service representatives who focus primarily on vascular surgeons  cardiac specialists who focus primarily on cardiac surgeons  and five region managers 
a small number of these positions are open  and the company is actively recruiting for these positions 
the company sponsors physician training seminars where physicians teach other physicians the proper technique for handling and implanting preserved human tissue 
the company also produces educational videos for physicians and coordinates peer to peer training at various medical institutions 
in addition  the company coordinates laboratory sessions to demonstrate surgical techniques 
management believes that these activities improve the medical community s acceptance of the preserved human tissue processed by the company and help to differentiate the company from other allograft processors 
on october and  cryolife hosted the ross summit at cryolife corporate headquarters with cardiac surgeons from nine countries in attendance 
the primary goal of the meeting was to facilitate and encourage the use of the ross procedure 
the ross procedure is an operation in which a patient s defective aortic valve is removed and replaced with his own pulmonary valve and then a human pulmonary valve from a donor is surgically implanted to replace the removed native pulmonary valve 
to assist tissue banks and organ procurement organizations  the company provides educational materials and training on procurement  dissection  packaging  and shipping techniques 
the company also produces educational videos and coordinates laboratory sessions on procurement techniques for procurement agency personnel 
to supplement its educational activities  the company employs in house technical specialists that provide technical information and assistance and maintains a staff hours per day  days per year for customer support 
bioglue in the us the company markets bioglue to physicians and distributes it through its field service representatives and cardiac specialists 
the company markets and distributes bioglue in international markets through direct field representatives employed by the company s wholly owned european subsidiary  cryolife europa  ltd 
europa  and other independent distributors 
through its field representatives  the company conducts field training for implanting surgeons with respect to the application of bioglue 
during the company signed an exclusive agreement with century medical  inc century medical for the introduction and distribution of bioglue in japan 
under the terms of the agreement  century medical is responsible for applications and clearances with the japanese ministry of health and welfare for the use of bioglue in japan 
century medical has submitted the application to the japanese ministry of health and welfare and the review process is ongoing 
hemostase in the us the company markets and distributes hemostase in cardiac and vascular surgery through its field representatives and cardiac specialists 
the company markets and distributes hemostase for cardiac  vascular  and general surgery in international markets except china and japan through direct field representatives employed by europa and other independent distributors 
european operations the company markets its products in the emea region through its european subsidiary  europa based in guildford  england 
europa  with its team of approximately employees  provides customer service  logistics  marketing  and clinical support to cardiac  vascular  thoracic  and general surgeons throughout the emea region 
europa markets and distributes the company s complete range of products through its direct sales representatives in great britain and germany and a network of independent distributors in the emea region 
europa also distributes tissue to certain hospitals in the emea region 
backlog the limited supply of tissue that is donated and available for processing can result in a backlog of orders in the company s human tissue business  primarily for those tissues used in pediatric surgeries 
the amount of backlog fluctuates based on the tissues available for shipment and varies based on the surgical needs of specific cases 
the company s backlog is generally not considered firm and must be confirmed with the customer before shipment 
the company currently does not have a backlog of orders related to bioglue or hemostase 
competition preserved human tissues and bioprosthetic cardiac and vascular devices the company currently faces competition from at least two non profit tissue banks that cryopreserve and distribute human cardiac and vascular tissue  as well as from several companies that market mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  and synthetic vascular grafts for implantation 
many established companies  some with resources greater than those of the company  are engaged in manufacturing  marketing  and selling alternatives to preserved human tissue 
management believes that it competes with other entities that cryopreserve human tissue on the basis of technology  customer service  and quality assurance 
management believes that the human heart valves preserved by the company  as compared to mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  compete on the factors set forth above  as well as by providing a tissue that is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions  such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction  valve replacements for women in their child bearing years  and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis 
the company believes the cryovalve sg enables the company to compete with other valves by providing a valve processed with a technology designed to remove donor cells and cellular remnants from the valve without compromising the integrity of the underlying collagen matrix 
the company believes that the cryovalve sg is important to patient management issues of whole organ transplant recipients  as discussed in recent events 
generally  for each procedure that may utilize vascular human tissue that the company preserves  there are alternative treatments 
often  in the case of veins  these alternatives include the repair  partial removal  or complete removal of the damaged tissue and may utilize other tissues from the patients themselves or synthetic products 
the attending physician  in consultation with the patient  makes the selection of treatment choices 
any newly developed treatments may also compete with the use of tissue preserved by the company 
human heart valves 
alternatives to human heart valves preserved by the company include mechanical valves  porcine valves  and valves constructed from bovine pericardium 
st 
jude medical  inc is the leading supplier of mechanical heart valves 
medtronic  inc is the leading supplier of porcine heart valves 
edwards life sciences  inc is the leading supplier of bovine pericardial heart valves 
the company is aware of at least six companies that offer porcine  bovine  and mechanical heart valves 
in addition  management believes that at least two domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for human heart valves in competition with the company 
human vascular tissue 
there are a number of providers of synthetic alternatives to veins preserved by the company and those alternatives are available primarily in medium and large diameters 
two primary synthetic grafts that compete with the company s vascular tissue for below the knee surgery are wl gore associates propaten and wl bard  inc s distaflo 
maquet  inc 
s hemashield woven grafts can be used for the aortoiliac aneurysm surgery 
currently  management believes that there are at least two other non profit tissue banks that preserve and distribute human vascular tissue in competition with the company 
companies offering either synthetic or allograft products may enter this market in the future 
bioglue the company competes with many domestic and international medical device and pharmaceutical companies 
in the surgical adhesive and surgical sealant area  the company competes primarily with baxter international  inc s tisseel and coseal  ethicon  inc 
s a johnson johnson company evicel  covidien ltd s us surgical division s duraseal product  and tenaxis  inc s tenaxis arterx 
the company currently competes with these products based on the products benefits and features  such as strength and ease of use 
competitive products may also be under development by other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources than the company 
these competitors may also have greater experience in developing products  conducting clinical trials  and obtaining regulatory approvals 
certain of these competitors may obtain patent protection  approval  or clearance by the fda or foreign countries  or product commercialization earlier than the company 
the company may also compete with companies that have superior manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities 
any of these competitive disadvantages could materially adversely affect the company 
hemostase the company s hemostase product competes with thrombin products  including king pharmaceuticals  inc s thrombin jmi  zymogenetics  inc s recothrom  and omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc 
s a johnson johnson company evithrom  and surgical hemostats  including pfizer  inc s gelfoam  cr bard  inc 
s avitene  baxter international  inc 
s floseal  and ethicon  inc s surgicel  surgiflo  and surgifoam products 
in addition  starch medical inc has a hemostatic product that has ce approval and that will compete in the future outside of the us a number of companies have surgical hemostat products under development 
other medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies may also develop competitive products 
the company s hemostase product competes on the basis of its safety profile  its clinical efficacy  and ease of use 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources than the company 
these competitors may also have greater experience in developing products  conducting clinical trials  and obtaining regulatory approvals 
certain of these competitors may obtain patent protection  approval  or clearance by the fda or foreign countries  or product commercialization earlier than the company 
the company may also compete with companies that have superior manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities 
any of these competitive disadvantages could materially adversely affect the company 
general other recently developed technologies or procedures are  or may in the future be  the basis of competitive products 
there can be no assurance that the company s current competitors or other parties will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use  or more economical than those which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and non competitive in these fields 
in such event  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see part i  item a  risk factors risks relating to our business rapid technological change could cause our services and products to become obsolete 
research and development and clinical research the company uses its expertise in protein chemistry  biochemistry  and cell biology  and its understanding of the needs of the cardiac and vascular surgery medical specialties to attempt to expand its surgical adhesive and preservation businesses and to develop or acquire products and technologies for these specialties 
the company identifies market areas that can benefit from preserved living tissues  medical devices  and other related technologies  and then attempts to develop innovative techniques  services and products within these areas  to secure their commercial protection  to establish their clinical efficacy  and then to market these techniques  services and products 
the company employs approximately people in its research and development and clinical research departments  including six phds with specialties in the fields of molecular biology  protein chemistry  vascular physiology  biochemistry  bioengineering  biostatistics  and zoology 
in order to expand the company s service and product offerings  the company is currently in the process of developing or investigating several technologies and products  including technologies related to human tissue preservation  its pht product platform used in bioglue  biofoam  biodisc  and other pht derivatives  additional applications of its synergraft technology  and organ transplant solutions 
at the fda s request  the company has committed to conducting a post clearance study to collect long term clinical data for the cryovalve sg 
the company submitted a proposed study to the fda in december data collected in this study will be compared to data from a defined control group implanted with a standard processed pulmonary human heart valve 
the company believes the information obtained from this study may help ascertain whether the synergraft process extends the long term durability of the valve 
additionally  explant analyses may help determine if the collagen matrix recellularizes with the recipient s own cells 
in october the company signed a licensing and distribution agreement with bioform for the development and commercialization of bioglue for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications under the name bioglue aesthetic 
the agreement calls for bioform to fund the clinical development and regulatory approval process for commercializing bioglue for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications in the us  canada  and various countries in europe 
in addition  bioform will oversee all aspects of the marketing  sales  and distribution of bioglue in the us  canada  and various countries in europe for these indications 
the company will remain the exclusive supplier of bioglue for all applications 
under the terms of the agreement  the company received an initial fee from bioform and will receive a milestone payment upon the first fda approval for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications 
bioform has completed a feasibility study under an investigational device exemption  or ide  from the fda and is currently under discussions with the fda regarding the requirements of the pivotal study  the initial study necessary before submission of an ide 
bioform s strategy is to determine compelling aesthetic applications for bioglue  demonstrate safety and effectiveness of this material in aesthetic applications  and launch bioglue as an alternative fixation methodology to improve browplasty and certain other surgical and minimally invasive aesthetic procedures 
bioform received a ce mark in june for the use of bioglue for fixation following endoscopic browplasty  commonly called brow lift  a reconstructive plastic surgery procedure 
bioform plans to introduce this product in europe in early biofoam  a product in the pht platform  contains a foaming agent  which has the potential to rapidly seal organs  such as the liver and spleen  and may provide hemostasis in penetrating wounds and trauma 
under the   and  us congress defense appropriations conference reports the company was awarded  million  and  respectively  for the continued development of protein hydrogel technology for use on the battlefield 
the us congress defense appropriations conference report included million for the continued development of protein hydrogel technology 
the company anticipates applying for additional funding under this bill in the company is currently involved in initial animal trials related to this grant 
in december the company received conditional approval for biofoam from the fda for the feasibility phase of the company s ide submission for abdominal organ sealing 
before the company can begin the feasibility study  the company must receive an additional approval from the us department of defense as a condition of its award 
the company is in the final review process with the department of defense 
in addition  in december the company filed a ce mark submission with its notified body for biofoam as an adjunct to conventional methods to control organ bleeding when bleeding control by conventional methods is ineffective or impractical 
the company continues to conduct preclinical research with biofoam for use in wound sealing in trauma surgery 
biodisc  a product in the pht platform  is undergoing clinical evaluation to determine its utility as a nucleus pulposus replacement in spinal disc repair 
the nucleus pulposus is surrounded by fibrous tissue annulus fibrosis and is located in the center of the vertebral disc 
the nucleus pulposus is composed of a gelatinous like material that in conjunction with the annulus fibrosis acts as a cushion or shock absorber to the spinal column 
if the nucleus pulposus herniates through the annulus  it may be removed in a procedure known as a discectomy 
biodisc is designed to fill the area where the nucleus pulposus was removed and is intended to preserve disc height  reduce lumbar motion segment instability  and reduce recurrent disc herniation 
a ten patient study enrollment and a two year follow up have been completed 
the company filed a ce mark submission in february and received a response from its notified body in the fourth quarter of the company is currently formulating its response to questions raised by its notified body on its ce mark submission 
management believes that the notified body may require additional human implants and clinical follow up prior to granting a ce mark 
if additional human implants are required  the company will likely seek a partner to assist in the development prior to investing additional material funds in biodisc 
to the extent the company identifies additional applications for its products  the company may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development of such applications or seek funding from outside sources to continue the commercial development of such technologies 
the company may also attempt to license additional technologies from third parties to supplement its product lines 
the company s research and development strategy is to allocate available resources among the company s core market areas of preservation services and medical devices  based on the size of the potential market for any specific product candidate  the estimated development time and cost required to bring the product to market  and the expected efficacy of the potential product 
research on these and other projects is conducted in the company s research and development laboratory or at universities or clinics where the company sponsors research projects 
the company s medical and scientific advisory board consults on various research and development programs 
the company s preclinical studies are conducted at universities and other locations outside the company s facilities by third parties under contract with the company 
in addition to these efforts the company may pursue other research and development activities 
in   and the company spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on research and development activities on new and existing products 
these amounts represented approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years   and  respectively 
processing  manufacturing  and operations the company s corporate headquarters and laboratory facilities consist of approximately  square feet of leased manufacturing  administrative  laboratory  and warehouse space located on a acre setting in suburban atlanta  georgia  with an additional  square feet of off site warehouse space 
approximately  square feet are dedicated as class  clean rooms

the elkins learning center provides visiting surgeons with a hands on training environment for surgical and implantation techniques for the company s technology platforms 
tissue processing the tissue processing laboratory is responsible for the processing and preservation of human cardiac and vascular tissue for transplant 
this laboratory contains approximately  square feet with a suite of seven clean rooms dedicated to processing 
currently  there are approximately technicians employed in this area  and the laboratory is staffed hours per day  days per year 
in the laboratory packaged approximately  human tissues 
the current processing level is estimated to be at about of total capacity 
to produce at full capacity levels  the company would have to increase the amount of donated tissues  which the company could attempt to do by increasing the number of relationships with tissue banks and organ procurement organizations  or working to increase donor awareness to increase tissue donation 
the attempt to increase the amount of tissues processed could be constrained by the availability of donated tissues 
if additional donated tissues were obtained  the company would need to increase the number of employees and add equipment 
bioglue bioglue is presently manufactured at the company s headquarters facility 
the laboratory contains approximately  square feet  including a suite of six clean rooms 
currently  there are approximately technicians employed in this area 
the laboratory has a potential annual capacity of approximately million cartridges or syringes of bioglue 
the current processing level is about of total capacity 
to produce at full capacity levels  the company would need to increase the number of employees  add work shifts  and install automated filling and pouching equipment 
other medical devices the bioprosthesis laboratory at the company s headquarters facility is responsible for the expected manufacturing of the propatch surgical mesh 
this laboratory is approximately  square feet with a suite of six clean rooms for tissue processing 
europa the company maintains a leased facility located in guildford  england for its european subsidiary  europa  which contains approximately  square feet of office space 
quality assurance the company s operations encompass the processing of human tissue and the manufacturing of medical devices 
in all of its facilities the company is subject to regulatory standards for good manufacturing practices  including current good tissue practices or cgtps  which are the fda regulatory requirements for processing of human tissue  and current quality system regulations  which are the fda regulatory requirements for medical device manufacturers 
the fda periodically inspects company facilities to review company compliance with these and other regulations 
the company also operates according to international organization for standardization or iso quality system requirements  an internationally recognized voluntary system of quality management for companies that design  develop  manufacture  distribute  and service medical devices 
the company maintains a certification of approval to the iso lloyd s register quality assurance limited lrqa issues this approval 
lrqa is a notified body officially recognized by the eu to perform assessments of compliance with iso and the medical device directive 
the medical device directive is the governing document for the eu that details requirements for safety and risk 
lrqa performs periodic on site inspections  generally at least annually  of the company s quality systems 
the company s quality assurance staff is comprised primarily of experienced professionals from the medical device manufacturing industry 
the quality assurance department  in conjunction with the company s research and development department  routinely evaluates the company s processes and procedures 
tissue preservation services the company employs a comprehensive quality assurance program in all of its tissue processing activities 
the company is subject to human cells and tissue regulations  including donor eligibility and good tissue practice regulations  as well as other fda quality system regulations  and iso requirements 
the company s quality assurance program begins with the development and implementation of training policies and procedures for the employees of procurement agencies 
to assure uniformity of procurement practices among the tissue recovery teams  the company provides procurement protocols  transport packages  and tissue transport liquids to the procurement organizations 
the company periodically audits procurement organizations to ensure and enhance recovery practices 
upon receipt by the company  each incoming tissue is assigned a unique control number that provides traceability of tissue from procurement through the processing and preservation processes and  ultimately  to the tissue recipient 
samples from each tissue donor are subjected to a variety of tests to screen and test for infectious diseases 
samples of some tissues are also provided for pathology testing 
following dissection of the tissue to be preserved  dissected tissue is treated with a proprietary antimicrobial solution and aseptically packaged 
after antimicrobial treatment  each tissue must be shown to be free of detectable microbial contaminants before being considered releasable for distribution 
the materials and solutions used by the company in processing tissue must meet the company s quality standards and be approved by quality assurance personnel for use in processing 
throughout tissue processing  detailed records of the tissues  materials  and processes used are maintained and reviewed by quality assurance personnel 
the fda periodically audits the company s processing facilities for compliance with its requirements 
the states of california  delaware  florida  georgia  illinois  maryland  new york  and oregon license or register the company s tissue processing facilities as facilities that process  store  and distribute human tissue for implantation 
the regulatory bodies of these states may perform inspections of the facilities as required to ensure compliance with state laws and regulations 
medical device manufacturing the company employs a comprehensive quality assurance program in all of its manufacturing activities 
the company is subject to quality system regulations and iso and medical device directive requirements 
all materials and components utilized in the production of the company s products are received and inspected by trained quality control personnel according to written specifications and standard operating procedures 
only materials and components found to comply with company standards are accepted by quality control and utilized in production 
all materials  components  and resulting sub assemblies are documented throughout the manufacturing process to assure traceability 
all processes in manufacturing are validated by quality engineers to produce products meeting the company s specifications 
the company maintains a quality assurance program to evaluate and inspect manufactured products to ensure conformity to product specifications 
each process is documented along with all inspection results  including final finished product inspection and acceptance 
records are maintained as to the consignees of products to track product performance and to facilitate product removals or corrections  if necessary 
the company s manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and lrqa to independently review the company s compliance with its systems and regulatory requirements 
patents  licenses  and other proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  confidentiality agreements  and security procedures to protect its proprietary products  processing technology  trade secrets  and know how 
the company believes that its patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and technology licensing rights provide it with important competitive advantages 
the company owns or has licensed rights to us patents and foreign patents  including patents relating to its technology for human cardiac and vascular tissue preservation  tissue revitalization prior to freezing  tissue transport  tissue packing  bioglue manufacturing  and pht manufacturing 
the company has approximately pending us patent applications and pending foreign applications that relate to the company s cryopreservation  pht  and other areas 
there can be no assurance that any patents pending will result in issued patents 
the remaining duration of the company s issued patents ranges from to years 
the main patent for bioglue expires in in the us and in in the rest of the world 
in addition  the company has distribution agreements with third parties for the distribution of hemostase 
this product has patents license rights and trade secrets that provide competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in any of the company s existing or future patents will provide competitive advantages for the company s products  processes  and technologies or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
there can also be no assurances that the claims allowed in patents licensed or owned by third parties for products distributed by the company will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
to the extent that any of the company s products  whether manufactured by the company or distributed by it  are not effectively patent protected  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
under current law  patent applications in the us and patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
the right to a patent in the us is attributable to the first to invent  not the first to file a patent application 
the company cannot be sure that products manufactured or distributed by it  or the technologies developed by it  do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that they do not infringe any patents currently existing or proprietary rights of third parties 
for example  we have filed suit in germany against tenaxis because we believe tenaxis is infringing our main bioglue patent in germany 
this company has filed a separate nullity suit against this same bioglue patent in germany 
should we be unsuccessful in our lawsuit regarding infringement of our bioglue patent in germany or should this nullity lawsuit filed by tenaxis be successful  our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
the company may incur substantial legal fees in defending against a patent infringement claim or in asserting claims against third parties 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from marketing certain of its products  could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of such patents  or could be required to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
the company s failure to obtain licenses or to redesign its products or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company has agreements with third parties for certain technologies related to its bioglue and synergraft technologies that call for the payment of royalties based on the revenues of such products 
the company has entered into confidentiality agreements with its employees  several of its consultants  and third party vendors to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the obligations of employees of the company and third parties with whom the company has entered into confidentiality agreements will effectively prevent disclosure of the company s confidential information or provide meaningful protection for the company s confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by the company s competitors 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce patents and trademarks of the company  or to protect trade secrets and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such litigation 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us suppliers  sources  and availability of tissues and raw materials our tissue processing and preservation services and our ability to supply needed tissues is dependent upon donation of tissues from human donors 
we must rely on the tissue banks and organ procurement organizations that we work with to educate the public on the need for donation and to foster a willingness to donate tissue 
we must also maintain good relationships with our tissue procurement organizations and tissue banks to ensure that we will receive donated tissue 
in addition  regulations could reduce the availability of tissue available for implantation 
our bioglue product is comprised of bovine protein and a cross linker that is delivered to the site through a delivery device 
the delivery devices are manufactured by a single supplier 
although we maintain an inventory of devices  if the single supplier was to cease producing devices for us for other than a short period of time  it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture bioglue and would materially adversely affect our revenues 
hemostase is produced by medafor for us pursuant to our distribution agreement 
if medafor was unable to obtain the appropriate raw materials for hemostase in order to manufacture it for the company  it would materially adversely affect our ability to sell hemostase and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
government regulation us federal regulation of medical devices the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdca provides that  unless exempted by regulation  medical devices may not be distributed in the us unless they have been approved or cleared for marketing by the fda 
there are two review procedures by which medical devices can receive such approval or clearance 
some products may qualify for clearance to be marketed under a section k procedure  in which the manufacturer provides a premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing the product  and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed k product ie  that it has the same intended use  it is as safe and effective as a legally marketed k device  and it does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device 
in some cases the submission must include data from clinical studies 
marketing may commence when the fda issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence 
if the product does not qualify for the k procedure either because it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed k device or because it is a class iii device required by the fdca and implementing regulations to have an approved application for premarket approval pma  the fda must approve a pma application before marketing can begin 
pma applications must demonstrate  among other matters  that the medical device is safe and effective 
a pma application is typically a complex submission  usually including the results of human clinical studies  and preparing an application is a detailed and time consuming process 
once a pma application has been submitted  the fda s review may be lengthy and may include requests for additional data 
the fdca also provides for an investigational device exemption ide which authorizes distribution for clinical evaluation of devices that lack a pma or k clearance 
devices subject to an ide are subject to various restrictions imposed by the fda 
the number of patients that may be treated with the device is limited  as is the number of institutions at which the device may be used 
patients must give informed consent to be treated with an investigational device  and review by an institutional review board is needed 
the device must be labeled that it is for investigational use and may not be advertised or otherwise promoted and the price charged for the device may be limited 
unexpected adverse events must be reported to the fda 
under certain circumstances  the fda may grant a humanitarian device exemption hde 
the fda grants hde s in an attempt to encourage the development of medical devices for use in the treatment of rare conditions that affect small patient populations 
such approval by the fda exempts the device from full compliance with clinical study requirements for a pma 
the fdca requires all medical device manufacturers and distributors to register with the fda annually and to provide the fda with a list of those medical devices that they distribute commercially 
the fdca also requires manufacturers of medical devices to comply with labeling requirements and to manufacture devices in accordance with quality system regulations  which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain their documents in a prescribed manner with respect to good manufacturing practices  design  document production  process  labeling and packaging controls  process validation  and other quality control activities 
the fda s medical device reporting regulation requires that a device manufacturer provide information to the fda on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its products  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the fda further requires that certain medical devices that may not be sold in the us follow certain procedures before they are exported 
the fda inspects medical device manufacturers and distributors and has authority to seize noncomplying medical devices  enjoin and or impose civil penalties on manufacturers and distributors marketing non complying medical devices  criminally prosecute violators  and order recalls in certain instances 
human heart valves 
the company s human heart valves became subject to regulation by the fda in june  when the fda published a notice stating that human heart valves were class iii medical devices under the fdca 
the june notice provided that distribution of human heart valves for transplantation would violate the fdca unless they were the subject of an approved pma or ide on or before august  on october   however  the fda announced in the federal register that neither an approved application for pma nor an ide is required for processors and distributors who had marketed heart valve allografts before june  this action by the fda resulted in the company s allograft heart valves being classified as class ii medical devices and removed them from clinical trial status 
it also allowed the company to distribute such valves to cardiac surgeons throughout the us on may   with the promulgation of the final rule for cgtps  the fda reclassified human heart valves  processed on or after may   as human tissue which is subject to that rule 
however  human tissues must meet certain criteria to be solely regulated as human tissue 
these criteria include being processed in a manner that is considered not to involve more than minimal manipulation of the tissue and being promoted for a clinical use that is consistent with the same basic function that the tissue served in the donor 
synergraft processing of cardiovascular tissue was evaluated by the fda to be more than minimal manipulation  therefore  the cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve falls under the medical device regulations 
on february  the company received k clearance from the fda for its cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve processed with the company s proprietary synergraft technology  as discussed in recent events 
porcine heart valves 
porcine heart valves are class iii medical devices and fda approval of a pma is required prior to commercial distribution of such valves in the us the porcine heart valves currently marketed by the company have not been approved by the fda for commercial distribution in the us  but may be manufactured in the us and exported to foreign countries if the valves meet the specifications of the foreign purchaser and do not conflict with the laws of  and are approved by  the country to which they will be exported 
bioglue 
the fda regulates bioglue as a class iii medical device 
in december the company received an ide pma approval from the fda for bioglue as an adjunct to sutures and staples for use in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels 
prior to this approval  the company received an hde in december for bioglue for use as an adjunct in repair of acute thoracic aortic dissections 
the product is health canada  australia  and ce mark approved for additional soft tissue repair 
hemostase 
the fda regulates hemostase as a class iii medical device 
in the manufacturer of hemostase received a pma approval from the fda for use its in surgical procedures except neurological  ophthalmic  and urological as an adjunctive hemostatic device to assist when control of capillary  venous  and arteriolar bleeding by pressure  ligature  and other conventional procedures is ineffective or impractical 
in addition  hemostase has ce mark approval and is health canada approved for similar clinical uses 
us federal regulation of human tissue the fda regulates human tissues pursuant to section of the public health services act phs act  which in turn provides the regulatory framework for regulation of human cellular and tissue products 
concerns with the transmission of hiv and hepatitis b led the fda to issue an interim rule in december as an emergency measure to protect the public from any human tissue that had incomplete or no documentation ascertaining its freedom from communicable diseases 
the fda modified the regulation and reissued it as a new rule cfr part  effective january  which focused on donor screening and testing to prevent the introduction  transmission  and spread of hiv and and hepatitis b and c 
the rule set minimal requirements to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases from human tissue used for transplantation 
the rule defines human tissue as any tissue derived from a human body which is i intended for administration to another human for the diagnosis  cure  mitigation  treatment  or prevention of any condition or disease and ii recovered  processed  stored  or distributed by methods not intended to change tissue function or characteristics 
the fda definition excludes  among other things  tissue that currently is regulated as a human drug  biological product  or medical device and it also excludes kidney  liver  heart  lung  pancreas  or any other vascularized human organ 
the current regulations applicable to human tissues include requirements for donor suitability  processing standards  establishment registration  and product listing 
on january  the fda published regulations that require human cells  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products establishments to register with the agency and list their human cells  tissues  and cellular and tissue based products hct ps 
the final rule  cfr parts  became effective on april  for human tissues intended for transplantation that are regulated under section of the phs act as well as part it became effective for all other hct ps when the remaining parts of cfr part were finalized 
in may the fda published regulations governing the eligibility of donors of human cell and tissue products 
this rule expands previous requirements for testing and screening for risks of communicable diseases that could be spread by the use of these tissues 
in november the fda published regulations governing the procedures and processes related to the manufacture of human cell and tissue products under the cgtps 
both the new donor eligibility rule and the cgtp rule became effective on may  and designate human heart valves processed on or after may  as human tissue rather than medical devices 
it is likely that the fda s regulation of processed human tissue will continue to evolve in the future 
complying with fda regulatory requirements or obtaining required fda approvals or clearances may entail significant time delays and expense or may not be possible  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
for example  on january   the fda issued draft guidance for current good tissue practice and additional requirements for manufactures of hct ps 
this guidance is subject to comment and change before formally issued by the fda 
possible other fda regulation other products and processes under development by the company are likely to be subject to regulation by the fda 
some may be classified as medical devices or human cells and tissue products  while others may be classified as drugs or biological products  or may be subject to a regulatory process that the fda may adopt in the future 
regulation of drugs and biological products is substantially similar to regulation of class iii medical devices 
obtaining fda approval to market these products and processes is likely to be a time consuming and expensive process  and there can be no assurance that any of these products or processes will ever receive fda approval 
nota regulation the company s activities in processing and transporting human hearts and certain other organs are also subject to federal regulation under the national organ transplant act nota  which makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire  receive  or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce 
nota excludes from the definition of valuable consideration reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of a human organ 
the purpose of this statutory provision is to allow for compensation for legitimate services 
the company believes that to the extent its activities are subject to nota  it meets this statutory provision relating to the reasonableness of its charges 
there can be no assurance  however  that restrictive interpretations of nota will not be adopted in the future that would call into question one or more aspects of the company s methods of charging for its preservation services 
state licensing requirements some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the processing  transportation  and storage of human organs and tissues 
the activities the company engages in require it to be licensed as a clinical laboratory or tissue bank under california  delaware  florida  georgia  illinois  maryland  new york  and oregon law 
the company has such licenses  and the company believes it is in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations relating to clinical laboratories and tissue banks that store  process  and distribute human tissue designed to be used for medical purposes in human beings 
there can be no assurance  however  that more restrictive state laws or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect the company s operations 
certain employees of the company have obtained other required state licenses 
international approval requirements sales of medical devices and biological products outside the us are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of other countries must be obtained prior to commercial distribution of the product in those countries 
the time required to obtain these approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the eea recognizes a single medical device approval  called a ce mark  which allows for distribution of an approved product throughout the eea member state countries european union eu countries  and european free trade association efta countries without additional general applications in each country 
however  individual eea members reserve the right to require additional labeling or information to address particular patient safety issues prior to allowing marketing 
third parties called notified bodies award the ce mark 
these notified bodies are approved and subject to review by the competent authorities of their respective countries 
a number of countries outside of the eea accept the ce mark in lieu of marketing submissions as an addendum to that country s application process 
the company has been issued ce marks for bioglue and the cryolife o brien stentless porcine aortic bioprosthesis and has ce approval for the distribution of hemostase 
bioglue may be exported to more than countries outside the us and the hemostase and cryolife o brien aortic bioprosthesis products may be exported to the eea and canada 
in addition  the distribution of cryolife s processed human tissues in certain countries in europe is subject to regulatory approvals or requirements 
cryolife ships tissues into the united kingdom  germany  austria  and israel 
in and through three separate directives the eu passed the european union tissue and cells directives eutcd which established an approach to the regulation of tissues and cells across europe 
the eutcd set a benchmark for the standards that must be met when carrying out any activity involving tissues and cells that would be implanted in humans 
the eutcd also require that systems be put in place to ensure that all tissues and cells used in human application are traceable from donor to recipient 
pursuant to the eutcd  each country in the eea has responsibility for regulating tissues and cells and distribution and procurement of tissues and cells for use in humans through a competent authority 
in the united kingdom  this competent authority is the human tissue authority  which has promulgated various directives that affect cryolife s shipment of tissues into the united kingdom and europa s import of these tissues 
europa is a licensed establishment under hta directions and both europa and cryolife are subject to certain regulatory requirements  including maintenance of records and tracing of shipments from donor to recipient 
in germany this competent authority is the paul erlich institute pei  which enforces various regulations passed by the regulatory authorities in germany 
europa has a provisional license in germany and is awaiting pei s final approval of its license 
austria has not implemented any additional requirements under the eutcd  but could and will likely do so in the future 
other countries in the eea are in the process of implementing the eutcd  and if cryolife chooses to ship tissues into these countries  it will likely need to obtain licenses to do so 
each competent authority could modify its regulations or directions  which could impact our ability to send processed tissues into europe 
environmental matters the company s tissue processing activities generate some biomedical wastes  consisting primarily of human and animal pathological and biological wastes  including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures 
the biomedical wastes generated by the company are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes generated by the company 
the company contracts with third parties for transport  treatment  and disposal of biomedical waste 
although the company believes it is in compliance in the disposal of its waste with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the us environmental protection agency and the georgia department of natural resources  environmental protection division  the failure by the company  or the companies with which it contracts  to comply fully with any such regulations could result in an imposition of penalties  fines  or sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
employees as of december  the company had approximately employees 
these employees included six persons with phd degrees  three with md degrees  and one with a md degree 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage or interruption due to labor disputes 
management believes its relations with its employees are good

item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to our business we are significantly dependent on our revenues from bioglue and are subject to a variety of risks affecting this product 
bioglue is a significant source of our revenues 
should the product be the subject of adverse developments with regard to its safety  efficacy  or reimbursement practices  or if a competitor s product obtains greater acceptance  or our rights to manufacture and market this product are challenged  the result could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
also  we have only two suppliers of bovine serum albumen  which is necessary for the manufacture of bioglue 
furthermore  we presently have only one supplier for our bioglue syringe 
if we lose one or more of these suppliers  our ability to manufacture and sell bioglue could be adversely impacted 
we cannot be sure that we would be able to replace any such loss on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition our us patent for bioglue expires in and our patents in the rest of the world for bioglue expire in following expiration of these patents  competitors may utilize the inventions disclosed in the bioglue patents in competing products  which could materially reduce our revenues and income from bioglue 
see uncertainties related to patents and protection of proprietary technology may adversely affect the value of our intellectual property  below 
we may receive a form notice of observations  a warning letter  or other similar communication from the fda and we may be unable to address the concerns raised by the fda in such correspondence or communication  or addressing the concerns may be costly or could materially and adversely affect our operations 
the fda has issued form notices of observations and warning letters to us in the past that have noted deficiencies in our operations  including process validation  complaint handling and reporting  and analysis of certain testing results  among other items 
although we have had positive fda inspections recently  we could still be subject to an fda inspection that results in a form if the fda deems our responses to a form unsatisfactory  it could take further action  such as issuing us a warning letter  or in the alternative even before issuing a form  the fda could issue a warning letter or other similar communication directly to us 
corrective actions taken by us to address these regulatory actions could materially and adversely affect our revenues  financial position  profitability  or cash flows 
if we are unable to implement adequate corrective actions required by a warning letter or similar request made by the fda  the fda could do the following institute additional recalls of tissues or products  require us to perform additional tests  begin to require prescriptions for tissues or products where they are not currently required  halt the shipping or processing of tissues or products  require additional approvals for marketing our tissue services or products or assess civil penalties 
all of these could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
synergraft processed human pulmonary heart valves and other synergraft products may not be accepted by the marketplace 
cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valves may not perform as well as expected or provide all of the benefits anticipated by the marketplace and  as a result  the company may not be able to continue to process a portion of its human pulmonary valves with its synergraft technology 
if such an event were to occur  the company would need to return to processing most or all of its pulmonary human heart valves without the synergraft technology  which could significantly reduce the expected benefits of the synergraft technology 
in addition other products being developed for commercialization by cryolife that utilize the synergraft process  such as propatch  cryolife s soft tissue repair matrix for use in hernia repair and certain orthopaedic related conditions  may not provide the anticipated benefits or otherwise achieve marketplace acceptance 
synergraft processed human pulmonary heart valves have a one year shelf life 
we are currently using the synergraft technology for a portion of our human pulmonary heart valve processing pursuant to the k clearance we have received for the synergraft treated valves 
our synergraft pulmonary human heart valves currently have a one year shelf life  whereas our non synergraft processed pulmonary human heart valves have a five year shelf life 
we are currently in discussions with the fda to extend the shelf life of our synergraft pulmonary human heart valves 
we do not know when the shelf life of the synergraft pulmonary human heart valves may be extended  if at all 
accordingly  if we do not implant our synergraft pulmonary human heart valves within one year of cryopreservation  we may be required to discard these valves  and as a result we may lose more tissues than before we started processing pulmonary human heart valves with the synergraft technology  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
we are dependent on the availability of sufficient quantities of tissue from human donors 
the success of our tissue preservation services depends upon  among other factors  the availability of sufficient quantities of tissue from human donors 
we rely primarily upon the efforts of third party procurement organizations  tissue banks  most of which are not for profit  and others to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue 
if the supply of donated human tissue is materially reduced  this would restrict our growth and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
our cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve post clearance study may not provide expected results 
at the fda s request  we are conducting a post clearance study to seek evidence for the potential and implied long term benefits of the synergraft process used to process the cryovalve sg 
we expect the data to be collected to include long term safety and hemodynamic function  immune response  and explant analysis 
although we believe that this information may help us ascertain whether the synergraft process reduces the immune response of the transplanted human heart valve and allows for the collagen matrix to recellularize with the recipient s own cells  it is possible that the results of the study will not be as expected 
if this study shows that the synergraft process does not reduce immune response and or cause the collagen matrix to recellularize with the recipient s cells  we may be unable to realize some or all of the long term benefits that we anticipated for the use of this process 
the fda has previously issued a recall of certain of our products and has the ability to inspect our facilities  suspend our operations  and issue a recall of our products in the future 
on august  we received an order from the fda regarding the non valved cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues processed by the company since october   referred to as the fda order 
pursuant to the fda order  we placed non valve cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue processed since october  on quality assurance quarantine and recalled the portion of those tissues that had been distributed but not implanted 
in addition we ceased processing non valved cardiac and vascular tissues until mid september and ceased processing orthopaedic tissues until the fda order resulted in the destruction of much of our tissue  required that we adjust revenue for tissue recall returns  curtailed our processing activities  and subjected us to intense fda scrutiny and additional regulatory requirements that increased costs 
we also suffered decreased revenues due to lack of processing ability  decreased market demand for our services  and were faced with liability lawsuits 
these challenges reduced our revenues  increased our costs to process tissues and our operating expenses  and strained management resources and available cash 
although we resumed processing and distribution of the types of tissues subject to the fda order and resolved many of the product liability suits pending against us  we incurred losses and did not produce cash from operations for many years 
any future recalls or other regulatory action by the fda could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
the fda can inspect our facilities  review complaints against us  monitor the efficacy of our products and the claims we make regarding our products benefits  and issue reports to us on areas that require improvement 
if the fda believes that we are not responsive to their requests for any suggested improvement or that our products are not in compliance with regulatory norms  the fda has the ability to suspend our operations and issue an order for the recall of any or all of our products 
if the fda issues such an order  our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our products and the tissues we process allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients  and we have been and may be exposed to product liability claims and additional regulatory scrutiny as a result 
the processing  preservation  and distribution of human tissue  bovine tissue products  porcine tissue products  and the manufacture and sale of medical devices entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and have resulted and may result in product liability claims against us and adverse publicity 
from time to time various plaintiffs have asserted that our tissue or medical devices have caused a variety of injuries  including death 
when patients are injured  die  or have other adverse results following procedures using our tissue or medical devices  we have been and may be sued and our insurance coverage has been and may be inadequate 
adverse judgments and settlements in excess of our available insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our financial position  profitability  and cash flows 
as a result of medical complications that are alleged to have been caused by or occur in connection with medical procedures involving our tissue or medical devices  we have been and may be subject to additional fda and other regulatory scrutiny and inspections and adverse publicity 
for example  shortly after the fda order  the fda posted a notice  now archived  on its website stating its concerns regarding our heart valve preservation services 
as a result  some surgeons and hospitals decided not to use our heart valves 
cautionary statements from the fda or other regulators regarding our tissue services or products  adverse publicity  changes to our labeling  or required prominent warnings or negative reviews from the fda or regulators of our processing and manufacturing facilities have decreased and may in the future decrease demand for our tissue services or products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
in addition to the recall resulting from the fda order  we have in the past suspended or recalled  and in the future may have to suspend the distribution of or recall  particular types of tissues as a result of reported adverse events in connection with our tissues 
suspension of the distribution of  or recall of  our tissue services or products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
uncertainties related to patents and protection of proprietary technology may adversely affect the value of our intellectual property 
we own several patents  patent applications  and licenses relating to our technologies  which we believe provide us with important competitive advantages 
in addition  we have certain proprietary technologies and methods that provide us with important competitive advantages 
we cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will issue as patents or that no one will challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent that we own 
we also cannot be certain that if anyone does make such a challenge  that we will be able to successfully defend that challenge 
we may have to incur substantial litigation costs to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent or to protect our proprietary technologies and methods 
furthermore  competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies or design around the patented aspects of such technologies 
in addition  our proposed technologies could infringe patents or other rights owned by others  or others could infringe our patents 
we have filed suit in germany against tenaxis  inc because we believe that tenaxis is infringing our main bioglue patent in germany 
this company has filed a separate suit to nullify this same bioglue patent in germany 
should we be unsuccessful in our lawsuit regarding infringement of our bioglue patent or in prohibiting any other infringements of our patents  or should this nullity lawsuit filed by tenaxis be successful  or the validity of our patents be successfully challenged by a third party  our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we continue to investigate potential infringements of our us bioglue patents 
we protect our proprietary technologies and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners  employees  and consultants 
we cannot be sure that these entities and persons will not breach these agreements  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors 
if any of these events occur  they could result in our loss of the economic benefits associated with our key products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
uncertainties related to patents and protection of proprietary technology for products distributed by cryolife may adversely affect the ability of cryolife to distribute those products 
we distribute two products  hemostase and cardiowrap  which are manufactured by third parties 
these third parties have patents  licenses  and proprietary technologies that give their products competitive advantages 
others may challenge the validity or enforceability of these patents 
our contracts require that these third parties pursue infringements of patents owned or licensed by them for the products that we distribute 
we may choose to assist our third party manufacturers and may incur substantial costs in any efforts to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent or to protect proprietary technologies and methods 
we cannot be certain that if anyone does make such a challenge  that these third parties will be able to successfully defend that challenge  with or without our assistance 
furthermore  competitors could independently develop similar technologies  duplicate technologies  design around the patented aspects of such technologies  or attempt to duplicate proprietary technologies that have no patent protection 
in addition  these third parties technologies could infringe patents or other rights owned by others  or others could infringe these third parties patents or use their proprietary rights inappropriately 
we believe that an entity may be infringing the patent licensed by the company that supplies hemostase to us 
we have notified the supplier of hemostase about this potential infringement 
we are not able to predict what actions the supplier will take 
if the supplier does not take any action or if they are ultimately unsuccessful in their attempt to halt the infringement or in prohibiting other infringements of their patents or inappropriate uses of their company s proprietary technology  or should the validity of their licensed patents be successfully challenged  our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our existing insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover our actual claims liability 
our products and the tissues we process allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients using our products or tissues  and we have been and may be exposed to product liability claims 
following the fda order  lawsuits related to our tissue preservation services increased to unprecedented numbers for us 
these claims involved assertions that infections and related morbidity  including death  were the result of inadequacies in our procedures 
we maintain claims made insurance policies to mitigate our financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
as of december   we know of one pending lawsuit against us arising out of our allograft orthopaedic tissue preservation services 
we believe that our product liability insurance covers this lawsuit 
in addition other parties have made complaints against us that may result in lawsuits in future periods 
we ceased accepting orthopaedic tissue for processing in january our december  consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability of approximately  for the estimated cost of resolving this claim 
the amount recorded is an estimate and does not reflect actual settlement arrangements or final judgments  the latter of which could include punitive damages  nor does it represent cash set aside for the purpose of making payments 
this balance sheet also reflects a million liability which is included as a component of accrued expenses of million and other long term liabilities of million for the estimated cost of resolving unreported product liability claims 
we believe that the liability could be estimated to be as high as million  after including a reasonable margin for statistical fluctuations 
based on an actuarial valuation  we estimated that as of december   million of the accrual for unreported liability claims would be recoverable under our insurance policies 
these amounts represent management s estimate of the probable losses and anticipated recoveries for unreported liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  actual results may differ from this estimate 
our product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages 
if we are unsuccessful in arranging acceptable settlements of current or future product liability  or future securities class action or derivative claims  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage and liquid assets to meet these obligations 
additionally  if one or more claims in which we are a defendant  whether now pending or hereafter arising  should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  such verdict s could exceed our available insurance coverage and liquid assets 
if we are unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve the outstanding or any future claims  this will materially and adversely affect our financial position  profitability  and cash flows 
further  if the costs of pending or incurred but unreported product liability claims exceed our current estimates  our financial position  profitability  and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not have sufficient resources to pay the claims against us  we may be forced to cease operations or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws 
we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage in the future  we may be subject to additional future exposure from product liability claims 
additionally  insurance rates may be significantly higher than in the past  and insurers may provide less coverage  which may adversely impact our financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
in addition  should we be subject to liability  whether imposed by a court or the result of a settlement that results in a large insurance claim  our insurance rates could increase significantly 
our current product liability insurance policy is a six year claims made policy covering claims incurred during the period april  through march  and reported during the period april  through march  claims incurred prior to april  that have not been reported are uninsured 
any punitive damage components of claims are also uninsured 
we may be unable to successfully market hemostase 
part of our plans for future growth involves anticipated revenues from the sale of hemostase  a private label hemostatic agent 
we currently market hemostase pursuant to a distribution agreement for use in cardiac and vascular surgery in the us and for cardiac  vascular  and general surgery  other than orthopaedic and ear  nose and throat surgery  in certain international markets  subject to certain exclusions 
our ability to successfully market hemostase is subject to a number of risks  including the possibility that surgeons may not accept hemostase  we may be unable to effectively leverage our existing sales force to market hemostase  hemostase may not perform as expected or provide all expected benefits  other distributors of the hemostase product may interfere with or otherwise impede our ability to market the product to new or existing customers  and potential third party infringement of the patent under which hemostase in produced 
our credit facility limits our ability to pursue significant acquisitions 
our credit facility prohibits mergers and acquisitions other than certain permitted acquisitions 
permitted acquisitions include non hostile acquisitions that have been approved by the board of directors and or the stockholders of the target company  if after giving effect to the acquisition  there is no event of default under the credit facility and there is still at least million available to be borrowed under the credit facility 
the total consideration that we pay or are obligated to pay for all acquisitions consummated during the term of the credit facility  less the portion of any such consideration funded by the issuance of common or preferred stock  may not exceed a specified aggregate amount 
as a result  our ability to consummate acquisitions  and fully realize our growth strategy  may be materially and adversely affected 
our failure to adequately comply with government regulations could result in loss of revenues and customers as well as additional compliance expense 
the fda  certain international governments  and some states regulate the facilities and processes that we use 
for example  the fda  pursuant to regulations it promulgated under the public health service act  currently regulates human tissue 
these regulations establish requirements for donor testing and screening of human tissue and record keeping relating to these activities and impose certain registration and product listing requirements on establishments that process or distribute human tissue or cellular based products 
the fda has also implemented good tissue practice regulations akin to good manufacturing practices  which must be followed by tissue banks and processors of human tissue 
these regulations increase regulatory oversight of cryolife and other processors of human tissue 
the fda also regulates bioglue through its medical device regulations 
these medical device regulations include the establishment of requirements for manufacturer registration  good manufacturing practices through the quality system regulations  premarket approval  and medical device reporting 
our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda  and state and international regulatory authorities to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
certain of our facilities and processes are subject to international standards set by the international organization for standardization with respect to which our compliance is reviewed by our notified body 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we can be subject to sanctions  such as written observations of deficiencies made following inspections  warning letters  product recalls  fines  product seizures and consent decrees  all of which would be made available to the public 
such actions and publicity could affect our ability to market our products and services 
in the past  the fda has sent us notifications and warning letters relating to deficiencies in our compliance with fda requirements 
we were required to take measures to respond  including labeling our processed tissue with a warning 
we also were subject to the fda order  which decreased our revenues  increased our processing costs  and materially and adversely affected our revenues  financial position  profitability  and cash flows 
we cannot be certain that the fda  or state or international regulatory authorities will not request that we take additional steps to correct deficiencies that may be raised in the future 
correcting any such deficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
continued deflation of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could materially and adversely impact our business 
the majority of our foreign bioglue revenues are denominated in british pounds and euros  and as such are sensitive to changes in exchange rates 
in addition  a portion of our dollar denominated bioglue sales are made to customers in other countries who must convert local currencies into us dollars in order to purchase bioglue 
we also have balances  such as cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accruals that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency transactions and balances are sensitive to changes in exchange rates 
the recent devaluation of british pounds and euros in relation to the us dollar  should it continue or accelerate  or deflation of other currencies which affect our customers could materially reduce our bioglue revenue growth or could result in a material decrease in future revenues as compared to the comparable prior periods 
should this occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
the financial and credit liquidity crisis may adversely affect our ability to borrow money or raise capital 
if the financial and credit liquidity crisis were to continue or become more severe it may impact our ability to obtain money under our credit facility 
if the current financial and credit liquidity crisis continues or worsens  our lender may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to our line of credit 
in addition  if we determined that it was appropriate or necessary to raise funds in the future  the financial and credit liquidity crisis  if it continues or worsens  may make the future cost of raising funds through the debt or equity markets more expensive or make those markets unavailable 
if we were unable to use our line of credit or raise funds through debt or equity markets it could materially and adversely affect our liquidity or our ability to follow our key growth strategies outlined by our board of directors 
current economic conditions may impact demand for our products and tissues 
our products and tissue services are purchased by hospitals for use in surgeries 
we believe these hospitals have been negatively affected by the deterioration in the us and global economies in several ways 
for instance  hospitals are facing increased pressure from reduction in donations that support their operations 
in addition  hospitals face increased costs associated with patients being unable to pay their portion of their insurance and from having no insurance 
finally  hospitals have seen decreases in their profitable elective surgeries  further creating economic pressure 
the company believes that because of the deterioration in the us and global economies  hospitals have delayed replenishment of inventories or are carrying inventories at reduced levels  both of which reduce current purchases of cryolife s products and services 
although the company believes that hospitals will find it necessary to replenish their inventories in the future  there is no guarantee as to when or if they will do so  and if the economic crisis continues or worsens  they may further reduce their inventories or choose to use alternative or cheaper products or services 
intense competition may affect our ability to operate profitably 
we face competition from other companies engaged in the following lines of business the processing of human tissue  the marketing of mechanical valves and synthetic and animal tissue for implantation  and the marketing of surgical adhesives  surgical sealants  and hemostatic agents 
management believes that at least two domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for human heart valves and many companies offer processed porcine heart valves and mechanical heart valves  including st 
jude medical  inc  medtronic  inc  and edwards life sciences 
our bioglue product competes with other surgical adhesives and surgical sealants  including baxter international  inc s tisseel  and coseal  ethicon  inc s  a johnson johnson company  evicel  covidien  ltd 
s us surgical division s duraseal product  and tenaxis s arterx 
other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies may also be developing competitive products 
our bioglue product competes on the basis of its high tensile strength and ease of use 
our hemostase product competes with thrombin products  including king pharmaceuticals  inc s thrombin jmi  zymogenetics  inc 
s recothrom  and omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc s  a johnson and johnson company  evithrom  and surgical hemostats  including pfizer  inc s gelfoam  cr bard  inc s avitene  baxter international  inc 
s floseal  and ethicon  inc s surgicel  surgiflo  and surgifoam products 
in addition  starch medical  inc has a hemostatic product that has ce approval and that will compete in the future outside of the us we are also aware that a few companies have surgical hemostat products under development 
for example  omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc is currently developing a hemostatic patch for control of surgical bleeding that could compete with hemostase in certain applications 
other medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies may also be developing competitive products 
our hemostase product competes on the basis of its safety profile and ease of use 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  and marketing resources than we do and are well established in their markets 
we have increased fees and prices on a number of our services and products since january  this increase may provide an opportunity for our competitors to gain market share 
if we are unable to continue to increase prices as planned and retain or improve our market share  our ability to grow revenues and profits may be adversely affected 
we cannot give assurance that our products and services will be able to compete successfully 
any products that we develop that gain regulatory clearance or approval will have to compete for market acceptance and market share 
in addition  our competitors may gain competitive advantages that may be difficult to overcome 
if we fail to compete effectively  this could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
there are limitations on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards 
we estimate that as of our last measurement date  december   we had approximately million in us federal net operating loss carryforwards which could be used to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin to expire in the tax year 
we may be unable to generate enough profits  if any  prior to their expiration to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that we can utilize on an annual basis is capped after an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  a change in control of our company within the meaning of section could substantially reduce the annual benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards and could  thereby  result in a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused 
key growth strategies identified as a result of our strategic review may not generate the anticipated benefits 
in january we engaged a financial advisor to assist our management and board of directors in identifying and evaluating potential strategies to enhance shareholder value 
as a result of this review  the board of directors has directed management to actively pursue three key strategies to generate revenue and earnings growth in addition to continuing to focus on growing our business and leveraging our strengths and expertise in our core marketplaces 
these three strategies are identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies  licensing our technology to third parties for non competing uses  and analyzing and identifying underperforming assets for possible sale or other disposition 
although management has been implementing these strategies  we cannot be certain that they will ultimately enhance shareholder value 
our ability to borrow under our credit facility may be limited 
our credit facility contains a number of affirmative covenants that we must satisfy before we can borrow 
for example  we must satisfy specified leverage ratios  and there are also increasing levels of adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda under the credit facility that we have covenanted to maintain during the term of the credit facility 
failure to satisfy any of these requirements could limit our borrowing ability and materially and adversely affect our liquidity 
see financial and credit crisis may adversely affect our ability to borrow money or raise capital above 
we may not be successful in obtaining necessary clinical results and regulatory approvals for products and services in development  and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance 
our growth and profitability will depend  in part  upon our ability to complete development of and successfully introduce new products and services 
we are uncertain whether we can develop commercially acceptable new products and services 
we must also expend much time and money to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
although we have conducted preclinical studies on certain products under development which indicate that such products may be effective in a particular application  we cannot be certain that the results we obtain from expanded clinical studies will be consistent with earlier trial results or be sufficient for us to obtain any required regulatory approvals or clearances 
we cannot give assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from successfully developing  introducing  and marketing new products 
we also cannot give assurance that the regulatory agencies will clear or approve these or any new products on a timely basis  if ever  or that the new products will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance 
our ability to complete the development of any of our products is subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies 
such risks include unanticipated technical or other problems  manufacturing difficulties  and the possibility that we have allocated insufficient funds to complete such development 
consequently  we may not be able to successfully develop or manufacture our products which are under development 
if we do develop or manufacture these products  we may not do so on a timely basis 
these products may not meet price or performance objectives  and may not prove to be as effective as competing products 
if we are unable to successfully complete the development of a product  application  or service  or if we determine for financial  technical  or other reasons not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval of any product  application  or service  particularly in instances when we have expended significant capital  this could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive and we cannot be sure that these efforts will lead to commercially successful products or services 
even the successful commercialization of a new service or product in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing  under utilized production capacity  and continuing research and development and education costs 
the introduction of new products or services may require significant physician training and years of clinical evidence derived from follow up studies on human implant recipients in order to gain acceptance in the medical community 
new products or services could include the following new indications for our bioglue products  new products based on our protein hydrogel technology  including biofoam and biodisc  bioglue aesthetic  cryovalve sg aortic human heart valve  propatch  and synergraft processed animal heart valves and vascular tissue 
regulatory action outside of the us has affected our business in the past and may also affect our business in the future 
after the fda issued the fda order  discussed above  health canada also issued a recall of the same types of tissue 
in addition  other countries have made inquiries regarding the tissues that we export  although these inquiries are now  to our knowledge  complete 
in the event other countries raise additional regulatory concerns  we may be unable to export tissues to those countries 
regulatory concerns could also be raised regarding the other products we market internationally  including bioglue 
revenue from international human tissue preservation services was approximately million   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
international revenue from product sales  which includes international bioglue revenue  was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loss of all or a material portion of our international revenues would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
physicians have been and may continue to be reluctant to implant our preserved tissues or use our other products 
some physicians or implanting institutions have been reluctant to choose our preserved tissues for use in implantation  due to a perception that the tissue may not be safe or a belief that the implanting physician or hospital may be subject to a heightened liability risk if our tissues are used 
in addition  for similar reasons  some hospital risk managers have not allowed implanting surgeons to utilize our tissues when alternatives are available 
several risk managers and physicians have refused to use our products due to these concerns 
these conditions have materially and adversely affected demand for our preserved human tissues 
if these conditions recur  our results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected 
if implanting hospitals or physicians representing significant revenues refuse to use tissues that we preserve or our other products  including bioglue  and we are unable to replace the revenues lost  our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 
in the past  we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flows  and we must continue to address the underlying causes in order to continue to operate profitably and generate positive cash flows 
due principally to factors mentioned above  we suffered net losses in the years ended december  through and generated negative operating cash flow each year in the five year period ended december  there is no guarantee that we can continue to address the causes of our previous losses 
investments in new technologies and acquisitions of products or distribution rights may not be successful 
we may invest in new technology licenses  and acquire products or distribution rights that may not succeed in the marketplace 
in such cases  we may be unable to recover our initial investment  which could include acquiring license or distribution rights  acquiring products  or purchasing initial inventory 
inability to recover our initial investment may adversely impact our profitability 
if we are not successful in expanding our business activities in international markets  we will be unable to increase our revenues 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks we face in the us  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  including foreign distributor relationships  longer accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries and additional cost of collection of those receivables  adverse economic or political changes  more limited protection for intellectual property in some countries  changes in currency exchange rates  potential trade restrictions  exchange controls  and import and export licensing requirements  and potentially adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures 
our failure to adequately address these risks could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
future health care reimbursement methods and policies may affect the availability  amount  and timing of our revenues 
even though we do not receive payments directly from third party health care payors  their reimbursement methods and policies impact demand for our preserved tissue and other services and products 
our preservation services with respect to the cardiac and vascular tissues we preserve may be particularly susceptible to third party cost containment measures 
for example  the initial cost of a preserved human heart valve generally exceeds the cost of a mechanical  synthetic  or animal derived valve 
we are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods and policies utilized by third party health care payors or their effect on us 
if third party health care payors  including medicare  change their reimbursement methods and policies with respect to preserved tissues provided for implant by us and other services and products that we offer  this could have a material and adverse effect on us 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products and services  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available for us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in developing new products 
if government mandated health insurance is adopted  the demand for and prices obtained for our services and products could be negatively impacted because government mandated health insurance could result in higher cost surgeries not being approved or could limit the level of reimbursement for new products  such as the cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve 
government  hospitals  and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products approved for marketing by the fda 
in some cases  these entities refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for uses of our new products and services  market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
rapid technological change could cause our services and products to become obsolete 
the technologies underlying our products and services are subject to rapid and profound technological change 
competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known 
we can give no assurance that others will not develop products or processes with significant advantages over the products and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
extensive government regulation may adversely affect our ability to develop and sell products and services 
government regulation in the us  europe  the middle east  and africa  and other jurisdictions can determine the success of our and our competitors efforts to market and develop services and products 
most of our products and services in development and those of our competitors  if successfully developed  will require regulatory approvals from the fda and perhaps other regulatory authorities before they may be commercially distributed 
the process of obtaining premarket approvals from the fda normally involves clinical trials as well as an extensive premarket approval application and often takes many years 
in addition  the k notification process may also require clinical trials and take many years  for example the k clearance for the cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve took four years 
the process for approval from the fda is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity  and novelty of the product 
we cannot give any assurance that any products developed by us or our competitors  independently or in collaboration with others  will receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing 
delays in obtaining us or foreign approvals could result in substantial additional cost and adversely affect our competitive position 
the fda may also place conditions on product approvals that could restrict commercial applications of our products 
the fda may withdraw product marketing approvals or clearances if we do not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays imposed by the governmental clearance process may materially reduce the period during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize patented products 
delays or rejections may also be encountered by us during any stage of the regulatory approval process if clinical or other data fails to satisfactorily demonstrate compliance with  or if the product fails to meet  the regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy  and quality 
those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in applicable laws  regulatory agency policies  or the adoption of new regulations 
clinical trials may also be delayed due to the following unanticipated side effects  inability to locate  recruit  and qualify sufficient numbers of patients  lack of funding  the inability to locate or recruit clinical investigators  the redesign of clinical trial programs  the inability to manufacture or acquire sufficient quantities of the particular product or any other components required for clinical trials  changes in development focus  and disclosure of trial results by competitors 
even if we or one of our competitors are able to obtain regulatory approval for any products or services offered  the scope of the approval may significantly limit the indicated usage for which such products or services may be marketed 
the unapproved use of our products or our preserved tissues could adversely affect the reputation of our company and our products or services 
products or services marketed pursuant to fda or foreign oversight or approvals are subject to continuing regulation and periodic inspections 
labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the export of devices and biologics is also subject to regulation and may require fda approval 
from time to time  the fda may modify such regulations  imposing additional or different requirements 
if we fail to comply with applicable fda requirements  which may be ambiguous  we could face civil and criminal enforcement actions  warnings  citations  product recalls or detentions  and other penalties 
this could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
in addition  the national organ transplant act of  or nota  prohibits the acquisition or transfer of human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of human organs 
congress could adopt more restrictive interpretations of nota in the future that challenge one or more aspects of industry methods of charging for preservation services 
our laboratory operations and those of our competitors are subject to the us department of labor  occupational safety and health administration  and us environmental protection agency requirements for prevention of occupational exposure to infectious agents and hazardous chemicals and protection of the environment 
some states have enacted statutes and regulations which govern the processing  transportation  and storage of human organs and tissue 
the european union has three separate directives called the european union tissue and cells directives  euctd  that establish a benchmark standard for the regulation of tissues and cells to be implanted in humans 
the euctd requires that countries in the european economic area take responsibility for regulating tissue and cells through a competent authority 
although europa  cryolife s subsidiary  has a license to ship tissue into the united kingdom  and a provisional license to distribute tissue into germany through those countries competent authorities  these countries could change their regulations or processes  thereby increase the cost to cryolife and europa of distribution  or modify or eliminate the ability of the company and europa to distribute tissue into the united kingdom and germany 
in addition  europa ships tissue into austria  which currently has no competent authority 
when austria puts in place its competent authority  it could cause the company and europa to cease distribution of tissue into austria temporarily or permanently  or increase the costs to do so materially 
in addition  us and foreign governments and regulatory agencies may adopt more restrictive laws or regulations in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
our business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key field personnel and senior management  many of whom would be difficult to replace  including our ceo  steven g 
anderson  whose employment agreement expires in december our business and future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  processing  field  marketing  sales  and support personnel for our operations 
competition for such personnel is intense and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
we do not have key life insurance policies on any of our key personnel 
if we lose any key employees  if any of our key employees fail to perform adequately  or if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees as needed  this could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
risks related to our common stock trading prices for our common stock  and for the securities of biotechnology companies in general  have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations and may continue to be volatile in the future 
trading price fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including variations in operating results  regulatory actions such as the adverse fda activity  product liability claims  announcement of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory acts  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the medical device or service industries  actions taken by government regulators  and changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts 
if our revenues or operating results in future quarters fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
if our share prices do not meet the requirements of the new york stock exchange  our shares may be delisted 
the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a high of to a low of in the period from january  to december  in addition  changes in the trading price of our common stock may bear no relation to our actual operational or financial results 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  companies that experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation 
moreover  market prices for stocks of biotechnology and technology companies frequently reach levels that bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
these market prices generally are not sustainable and are highly volatile 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs  divert our management s attention and resources  and materially and adversely affect our revenues  financial position  profitability  and cash flows 
anti takeover provisions may discourage or make more difficult an attempt to obtain control of cryolife 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or make more difficult any attempt by a person or group to obtain control of our company  including provisions authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  restricting the persons who may call a special meeting of the shareholders  and prohibiting shareholders from taking action by written consent 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions of florida law that may discourage or make more difficult takeover attempts or acquisitions of substantial amounts of our common stock 
further  pursuant to the terms of a shareholder rights plan adopted in and amended in  each outstanding share of common stock has one attached right 
the rights will cause substantial dilution of the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire our company on terms not approved by the board of directors and may deter hostile takeover attempts 
these provisions could potentially deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our stock at above market prices 
we are not likely to pay common stock dividends in the foreseeable future  and we may not be able to pay cash dividends on our capital stock due to legal or contractual restrictions 
we have not paid  and do not presently intend to pay  cash dividends on our common stock 
in addition our credit agreement prohibits us from paying cash dividends  and under florida law we may not be able to pay cash dividends on our capital stock 
under florida law  no distribution may be paid on our capital stock  if after giving it effect we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any preferred shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
the terms of any future financing arrangements that we may enter into may also restrict our ability to pay dividends

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cryolife  inc cryolife  the company  we  or us  incorporated january  in florida  preserves and distributes human tissues for cardiac and vascular transplant applications and develops and commercializes medical devices 
the human tissue distributed by the company includes the cryovalve sg pulmonary human heart valve cryovalve sg  processed using cryolife s proprietary synergraft technology 
the company s medical devices include bioglue surgical adhesive bioglue and hemostase  which the company distributes for medafor  inc medafor  as well as other medical devices 
for the year ended december  cryolife reached a milestone by surpassing million in revenue for the first time in company history  as revenues totaled million 
additionally  in the company achieved eight consecutive quarters of profitability for the first time since the company s profitability in was increased by million due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
see deferred income taxes and results of operations section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year results 
see part i  item  business  for further discussion of the company s business and activities during critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in part ii  item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
liability claims in the normal course of business  the company has tissue processing and product liability complaints filed against it 
as of february  one tissue processing liability lawsuit was pending against the company arising out of the allograft orthopaedic tissue preservation services previously provided by the company 
management believes this lawsuit is covered by liability insurance 
this lawsuit is currently in the discovery stage and expert witnesses are also being deposed 
other parties have made complaints that may result in lawsuits in future periods 
based on an analysis the company performed as of december  and  the company accrued a total of approximately  for the pending tissue processing liability lawsuit 
the  accrual was included as a component of accrued expenses on the december  and consolidated balance sheets 
on april  the company bound liability coverage for the insurance policy year 
this policy is a six year claims made insurance policy  ie claims incurred during the period april  through march  and reported during the period april  through march  are covered by this policy 
claims incurred prior to april  that have not been reported are uninsured 
any punitive damage components of claims are also uninsured 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to tissue processing and product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to unreported tissue processing and product liability claims and records accruals as necessary for the estimated cost of unreported claims related to services performed and products used 
the company updated its estimates of the unreported claims as of december  the unreported loss liability was estimated using a frequency severity approach  whereby projected losses were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims were calculated based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim was calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the company used a number of assumptions in order to estimate the unreported loss liability including a ceiling of million was selected for actuarial purposes in determining the liability per claim given the uncertainty in projecting claim losses in excess of million  the future claim reporting lag time would be a blend of the company s experiences and industry data  the frequency of unreported claims included with respect to accident years through would be lower than the company s experience in the policy year  but higher than the company s historical claim frequency prior to the policy year  the average cost per claim would be lower than the company s experience since the policy year  but higher than the company s historical cost per claim prior to the policy year  the average cost per bioglue claim would be consistent with the company s overall historical exposures until adequate historical data is available on this product line  and the number of bioglue claims per million dollars of bioglue revenue would be lower than non bioglue claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on bioglue claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary 
the company believes that these assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the calculation of the unreported liability loss  but the accuracy of the estimates is limited by the general uncertainty that exists for any estimate of future activity due to uncertainties surrounding the assumptions used and due to company specific conditions and the scarcity of industry data directly relevant to the company s business activities 
due to these factors  actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used and amounts accrued 
the company estimated that its liability for unreported tissue processing and product liability claims was million as of december  the million balance is included as a component of accrued expenses of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
further analysis indicated that the liability could be estimated to be as high as million  after including a reasonable margin for statistical fluctuations calculated based on actuarial simulation techniques 
the company estimated that as of december   million of the accrual for unreported liability claims would be recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
the million insurance recoverable is included as a component of other receivables of  and other long term assets of  on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
these amounts represent management s estimate of the probable losses and anticipated recoveries for unreported liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  actual results may differ from this estimate 
as of december  the company accrued million for unreported liability claims and recorded a receivable of million for unreported liability claims estimated to be recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
this million accrual was included as a component of accrued expenses of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the million insurance recoverable was included as a component of other current receivables of million and other long term assets of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
deferred preservation costs by federal law  human tissues cannot be bought or sold 
therefore  the tissues the company preserves and further processes cannot be held as inventory 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by tissue banks and organ procurement organizations  which consign the tissue to the company for processing  preservation  and distribution 
preservation costs consist primarily of direct labor and materials including salary and fringe benefits  laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  and freight in charges and indirect costs including allocations of costs from departments that support processing activities and facility allocations 
although the company cannot own human tissue  the preservation process is a manufacturing process that is accounted for in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
chapter inventory pricing 
preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to the implanting facilities 
cost of preservation services also includes idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  extra freight  and rehandling costs and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
inventory costs 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the costs included in deferred preservation costs contain several estimates due to the timing differences between the occurrence of the cost and receipt of final bills for services 
costs that contain estimates include tissue procurement fees  which are estimated based on the company s contracts with independent procurement agencies  and freight in charges  which are estimated based on the company s prior experiences with these charges 
these costs are adjusted for differences between estimated and actual fees when invoices for these services are received 
management believes that its estimates approximate the actual costs of these services  but estimates could differ from actual costs 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among the different tissues processed during the period based on specific cost drivers such as the number of donors and the number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management believes that this estimate is an appropriate approximation of the tissue that will ultimately become implantable 
management determines this estimate of quarantine yields based on its experience in prior periods and reevaluates this estimate periodically 
due to the nature of this estimate and the length of the processing times experienced by the company  actual yields could differ from the company s estimates 
a significant change in quarantine yields could materially impact the amount of deferred preservation costs on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the cost of preservation services  including the lower of cost or market write down  described below  on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value and to determine if there are any impairments to the book value of the company s deferred preservation costs 
cryolife records a charge to cost of preservation services to write down the amount of deferred preservation costs that are not deemed to be recoverable 
these write downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis  which cannot be restored to its previous levels when tissues are shipped or become available for shipment 
the company recorded write downs of  for the twelve months ended december  due to the impairment of certain vascular tissues and  for the twelve months ended december  due to the impairment of certain vascular and orthopaedic tissues 
the tissues were impaired in the period that the company determined that the tissues were not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of the tissue s packaging 
the company recorded write downs of  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  for the value of certain deferred preservation costs that exceeded market value 
these write downs were primarily due to excess tissue processing costs incurred in those periods that exceeded market value based on then recent average service fees 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for allograft heart valve tissues  million for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues and zero for orthopaedic tissues 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for allograft heart valve tissues  million for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and  for orthopaedic tissues 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company generated deferred tax assets primarily as a result of write downs of deferred preservation costs  accruals for tissue processing and product liability claims  and operating losses 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
management provides a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset when  as a result of this analysis  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the company performed an analysis in accordance with sfas of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
this analysis included consideration of a variety of factors  which included the company s historical operating results and uncertainties regarding projected future operating results 
the company concluded that a valuation allowance was needed on its deferred tax assets as of december  the company performed additional assessments as of march   june   and september  and determined at each of these dates that a valuation allowance was needed on its deferred tax assets 
the company reassessed its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and the appropriate levels of the valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
 as of december  in conducting this assessment  management considered a variety of factors  including the company s operating profits for the years ended december  and  the reasons for the company s operating losses in prior years  and management s judgment as to the likelihood of continued profitability and expectations of future performance  and other factors 
based on this analysis  as of december  the company determined that maintaining a full valuation on its deferred tax assets was no longer appropriate 
as a result  on december  the company recorded a tax benefit of million on its consolidated statement of operations to reverse substantially all of the valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
the company continued to maintain valuation allowances on a portion of its deferred tax assets  primarily related to state tax net operating loss carryforwards that the company does not believe it will be able to utilize based on its projections of profitability in certain states  and state carryforward rules and limitations 
in future periods the company will assess the recoverability of its deferred tax assets as necessary when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its prior determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards  and a net deferred tax asset of million 
as of december  the company had a total of million in valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and a net deferred tax liability of  related to taxes in a foreign jurisdiction 
the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets could be limited in future periods following a change in control as mandated by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which relates to certain specified changes in control of taxpayers 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
impairments of long lived assets the company assesses the potential impairment of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  or significant decline in the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires the write down of a long lived asset to be held and used if the carrying value of the asset or the asset group to which the asset belongs is not recoverable 
the carrying value of the asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
for the years ended december  and the company did not experience any factors that indicated an sfas impairment review was warranted 
for the year ended december  the company performed an sfas impairment analysis  due to a variety of triggering factors  including its operating performance 
per management s analysis  the undiscounted future cash flows of the company s asset groups exceeded their carrying values as of december  therefore  management concluded that there was not an impairment of the company s long lived tangible and amortizing intangible assets 
sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that non amortizing intangible assets are subjected to impairment testing on an annual basis and  if necessary  during interim periods if factors indicate that an impairment review is warranted 
the company s non amortizing intangible assets as of december  consisted of trademarks and procurement agreements  including procurement contracts and access to the procurement of cardiac and vascular human tissues received from a third party as a result of an agreement entered into in in accordance with sfas  the company performed an analysis of its non amortizing intangible assets as of december  and during this analysis  the company determined that the fair value of the assets exceeded their carrying value 
based on the results of its analysis  the company does not believe that an impairment existed related to its non amortizing intangible assets as of december  or management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of these non amortizing intangible assets on an annual basis in accordance with sfas new accounting pronouncements the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
r business combinations sfas r  for the fiscal year beginning january  sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on its financial position  profitability  or cash flows upon adoption 
all business combinations consummated after the implementation date will be accounted for under sfas r 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues revenues increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  a detailed discussion of the change in preservation services revenues for each of the three major tissue types distributed by the company  the change in bioglue revenues  and the change in other medical device revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  is presented below 
cardiac preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues cardiac revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from cardiac preservation services decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the aggregate impact of a decrease in unit shipments of cardiac tissues partially offset by the favorable effect of tissue mix  which together decreased revenues by  and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to the aggregate impact of favorable tissue mix and a increase in unit shipments of cardiac tissues  which together increased revenues by  and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by the decrease in revenues from the net effect of volume and tissue mix for the three months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of standard processed pulmonary valves 
this decrease was largely offset by an increase in shipments of the cryovalve sg 
the net decrease in aggregate pulmonary valve shipments which includes both standard processed pulmonary valves and cryovalve sgs had a minimal effect on revenues  due to favorable tissue mix  as the cryovalve sg demands premium fees over standard processed pulmonary valves 
the remaining cardiac volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of non valved cardiac tissues and aortic valves 
management believes that there has not been a corresponding decrease in the number of procedures in which the company s aortic and pulmonary valves are utilized 
however  management believes that due to the current economic conditions and its constraining effect on hospital budgets  that hospitals are decreasing the number of valved cardiac tissues they keep on hand for urgent procedures 
the decrease in shipments of non valved cardiac tissues was primarily due to the timing of releases of these tissues  which are in high demand for pediatric surgeries 
the favorable tissue mix and volume increase for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the impact of cryovalve sg shipments and to a lesser extent due to the increase in shipments of aortic valves 
on february  the fda cleared the company s k premarket notification for the cryovalve sg and as a result  the company reintroduced the cryovalve sg in march of due to the reintroduction of the cryovalve sg  shipments of standard processed pulmonary valves decreased 
the net effect of this change in tissue mix was favorable  despite a similar number of units shipped  as the cryovalve sg demands premium fees over standard processed pulmonary valves 
for the three and twelve months ended december   cryovalve sg revenues accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total cardiac preservation service revenues 
the increases in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the fee increases that went into effect in january on most standard processed cardiac tissues and due to the routine expiration or renegotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
the company s procurement of cardiac tissues  from which heart valves and non valved cardiac tissues are processed  decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the company s procurement of cardiac tissues for the twelve months ended december  was consistent with procurement for the twelve months ended december  as a part of the normal course of business  cryolife routinely adjusts its criteria for accepting incoming tissue based on certain variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that certain tissues will pass the company s quality controls and testing processes  changes in demand for certain types of tissues processed by the company  changes in incoming tissue availability  and the level of tissues currently available for shipment 
the decrease in cardiac procurement in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  was primarily the result of changes in tissue acceptance criteria made during if these changes remain in effect  the company believes that cardiac procurement will continue at these reduced levels into as compared to prior year periods 
however  the company may continue to make changes in incoming tissue acceptance criteria  and as a result the company s level of procurement may continue to vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the company believes that its existing cardiac tissues available for shipment and current procurement levels are sufficient to support anticipated future demand for cardiac tissues for the reasonably foreseeable future 
the company may continue to experience a decrease in cardiac valve shipments into the company believes that the trend of decreasing cardiac valve shipments will reverse sometime during as hospitals begin to maintain on hand tissues at reduced levels 
however  there can be no assurance that this trend will reverse 
the company believes that cardiac revenues in will be favorably impacted by shipments of the cryovalve sg  which have a premium fee over the standard processed cryovalve 
however  there can be no assurance that the cryovalve sg will continue to command premium fees or that shipments of the cryovalve sg will continue to occur at material levels 
vascular preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues vascular revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues 
revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by  and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the increase in vascular volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of each of the types of vascular tissues processed by the company 
the largest volume increases were in saphenous veins  which increased due to the strong demand for these tissues  primarily for use in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations 
the increase in average service fees for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the fee increases that went into effect in january on most vascular tissues and due to the routine expiration or renegotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
the company s procurement of vascular tissues decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the company s procurement of vascular tissues decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  as a part of the normal course of business  cryolife routinely adjusts its criteria for accepting incoming tissue based on certain variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that certain tissues will pass the company s quality controls and testing processes  changes in demand for certain types of tissues processed by the company  changes in incoming tissue availability  and the level of tissues currently available for shipment 
the decrease in vascular procurement in the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  was primarily the result of changes in tissue acceptance criteria made during if these changes remain in effect  the company believes that vascular procurement will continue at these reduced levels through as compared to the prior year periods 
however  the company may continue to make changes in incoming tissue acceptance criteria  and as a result the company s level of procurement may continue to vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
the company believes that its existing vascular tissues available for shipment and current procurement levels are sufficient to support anticipated future demand for vascular tissues for the reasonably foreseeable future 
orthopaedic preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues orthopaedic revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from orthopaedic preservation services decreased and for the three and twelve months ended december   as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to significant decreases in unit shipments of orthopaedic tissues  due to the cessation of the company s orthopaedic marketing efforts as of june   pursuant to its agreement with rti 
the decrease was also due to the limited supply of orthopaedic tissues available for shipment  resulting from the company s cessation of procuring and processing these tissues on january   and declining demand for the company s orthopaedic tissues 
for a commission  rti was able to market and direct cryolife to ship the company s remaining orthopaedic tissues from july  through december  these marketing efforts by rti generated minimal revenues during the three months ended december  bioglue three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues bioglue revenues as a percentage of total revenue revenues from the sale of bioglue increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by  and a increase in the number of bioglue milliliters shipped  which increased revenues by  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange  which reduced revenues by 
revenues from the sale of bioglue increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by  and a increase in the number of bioglue milliliters shipped  which increased revenues by 
the increase in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended december  were primarily due to domestic list price increases that went into effect in january and the routine expiration or renegotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
the volume increase for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in sales of bioglue syringes in domestic and international markets  partially offset by a related decrease in bioglue cartridge sales 
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange for the three months ended december  was due to changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound and the euro from the prior year period 
domestic revenues accounted for of total bioglue revenues in both of the three month periods ended december  and domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the company s international bioglue revenues are denominated in british pounds and euros  and as such are sensitive to changes in exchange rates 
in addition  a portion of the company s dollar denominated bioglue sales are made to customers in other countries who must convert local currencies into us dollars in order to purchase bioglue 
as a result the company s revenues in could be negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates from the weighted average exchange rates experienced by the company in the prior year periods and by declining demand from foreign customers who may be impacted by changes in exchange rates 
other medical devices three months ended december  twelve months ended december  revenues other medical devices revenues as a percentage of total revenues revenues from the sale of other medical devices increased and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  the increases in revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  were primarily due to sales of hemostase  which cryolife began distributing during the second quarter of hemostase revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  were  and million  respectively 
other medical device revenues in consisted of sales of hemostase  cardiowrap  and bioprosthetic devices 
other medical device revenues in consisted of sales of cardiowrap and bioprosthetic devices 
other revenues three months ended december  twelve months ended december  grant and licensing revenues grant and licensing revenues as a percentage of total revenue other revenues for the three months ended december  included revenues from research grants 
other revenues for the three months ended december  included revenues from research grants and revenues related to the licensing of the company s technology to a third party 
other revenues for the twelve months ended december  and included revenues from research grants and revenues related to the licensing of the company s technology to a third party 
in   and cryolife was awarded  million  and  respectively  in funding allocated from us congress defense appropriations conference reports  the dod grant  dod grant  and dod grant  respectively 
these grants were awarded for the development of protein hydrogel technology  which the company is currently developing for use in organ sealing 
grant revenues in and are related to funding under one or more of these grants for the development of biofoam 
the defense appropriations conference report the dod grant included million for the continued development of protein hydrogel technology 
cryolife anticipates applying for funding under this bill in the company does not currently know if it will be approved to receive funding under the dod grant or when decisions concerning the funding will be made 
through december  cryolife had received cash payments for all funds awarded under the and dod grants  and a portion of the dod grant  for a total of million
