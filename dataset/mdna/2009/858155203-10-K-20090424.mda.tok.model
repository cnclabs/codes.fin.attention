we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
from time to time  we obtain a controlling interest in dealers that are undergoing an ownership transition 
it is typically our intent to divest our interest in these dealerships as soon as it is practical 
in  the north america segment recorded revenue of  or of our consolidated revenue  and as of the end of the year had approximately  employees  of which approximately  related to manufacturing 
the north america office furniture market is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products 
in these markets  companies compete on insight  product performance  design  price and relationships with customers  architects and designers

polyvision designs and manufactures visual communication products  such as static and electronic whiteboards 
the majority of polyvision s revenue relates to the manufacturing of steel and ceramic surfaces and the fabrication of related static whiteboards sold in the primary and secondary education markets in the us and europe 
in  polyvision exited a portion of the public bid contractor whiteboard fabrication business and transferred corporate whiteboard and certain other corporate technology products to the steelcase brand in the north america segment 
polyvision s revenue generated from electronic whiteboards and group communication tools are sold through audio visual resellers and our north america dealer network 
ideo is an innovation and design firm that uses a human centered  design based approach to generate new offerings and build new capabilities for its customers 
ideo serves steelcase and a variety of other organizations within consumer products  financial services  healthcare  information technology  government  transportation and other industries 
we have a collaborative relationship with ideo which generates innovative solutions and customer experience insights 
in  we entered into an agreement which will allow certain members of the management of ideo to purchase a controlling equity interest in ideo in two phases by the agreement provides that  under any circumstance  we will retain a minimum equity interest in ideo  and we expect to continue our collaborative relationship with ideo during and after this ownership transition 
as of february   ideo management effectively purchased of ideo under the first phase of the agreement 
phase two of the agreement begins in and allows ideo management to purchase an additional equity interest 
phase two also includes a variable compensation program that may provide ideo management with a portion of the funding for the remaining purchase 
in  the other category accounted for  or of our total revenue  and as of the end of the year had approximately  employees  of which approximately related to manufacturing 

table of contents corporate expenses approximately of corporate expenses were charged to the operating segments in as part of a corporate allocation 
unallocated corporate expenses are reported as corporate 
corporate costs include executive and portions of shared service functions such as information technology  human resources  finance  corporate facilities  legal and research and development 
joint ventures and other equity investments we enter into joint ventures and other equity investments from time to time to expand or maintain our geographic presence  support our distribution network or invest in complementary products and services 
as of february   our investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures and other equity investments was our portion of the income or loss from the joint ventures and other equity investments is recorded in other income  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
customer and dealer concentrations our largest direct sale customer accounted for of our consolidated revenue in and our five largest direct sale customers accounted for of consolidated revenue 
however  these percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies and other entities purchasing under our us general services administration contract  which in aggregate accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end use customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
working capital our accounts receivable are primarily from our dealers  and to a lesser degree  direct sale customers 
payment terms vary by country and region 
the terms of our north america segment  and certain markets within the international segment  encourage prompt payment by offering a discount 
other international markets have  by market convention  longer payment terms 
we are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large 
backlog our products are generally manufactured and shipped within two to six weeks following receipt of order  therefore  we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer term shipments 
global manufacturing and supply chain manufacturing and logistics we have manufacturing operations throughout north america  europe principally in france  germany and spain and in asia principally in china and malaysia 
we have evolved our manufacturing and supply chain systems significantly over the past several years by implementing lean manufacturing principles 
in particular  we have focused on implementing continuous one piece flow  streamlining our product offerings and developing a global network of integrated suppliers 
any operation which cannot be part of one piece flow may be evaluated to see whether outside partners would offer better levels of service  quality and cost 
our global manufacturing 
table of contents operations are centralized under a single organization to serve our customers needs across multiple brands and geographies 
this approach has reduced the capital needs of our business  inventories and the footprint of our manufacturing space while at the same time  allowing us to improve quality  delivery performance and the customer experience 
we continue to identify opportunities to eliminate excess capacity and redundancy while continuing to focus on our growth strategies 
we recently announced we will be closing additional manufacturing facilities in the us and canada in and relocating the majority of their operations to other north america manufacturing facilities 
in addition to our continued focus on enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort 
we have capitalized on raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost suppliers around the globe 
this global view of potential sources of supply has enhanced our leverage with domestic supply sources  and we have been able to reduce cycle times through improvements from all levels throughout the supply chain 
our physical distribution system utilizes dedicated fleet  commercial transport and company owned delivery services 
over the past several years  we have implemented a network of regional distribution centers to reduce freight costs and improve service to our dealers and customers 
some of these distribution centers are located within our manufacturing facilities  and we have contracted with third party logistics providers to operate some of these regional distribution centers 
raw materials and energy prices we source raw materials and components from a significant number of suppliers around the world 
those raw materials include steel and other metals  plastics  fabrics  wood  paint and other materials and components 
to date  we have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining these raw materials 
the prices for certain commodities such as steel  aluminum  wood  particleboard and petroleum based products have fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
our global supply chain team continually evaluates current market conditions  the financial viability of our suppliers and available supply options on the basis of cost  quality and reliability of supply 
research  design and development our extensive global research a combination of user observations  feedback sessions and sophisticated network analysis has helped us develop social  spatial and informational insights into work effectiveness 
we maintain exclusive and collaborative relationships with external world class innovators  including leading universities  think tanks and knowledge leaders  to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work 
understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe 
our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs 
these solutions vary from furniture  architecture and technology solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products and across different vertical market applications such as healthcare  higher education and professional services 
organizationally  global design leadership directs strategy and project work  which is distributed to design studios across our major businesses and often involves external design services 
our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria  including financial return metrics  and chooses which products will be developed and launched 
designers then work closely with engineers and suppliers to co develop products and processes that incorporate innovative user features and lead to more efficient manufacturing 
products are tested for performance  quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations 
exclusive of royalty payments  we invested  and in research  design and development activities in  and  respectively 
we continue to invest approximately one to 
table of contents two percent of our revenue in research  design and development each year 
royalties are sometimes paid to external designers of our products as the products are sold 
these costs are not included in the research  design and development costs since they are variable  based on product sales 
intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business 
we also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 
we do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks  or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such  except the steelcase  turnstone  polyvision  designtex  ideo  nurture by steelcase and coalesse trademarks 
we occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products  designs or process technology 
we have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our subsidiaries 
we also selectively license our intellectual property to third parties as a revenue source 
employees as of february   we had approximately  employees including  hourly employees and  salaried employees 
additionally  we had approximately temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing 
approximately employees in the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
internationally approximately  employees are covered by workers councils that operate to promote the interests of workers 
management believes we have positive relations with our employees 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment environmental laws 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws 
we do not believe existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
under certain environmental laws  we could be held liable  without regard to fault  for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations 
we could also be held responsible for third party property and personal injury claims or for violations of environmental laws relating to contamination 
we are a party to  or otherwise involved in  proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under environmental laws  including as a potentially responsible party in several superfund site cleanups 
based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  other financially viable potentially responsible parties and the total estimated cleanup costs  we do not believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material  either individually or in the aggregate 
we have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs 
however  certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves 
these events include  but are not limited to a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements  undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing toward cleanup costs

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
business cycles and other changes in demand could adversely impact our revenue and profits 
office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of cyclical macroeconomic factors such as corporate profits  non residential fixed investment  white collar employment growth and commercial office construction and vacancy rates 
our product sales are directly tied to corporate capital spending  which is outside of our control 
geopolitical uncertainties  terrorist attacks  acts of war  natural disasters  other world events or combinations of such and other factors outside of our control could also have a significant effect on business confidence and the global economy and therefore  our business 
other demand influences on our industry include the evolving nature of collaborative and distributed work  technology changes  organizational changes  employee health and safety concerns and the globalization of companies 
the trend towards off shoring white collar jobs could cause our major customers in our core markets to shift employment growth to countries where our market share is not as strong 
if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to these changes and trends  our revenues and profits may be adversely impacted 
the current deteriorating global economic conditions and financial markets may adversely affect our business 
the recent distress in the financial market has resulted in extreme volatility in the capital markets and diminished liquidity and credit availability 
there can be no assurance our access to liquidity will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy 
in addition  deterioration in our financial results could negatively impact our credit ratings 
the tightening of the credit markets or a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs and make it more difficult for us to access funds  refinance our existing indebtedness  enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities 

table of contents in addition  the stress in the credit markets is having a significant negative impact on many businesses around the world 
the current credit market could adversely impact our customers  dealers and suppliers as follows if our customers have difficulty in accessing the necessary liquidity for their operations  they may be unable to allocate capital for the purchase of our products and services  or they may be unable to pay amounts owed to our dealers or us 
additionally  our customers may seek to renegotiate contract prices as a result of the economic downturn and reduced capital spending 
we rely largely on a network of independent and company owned dealers to market  deliver and install our products to customers 
customer concentration within some of our dealers is relatively high 
if our dealers are unable to access liquidity or become insolvent  they may be unable to deliver required products and services and unable to pay amounts owed to us 
if our suppliers are unable to access liquidity or become insolvent  they may be unable to deliver raw materials or component parts and labor 
in addition  some of our suppliers also serve the automotive industry 
any adverse impacts to the automotive industry  as a result of the economic slowdown or stress in the credit markets  could have a ripple effect on these suppliers which could adversely impact their ability to supply us necessary parts or labor 
any such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to deliver products and services to our dealers and or customers  which in turn could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in response to the recent economic downturn and declines in our revenue  in q we announced a number of reductions to the compensation and benefits of our north american workforce 
we expect to reverse these reductions when general economic conditions improve 
in addition  the decline in our revenue has had and will continue to have a negative impact on the amount of performance based incentive compensation earned by our employees 
while we do not expect these events will have a significant impact on our ability to retain our employees in the near term  as the global economy improves  our ability to attract and retain appropriately skilled employees may be negatively impacted if we do not offer market competitive levels of compensation and benefits 
we may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategies 
we believe our future success depends upon our ability to deliver a great experience to our customers  which includes innovative  well made products and world class processes 
our success relies in part on our research and development and engineering efforts  our ability to manufacture or source the products and customer acceptance of our products 
as it relates to new markets  our success also depends on our ability to create and implement local supply chain and distribution strategies to reach these markets 
the potential inability to successfully implement and manage our growth strategies could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
our growth strategies call for expansion in existing markets by leveraging our current distribution to win new customers and more fully serve existing customers and their installed base of our products 
expansion in new adjacent markets such as the mid market segment of the office furniture market firms with to employees  vertical markets such as healthcare and higher education and progressive live work solutions through multiple or alternate channels 
expansion in emerging markets growth in emerging markets is subject to the risk factors listed below relating to our global operations but also include other risks 
as we hire new people and establish new processes in these locations  we are implementing our global business standards  but there is some risk our activities could expose us to liabilities 

table of contents investments in new business development initiatives which  like many startups  could have a relatively high failure rate 
we limit our investments in these initiatives and have governance procedures to contain the associated risks  but losses could result and may be material 
potential investments in acquisitions  joint venture alliances and additional channels of distribution 
we may not be able to enter into acquisitions or joint venture arrangements on acceptable terms  and we may not successfully integrate these activities into our operations 
we also may not be successful in implementing new distribution channels  and changes could create discord in our existing channels of distribution 
the successful implementation of our growth strategies will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain an appropriately skilled workforce 
competition for highly skilled and talented employees could result in higher compensation costs  difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce and leadership succession planning challenges 
we could be adversely affected by changes in raw material and commodity costs 
we procure raw materials from a significant number of sources within the us  canada  mexico  europe and asia 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the cost of steel  aluminum  wood  particleboard  petroleum based products and other commodities  such as fuel and energy  has fluctuated significantly in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
these changes can also lead to supply interruptions 
our gross margins could be affected if these types of costs continue to fluctuate 
in the short term  rapid changes in raw material costs can be very difficult to offset with price increases because of contractual agreements we have entered into with our customers 
it is difficult to find effective financial instruments to hedge against these risks 
we may not be successful in passing along a portion of higher raw materials costs to our customers because of competitive pressures 
disruptions to the supply of raw materials  component parts and labor in our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our supply chain management 
we are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials and components from third party suppliers and our own manufacturing operations 
the flow of such materials and components may be affected by fluctuations in the availability and quality of the raw materials  disruptions caused by labor activities  the financial solvency of our suppliers  especially in light of the current limited credit environment  and damage and loss or disruption of production from accidents  natural disasters and other causes 
our migration to a less vertically integrated manufacturing model has increased our reliance on a global network of suppliers 
any disruptions in the supply and delivery of component parts and products or deficiencies in our ability to develop and manage our network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully 
the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
we compete on a variety of factors  including brand recognition and reputation  price  lead time  delivery and service  insight from our research  product design and features  product quality  strength of dealers and other distributors and relationships with customers and key influencers  such as architects  designers and facility managers 
in the north america segment  our top competitors in our primary markets are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  inc  kimball international inc and knoll  inc  and our competitors 
table of contents generally offer products which are similar to the products we offer 
some of our competitors may have lower cost structures and a broader offering of moderately priced products  potentially making it more difficult for us to compete in certain customer segments 
in addition  such competition may prevent us from maintaining or raising the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures or in an industry downturn 
although we do not have major offshore competitors in our north america segment  there are other segments of the north america furniture industry  notably the residential furniture and made to stock office furniture segments sold through retailers  where lower cost imports have become dominant 
while customer lead time and customization requirements are currently inhibiting factors  it is possible we could see increased competition from imports in our core markets 
in the international segment  we compete against a larger number of smaller size competitors 
our north america competitors also compete in some of our international markets  but their market share varies significantly by market 
most of our top competitors have strong relationships with their existing customers that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders 
these competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and can develop products that could have a competitive advantage over steelcase products 
in certain markets  we compete using an import model which requires longer lead times than local competitors with domestic supply chains  and poses foreign currency exposures that we may not be able to hedge entirely 
we also compete in adjacent markets such as healthcare and higher education where competition is more fragmented 
we could face increased competition from incumbent players as well as difficulty in penetrating related channels of distribution which could impact our success in these markets 
our continued success depends upon many things  including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality  high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to evolve our business model and implement world class processes to enable us to effectively compete in the office furniture and adjacent industries 
our success is also dependent on our ability to sustain our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brand and our trademarks effectively as we enter new markets 
our global operations subject us to risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have sales offices and manufacturing facilities in many countries  and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
our global operations are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture  design  develop or sell products in particular countries  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including political  social and economic conditions  intellectual property protection  differing employment practices and labor issues  local business and cultural factors that differ from our global business standards and practices  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries  nationalization of our operations and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings  and natural disasters  security concerns  including crime  political instability  terrorist activity  armed conflict and civil or military unrest  and global health issues 
in the us and most countries in europe  our revenue and costs are typically in the same currency 
however  there are some situations where we export and import products in different currencies 
we also may hold assets  such as equity investments  real estate investments and cash balances  or carry 
table of contents liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business  and changes in currency controls with respect to such countries  could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  changes in tariff and import regulations and changes to us and international monetary policies may also negatively impact our revenue 
disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business 
we rely largely on a network of independent and company owned dealers to market  deliver and install our products to customers 
our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers 
from time to time  an individual dealer or steelcase may choose to terminate the relationship  or the dealership could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership 
in addition  our competitors could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert a number of our dealers to carry their products 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty  we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership  reducing the risk of disruption  but increasing our financial exposure 
establishing new dealers in a market can take considerable time and resources 
a portion of our distribution network is company owned because of the need for us to make financial investments in dealerships in order to preserve our market share and profitability in the affected regions 
in certain international markets  we have adopted a direct model of distribution through which we establish company owned sales and service capabilities 
if we are not able to effectively manage these businesses  they could have a negative effect on our operating results 
our direct sale and owned dealer models sell non steelcase products where product gaps exist 
these models involve increased operational risk  the risk of conflict with other distribution channels and the risk we will not be able to compete effectively to win business in those markets because of a more limited breadth of product offering than a dealer who carries multiple lines of products 
we could be adversely affected by product defects 
product defects can occur within our own product development and manufacturing processes or through our increasing reliance on third parties for product development and manufacturing activities 
our migration to a less vertically integrated manufacturing model has increased our reliance on a global network of suppliers  which subjects us to higher levels of risk associated with maintaining acceptable quality levels 
we incur various expenses related to product defects  including product warranty costs  product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs 
the amount of our product defect expenses relative to product sales varies from time to time and could increase in the future 
we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions  but our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve  resulting in a need to increase our accruals for warranty charges 
in addition  the reputation of our brands may be diminished by product defects and recalls 
we purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions 
any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents there may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
we have significant deferred tax asset values related to net operating loss carryforwards nols primarily in various non us jurisdictions 
we may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the applicable jurisdiction or implement tax  business or other planning strategies to fully utilize our nols 
we have nols in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk  which could reduce the amount we will ultimately realize 
additionally  future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our nols 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we have operations at locations throughout the us and around the world 
none of our owned properties are mortgaged or are held subject to any significant encumbrance 
we believe our facilities are in good operating condition and  at present  are in excess of that needed to meet volume needs currently and for the foreseeable future

table of contents liquidity facilities our total liquidity facilities as of february  were liquidity facilities amount global committed bank facility various uncommitted lines total credit lines available less borrowings outstanding standby letters of credit available capacity subject to covenant constraints the global committed bank facility has a five year term and matures in july we have the option of increasing the facility from to  subject to customary conditions 
borrowings under this facility are unsecured and unsubordinated 
there are currently no borrowings outstanding under this facility  however  there is an standby letter of credit issued in q in support of self insured workers compensation reserves that reduced our available credit line 
the facility requires us to satisfy two financial covenants a maximum leverage ratio covenant  which is measured by the ratio of debt to trailing four quarter ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and is required to be less than  and a minimum interest coverage ratio  which is measured by the ratio of trailing four quarter ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to trailing four quarter interest expense and is required to be greater than as of february   we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility and our other financing facilities  and they are fully available for our use  although the various uncommitted lines may be changed or cancelled by the banks at any time 
we anticipate our borrowing capacity under the unsecured credit facility could be reduced if our trailing four quarter ebitda levels continue to decline due to the deterioration in the global market conditions 
however  we do not currently anticipate needing to access the revolver in the near term 
in addition  we reviewed the current financial stability of the lenders participating in our global committed bank facility in light of the recent distress in the financial market and believe they have the ability to fulfill all existing commitments 
outstanding borrowings on uncommitted facilities of as of february  are primarily related to short term liquidity management within our international segment

the deterioration in the global economy and recent related decline in global equity markets has adversely impacted our revenue and operating profitability  particularly in north america

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in q  we also announced the implementation of a five percent reduction in base salaries for our north american salaried workforce and larger reductions for certain levels of management and executive officers 
similarly  the board of directors has voluntarily reduced their annual fees 
in addition  for we suspended our k matching contributions and we expect to reduce our minimum annual contributions to the retirement plan to between and of eligible compensation 
these actions are projected to remain in effect for approximately one year or until economic conditions improve 
we estimate these actions will reduce annualized pre tax operating expenses by approximately to during the time they remain effective 
in q and q  our board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of per share  compared to quarterly dividends of per share paid each quarter in and q through q beginning in q  we reduced the level of share repurchases compared to prior quarters

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting estimates that typically involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are listed and explained below 
these estimates were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and affect all segments of the company 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or earlier if conditions indicate it necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets using seven reporting units where goodwill is recorded specifically  north america excluding consolidated dealers and north america consolidated dealers within the north america segment  international  and coalesse  designtex  polyvision and ideo within the other category 
annually  we perform an impairment analysis on our intangible assets not subject to amortization using an income approach based on the cash flows attributable to the related products 
we also perform an annual impairment analysis for our intangible assets subject to amortization and our other long lived assets including property  plant and equipment 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in testing for 
table of contents impairment  we first determine if the asset is recoverable and then compare the discounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
as of february   we had of goodwill and of net intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as follows other intangible reportable segment goodwill assets  net north america international other category total during q  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units 
in the first step to test for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation dcf method and reconciled the fair value of our reporting units to the sum of our total market capitalization plus a control premium as of february  our adjusted market capitalization 
the control premium was based on the discounted cash flows associated with obtaining control of the company in an acquisition of the outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock 
the dcf analysis used the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows in measuring fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment valuations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with our current internal projections 
during the second half of  there was a substantial decline in the market price of our class a common stock and thus our market capitalization 
as part of our annual goodwill impairment test  we prepared a reconciliation of the fair value of our reporting units to our adjusted market capitalization as of february  as part of the reconciliation to our adjusted market capitalization  we made adjustments to the estimated future cash flows  as well as the discount rates used in calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
the discount rates ranged from to 
due to the subjective nature of this reconciliation process  these assumptions could change over time  which may result in future impairment charges 
as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined by each method described above is in excess of the underlying reported value of the goodwill as follows enterprise value available in excess reportable segment of goodwill north america international other category within the other category  polyvision s dcf analysis indicated a shortfall in enterprise value available for goodwill 
as the available enterprise value for polyvision was less than reported goodwill and intangible assets  respectively  in the first step of our impairment testing  we were required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
as a result of our step two analysis  we recorded total impairment charges of  of which related to goodwill and related to intangible assets 
these charges were primarily due to the impact of the substantial decline in our stock price and related market capitalization 
as of february   polyvision had remaining goodwill and intangible assets of and  respectively 
for each reporting unit other than polyvision  the excess enterprise value available for goodwill is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate by  leaving all 
table of contents other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the enterprise value in excess of goodwill to the following amounts enterprise value available in excess reportable segment of goodwill north america international other category based on the sensitivity analysis above  the coalesse reporting unit would have had goodwill balances in excess of enterprise value available for goodwill  and would have triggered the second step of our impairment testing 
this reporting unit had recorded goodwill aggregating as of february  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed quarterly and balances are adjusted as new information becomes available 
during  the us internal revenue service closed its examination of our tax returns for through and two state audits covering various years were also closed 
in connection with the closure of these audits  we paid tax deficiencies and adjusted reserves for uncertain tax positions resulting in a tax benefit in we are audited by the us internal revenue service under the compliance assurance process cap 
under cap  the u 
s internal revenue service works with large business taxpayers to identify and resolve issues prior to the filing of a tax return 
accordingly  we expect to record minimal liabilities for us federal uncertain tax positions in future years 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
future tax benefits of tax losses and credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we estimated a tax benefit from the operating loss carryforwards before valuation allowances of  but we recorded a valuation allowance of  which reduced our estimated tax benefit to additionally  we estimated a tax benefit from tax credit carryforwards of it is considered more likely than not that a combined benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
a decrease in the expected amount of benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would result in a decrease in net income of approximately pension and other post retirement benefits the company sponsors a number of domestic and foreign plans to provide pension  medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees 

table of contents the post retirement medical and life insurance plans are unfunded  but we purchased coli policies with the intention of utilizing them as a long term funding source for benefit obligations 
the asset values of the coli policies are not segregated in a trust specifically for the plans  thus are not considered plan assets 
changes in the values of these policies have no effect on the post retirement benefits expense or benefit obligations recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
a significant portion of our defined benefit pension obligations relates to our non qualified supplemental retirement plans that are limited to a select group of management approved by the compensation committee 
these plans are unfunded  but we purchased coli policies with the intention of utilizing them as a long term funding source for benefit obligations 
the asset values of the coli policies are not segregated in a trust specifically for the plans  thus are not considered plan assets 
changes in the values of these policies have no effect on the defined benefit pension expense or benefit obligations recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans for the measurement and recognition of obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans 
embodied in both of these standards is the concept that the cost of benefits provided during retirement should be recognized over the employees active working lives 
inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date 
key actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include  among others  the discount rate and health cost trend rates 
these assumptions are reviewed with our actuaries and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including but not limited to  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 
to conduct our annual review of discount rates  we perform a matching exercise of projected plan cash flows against spot rates on a yield curve comprised of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date  with a primary focus for our domestic plans on the ryan alm curve in and an average of the citigroup regular curve and citigroup above median curve in the measurement dates for our retiree benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end 
accordingly  we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during february of each year 
based on consolidated obligations as of february   a one percentage point decline in the weighted average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would change the benefits expense by less than all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 
to conduct our annual review of healthcare cost trend rates  we model our actual claims cost data over a historical period  including an analysis of pre versus post age groups and other important demographic components of our covered retiree population 
this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends 
our initial healthcare cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short term future trends 
as of february   our initial rate of for pre age retirees and for post age retirees was trended downward by each year  until the ultimate trend rate of is reached 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate healthcare cost premium 
based on consolidated obligations as of february   a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would change the benefits expense by less 
table of contents than all experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method  resulting in at least the minimum amortization prescribed by sfas no 
despite the previously described policies for selecting key actuarial assumptions  we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience 
as of february   we had consolidated unamortized prior service credits and net experience gains of  as compared to as of february  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on employee benefit obligations 
forward looking statements from time to time  in written and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding future events and our plans and objectives for future operations 
these forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  possible  potential  predict  project  or other similar words  phrases or expressions 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary from our expectations because of factors such as  but not limited to  competitive and general economic conditions domestically and internationally  acts of terrorism  war  governmental action  natural disasters and other force majeure events  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  our restructuring activities  currency fluctuations  changes in customer demand  and the other risks and contingencies detailed in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we undertake no obligation to update  amend or clarify forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and fixed income and equity price risk 
foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe and canada represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and in we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for related to the euro and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that an additional devaluation of the us dollar against the local currencies would have increased our operating income by approximately in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 

table of contents the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  we could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if we were to exit the market and liquidate our net investment 
as of february   the cumulative net currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
for  net transaction losses were see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our cash and cash equivalents  investments  notes receivable and short term borrowings 
substantially all of our interest rates on our long term borrowings were fixed during  thus our interest rate risk was minimized on our debt 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are primarily invested in short dated instruments 
however  as of february   we held and canadian par value investments in ars and canadian abcp  respectively  for which no liquid markets currently exist 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we estimate a percentage point change in interest rates would have less than a impact to our results of operations for fixed income and equity price risk we are exposed to fixed income and equity price risk primarily on the cash surrender value associated with our investments in coli 
we estimate a adverse change in the value of the underlying funds  which could be caused by changes in interest rates  yield curve  portfolio duration or equity prices  would have reduced our operating income by approximately and in and  respectively 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  the investment managers actively manage certain fixed income and equity investments and their results could be better or worse than the market returns
