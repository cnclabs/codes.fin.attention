please see the cautionary note regarding forward looking information and risk factors herein for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand terrestar corporation  formerly motient corporation 
it is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements contained in this annual report 
business overview terrestar corporation formerly motient corporation was incorporated in under the laws of the state of delaware 
terrestar corporation is in the integrated satellite wireless communications business through its ownership of terrestar networks  its principal operating entity  and terrestar global 
terrestar corporation  through terrestar networks and in cooperation with its canadian partner  canada  is enabling our partners and their customers to offer a reliable and secure satellite terrestrial mobile broadband network that will provide mobile voice  data and video services to homeland defense and public safety organizations  rural and under served communities  outdoor adventurers  maritime industry  mm machine to machine communications providers  and to power users interested in anywhere coverage throughout north america 
we continue to make significant progress with our technology partners in the construction of terrestar  our ghz mobile satellite service mss satellite  and the development of the reference design and form factor of our integrated satellite terrestrial handset 
while the satellite has experienced certain delays  we are on track to launch terrestar in the second quarter of and expect to be commercially ready in late to provide a wholesale communications backbone that will permit users and devices to seamlessly and securely access voice  data and mobile video applications through integrated satellite and terrestrial platforms 
we are currently exploring many different channels and partners that will help us create value using the capacity of our network as quickly as possible 
terrestar networks  in cooperation with its canadian partner  canada and company  limited partnership canada  formerly tmi communications and company  limited partnership tmi communications  plans to launch an innovative wireless communications system to provide mobile coverage throughout the united states and canada using small  lightweight and inexpensive handsets similar to today s mobile devices 
this system build out will be based on an integrated satellite and ground based technology which will provide service in most hard to reach areas and will provide a nationwide interoperable  survivable and critical communications infrastructure 
as of december   we have four wholly owned subsidiaries  mvh holdings inc  motient holdings inc  cctv wireless i  llc  and port merger corporation 
mvh holdings inc and motient ventures holdings inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of mvh holdings inc  directly hold approximately and interests in terrestar networks and terrestar global  respectively 
based on our current business plan  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity required to conduct operations through december  and into the first quarter of we will likely face a cash deficit in the first quarter of unless it obtains additional capital 
we cannot guarantee that financing sources will be available or available on favorable terms 

table of contents overview terrestar networks inc terrestar networks is our principal operating entity 
in cooperation with its canadian partner  canada  formerly tmi communications and company  limited partnership  we plan to launch an innovative wireless communications system to provide mobile coverage throughout the us and canada using small  lightweight and inexpensive handsets similar to today s mobile devices 
this system build out will be based on an integrated satellite and ground based technology which will provide service in most hard to reach areas and will provide a nationwide interoperable  survivable and critical communications infrastructure 
by offering mss using frequencies in the ghz band  which are part of what is often known as the s band  in conjunction with atc  we can effectively deploy an integrated satellite and terrestrial wireless communications network 
our network would allow a user to utilize a mobile device that would communicate with a traditional land based wireless network when in range of that network  but communicate with a satellite when not in range of such a land based network 
we intend to provide multiple communications applications  including voice  data and video services 
terrestar networks is in the process of building its first satellite pursuant to a construction contract with loral 
once launched  our terrestar satellite  with an antenna approximately sixty feet across  will be able to communicate with conventionally sized wireless devices currently being developed by our vendors 
our ability to offer these services depends on terrestar networks right to receive certain regulatory authorizations allowing it to provide mss atc in the s band 
these authorizations are subject to various regulatory milestones relating to the construction  launch and operational date of the satellite system required to provide this service 
we may be required to obtain additional approvals from national and local authorities in connection with the services that we wish to provide in the future 
for example  in order to provide atc in the united states and canada we must file additional applications separately from our satellite authorizations 
in addition  the manufacturers of our atc user terminals and base stations will need to obtain fcc equipment certifications and similar certifications in canada 
terrestar networks was initially created as a subsidiary of skyterra  formerly known as msv  established to  among other things  develop a satellite communications system using the s band 
on may   we acquired our ownership interest in terrestar networks when  in conjunction with a spin off of terrestar networks to the owners of msv  we purchased an additional million of newly issued terrestar networks common stock 
in conjunction with this transaction  terrestar networks also entered into an agreement with msv s wholly owned subsidiary  atc technologies  llc atc technologies pursuant to which terrestar networks has a perpetual  royalty free license to utilize atc technologies patent portfolio in the s band  including those patents related to atc  which we anticipate will allow us to deploy a communications network that seamlessly integrates satellite and terrestrial communications  giving a user ubiquitous wireless coverage in the us and canada 
since may   we have consolidated terrestar networks financial results in our financial statements 
we have the right to use two mhz blocks of contiguous and unshared mss s band spectrum covering a population of over million throughout the united states and canada 
our entire spectrum is eligible for atc status 
atc authorization provides the ability to integrate terrestrial mobile services with mss 
we anticipate using this atc authorization to create a two way wireless communications network providing coverage  services and applications to mobile and portable wireless users 
our planned network is designed to allow an end user to seamlessly communicate with a terrestrial wireless network or our satellite through a conventional mobile device  optimizing service quality  continuity and geographic coverage 
in the second quarter of  we plan to launch our first multi spot beam geostationary satellite  terrestar  which is designed so that the beams can be refocused dynamically 
we are also working with vendors to develop our next generation network 

table of contents we believe our network s satellite and terrestrial mobile capabilities will serve the needs of various users  such as us and canadian government and emergency first responder personnel who require reliable  uninterrupted and interoperable connectivity that can be provided by an integrated satellite and terrestrial network 
in october  we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement crada with the us defense information system agency disa to jointly develop a north american emergency response communications network 
we expect the crada to result in the development of products that will mutually benefit us and the us government 
we also believe that our planned network will appeal to a broad base of potential end users  customers and strategic partners  including those in the media  technology and communications sectors  logistics and distribution sectors and other sectors requiring uninterrupted wireless service 
our relationship with terrestar canada and canada msv formed terrestar networks in as a wholly owned subsidiary and subsequently spun terrestar networks off to msv s owners  which included tmi communications now known as canada and terrestar corporation or entities controlled by each 
as part of the spin off of terrestar networks  tmi communications became contractually obligated to assign  subject to necessary regulatory approvals  its industry canada approval in principle to terrestar networks  or to an entity designated by terrestar networks that is eligible under canadian law to hold the approval in principle 
terrestar networks negotiated and committed  pursuant to a master agreement  to enter into the transfer agreements with tmi communications tmi communications outstanding obligations under the transfer agreements were assumed by canada on december  as the transferee of tmi communications interest in terrestar canada holdings  terrestar canada  terrestar canada holdings and certain other related parties the transfer agreements pursuant to which terrestar networks will transfer terrestar to terrestar canada and tmi communications effectuated the transfer of its industry canada approval in principle to terrestar canada and fcc authorization to terrestar networks 
tmi communications assignment of its industry canada approval to terrestar canada was authorized by industry canada on april  this authorization transferred the necessary approvals for terrestar canada to launch and operate a satellite at the degrees west longitude orbital position in order to provide mss in canada 
on october   industry canada clarified that the authorization as transferred included the authority to operate at degrees west longitude 
in order to comply with canada s telecommunications foreign ownership rules  title to terrestar is expected to be transferred to terrestar canada at the time that title would have otherwise transferred to terrestar networks under the terms of its satellite construction contract with loral  as amended 
the transfer agreements also provide for  among other things  the license of certain intellectual property rights to terrestar canada  the grant to terrestar networks of an indefeasible right to use capacity on terrestar  and the provision by terrestar networks to terrestar canada of various consulting and other services 
terrestar networks owns of the voting equity of terrestar canada as well as of the voting equity of terrestar canada holdings  terrestar canada s parent company 
the remaining of the voting equity of terrestar canada is held by terrestar canada holdings and the remaining of the voting equity of terrestar canada holdings is held by canada 
terrestar networks interests in terrestar canada and terrestar canada holdings reflect the maximum ownership levels currently permitted by applicable canadian telecommunications foreign ownership rules 
upon the receipt of approval from industry canada to transfer the industry canada approval in principle from tmi communications to terrestar canada on april   terrestar networks entered into a shareholders agreement  or the terrestar canada shareholders agreement  a rights and services agreement  or the rights and services agreement  a guarantee and share pledge agreement  or the tmi guarantee and certain other transfer agreements  terrestar canada executed a guarantee in favor of terrestar networks  referred to as the terrestar canada guarantee  and terrestar networks and certain other parties entered into certain other transfer agreements 
set out below is a description of certain of the transfer agreements 

table of contents effective december   bce completed a restructuring which resulted in tmi communications  a wholly owned subsidiary of bce  transferring all of its shares of terrestar canada holdings to canada 
canada is also a wholly owned subsidiary of bce 
in connection with the restructuring  tmi communications entered into an agreement to be bound and release dated december  pursuant to which tmi communications agreed to transfer to canada its interest in terrestar canada holdings and canada agreed to become bound by the terms and conditions of the terrestar canada shareholders agreement 
further  pursuant to the agreement to be bound and release  each of the parties to the terrestar canada shareholders agreement released and discharged tmi communications from its obligations under the terrestar canada shareholders agreement 
tmi communications also entered into a joinder agreement dated december  with canada  terrestar networks  terrestar canada and terrestar corporation  pursuant to which canada agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the transfer agreements to which tmi communications was a party including  but not limited to  the tmi guarantee  and the parties thereto agreed to release and discharge tmi communications from its obligations under such transfer agreements 
on january   terrestar networks entered into a master agreement the agreement with trio general partnership trio and certain other parties  pursuant to which  subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions  including the receipt of necessary governmental approvals from industry canada and obtaining certain third party consents  trio through a wholly owned subsidiary will purchase the voting equity stake in terrestar canada holdings currently held by canada 
trio and terrestar networks will enter into a series of agreements that will be materially similar to the transfer agreements 
terrestar networks will retain its existing voting equity ownership of terrestar canada holdings 
trio is majority owned by certain managing partners of trio capital inc  a canadian investment firm  including jacques leduc 
mr 
leduc is also a member of the board of directors and a member of the nominating committee 
terrestar global limited terrestar global was initially formed in as a wholly owned subsidiary of terrestar networks 
we have consolidated the financial results of terrestar global since its inception 
in late  terrestar networks spun off terrestar global to its stockholders 
as a result  terrestar corporation became the indirect majority holder of terrestar global 
in connection with the spin off  terrestar networks made capital contributions to terrestar global of million 
in late  terrestar global also raised an additional million through a rights offering from its shareholders  in proportion to their holdings  the majority of which came from terrestar corporation 
as of december   terrestar corporation owned approximately of the outstanding shares of terrestar global 
through a wholly owned subsidiary of terrestar global  terrestar europe  our goal is to build  own and operate a pan european integrated mobile satellite and terrestrial communications network to address public safety and disaster relief as well as provide broadband connectivity in rural regions to help narrow the digital divide 
as europe s first next generation integrated mobile satellite and terrestrial communication network  terrestar global plans to deliver universal access and tailored applications over a fully optimized ip network 
on october   terrestar europe filed an application with the european commission for a pan european ghz mss s band spectrum authorization 
terrestar europe has entered into a number of contracts in connection with its application  including contracts for the construction and operation of a satellite and earth station 
we expect that the european commission will issue such authorizations in there can be no assurance that terrestar europe will be awarded an authorization 

table of contents current year s developments the terrestar satellite main body has successfully completed its thermal vacuum testing and high power and passive intermodulation testing of the flight model feed array for its ghz mobile s band satellite service satellite 
terrestar is now in the final demonstration phase  followed by final assembly and performance testing 
in june  the terrestar s band reflector sustained damage during manufacturing at harris corporation  the reflector sub contractor used by loral 
the harris corporation has provided a commitment to complete and ship the reflector to loral for integration on the terrestar satellite by march  based on this commitment  loral informed us that terrestar will be ready to ship to the launch provider  arianespace  in april as a result  launch of terrestar has been postponed from fourth quarter to second quarter arianespace has confirmed a new launch slot of june  to june  we have sought approval from the federal communications commission fcc to extend its remaining milestones 
there can be no assurance that such request will be granted 
industry canada has granted approval of an extension of its remaining milestone

on june   we issued million shares of our series e junior participating preferred stock to harbinger  convertible into million shares of our common stock for the effective purchase of cctv wireless  llc  the holder of certain ghz licenses 
the transaction was consummated on june  our series e preferred stock does not currently trade on the public market  therefore  we measured the costs of the ghz licenses acquired from harbinger based on the fair value of the underlying common shares 
the echostar investment agreement  harbinger investment agreement  shareholder investment agreements  echostar agreement and the harbinger contribution agreement contain representations  warranties  covenants and indemnities by terrestar corporation and terrestar networks customary for transactions of this nature 
terrestar corporation  terrestar networks  echostar  harbinger and the certain existing investors entered into a registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement  dated february   containing customary terms and conditions providing for the registration of common stock to be issued in these transactions 
aggregate gross proceeds to terrestar networks from these transactions were approximately million in cash  of which approximately million was made available at closing and the balance of which will be dedicated to funding the terrestar satellite under the credit agreement defined below 
in addition to shareholder approval  the spectrum transactions were subject to certain government approvals 
as a result of these transactions  the boards of directors of both terrestar corporation and terrestar networks were expanded to eight members and  depending on stock holdings  echostar and harbinger each have the right to nominate up to two members of each board 
on february   we entered into a million purchase money credit agreement the credit agreement  among terrestar networks  as the borrower  the guarantors party thereto from time to time  us bank national association  as collateral agent  and harbinger and echostar  as lenders 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate of per annum

the series c and d preferred stock rank junior to the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock  on a parity basis with one another and senior to both our junior preferred and our common shares 
the series c and d preferred stock are non transferable 

table of contents we held approximately million shares of non voting common stock of skyterra communications as of december  this was accounted for under the cost method and valued at approximately million 
we also had a corresponding contractual commitment with skyterra to distribute million of these shares to our shareholders  and had recorded a dividend liability of million as of december  using the same adjusted cost basis as our investment 
on february   terrestar corporation  mvh holdings inc and harbinger capital partners fund i  lp entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which terrestar corporation sold million shares of non voting common stock of skyterra to harbinger capital partners fund i  lp for an aggregate sale price of million 
terrestar corporation received the proceeds on february  we recognized a loss on this sale of million for the three months ended march  on september   we sold our remaining million shares of skyterra for gross proceeds of million 
we recognized a loss of approximately million on this transaction 
harbinger purchased approximately million shares and the remaining shares were sold to other purchasers 
a portion of the shares sold to harbinger were delivered to an escrow agent pending receipt of fcc approval of harbinger s pending application to control up to of skyterra 
in order to permit terrestar corporation to sell these skyterra shares  skyterra agreed to waive a contractual requirement for terrestar to distribute million of the skyterra shares to terrestar corporation s shareholders 
consequently  we eliminated the million dividend liability 
we recorded a benefit to decrease dividend liability of million due to change in value of the shares  as a corresponding offset to the loss on the sale of the skyterra shares  and the remaining million was recorded to additional paid in capital as an offset to the originally recorded transaction 
terrestar corporation also granted to skyterra the right to sell to third parties the  shares  or approximately of the total outstanding common shares  of terrestar networks held by skyterra 
subject to certain conditions  purchasers of these shares would have the right to exchange them to terrestar corporation for shares of terrestar corporation common stock per terrestar networks share  and would have registration rights with respect to these terrestar corporation shares 
terrestar corporation would also receive  shares of terrestar global  another terrestar corporation subsidiary  currently owned by skyterra in conjuction with this exchange 
if consummated  this exchange would result in terrestar corporation owning more than of terrestar networks and terrestar global 
other agreements and contracts on august   we announced that terrestar networks had entered into a nationwide reciprocal roaming agreement with at t mobility llc 
on december   terrestar networks entered into a fifteen year agreement agreement with qualcomm incorporated qualcomm for the provision by qualcomm of satellite enabled mobile chipsets and satellite base station components to facilitate the development of s band mobile devices and network systems 
a broad range of qualcomm chipsets  to be available on a mass market basis  will include satellite and s band capabilities 
the agreement also contemplates that other operators operator may enter into similar arrangements with qualcomm 
the termination by one operator of its agreement with qualcomm does not affect the agreement of any other operator 
terrestar networks has been advised that ico satellite services gp ico and msv have entered into similar agreements with qualcomm 
each operator will fund a portion of the related non recurring engineering nre expenses incurred in connection with the agreements  which will result in a further sharing of nre if and when additional operators enter into similar agreements with qualcomm 
the terrestar networks portion of the nre to be paid to qualcomm is expected to be in an amount not to exceed six million dollars  which amount will be reduced if other operators enter into similar agreements with qualcomm 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our most significant estimates relating to our continuing operations include the valuation of stock based compensation  deferred tax assets and long lived assets 
valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets a significant portion of our total assets are long lived assets primarily consisting of property and equipment and intangible assets 
property and equipment  or p e  consists of network  lab  office and computer equipment  internal use software and leasehold improvements 
intangible assets consists of indefinite ghz spectrum and definite lived intangible assets related to radio spectrum and other intellectual property that were obtained in connection with several exchange transactions of our common stock for terrestar networks common stock with shareholders pursuant to an exchange agreement entered into in as of december   property and equipment and intangibles represented million and million  respectively  of our total assets of billion 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on long lived assets using the straight line method based on the estimated economic useful lives as follows long lived assets estimated useful life network  lab and office equipment years computers  software and equipment years leasehold improvements lesser of lease term or estimated useful life definite lived intangible assets years satellite and terrestrial network assets under construction years after launch we evaluate whether long lived assets have been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
for such long lived assets  impairment exists when its carrying value exceeds the sum of estimates of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration  a probability weighted approach is used for developing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the impairment is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  such that the asset s carrying value is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
we included in our evaluation a sensitivity analysis that would address market volatility factors and credit constraints 
we evaluated our business plans and their related undiscounted cash flows and determined a probability weighting for them 
as a result of our analysis  we determined that the long lived assets as of december  were not impaired

our principal liquidity needs are to meet our working capital requirements  operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations 
based on our current business plan  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity required to conduct operations through december  and into the first quarter of we will likely face a cash deficit in the first quarter of unless we obtain additional capital 
we cannot guarantee that financing sources will be available or available on favorable terms 
our principal sources of liquidity consist of our existing cash on hand and our secured million credit agreement  of which million is available 
as of december   including restricted cash  we had million of cash on hand 
after giving effect to the net proceeds available under the credit agreement  we have approximately million of liquidity resources available to fund operations 
our short term liquidity needs are driven by our satellite system construction contracts  the development of terrestrial infrastructure and networks  the design and development of our handset and chipset  and our ongoing operating expenses 
as of december   we had contractual obligations of million due within one year  consisting of approximately million related to our satellite system  of which  we expect to spend between and million to obtain satellite launch insurance prior to the launch of our terrestar satellite  million related to our handset  chipset  and terrestrial network  and million for operating leases 
in addition  terrestar europe  a terrestar global subsidiary  recently filed an application for the award of s band spectrum in europe 
if we are awarded this spectrum  we will need additional funds in terrestar global for satellite construction and terrestrial ground network development 
we have the ability to preserve cash by deferring certain operating and capital expenditures related to the deployment of our satellite and terrestrial network into future periods 
our long term liquidity needs are to fund the deployment and expansion of our terrestrial infrastructure and networks  the design of our second generation handset and chipset  orbital incentive payments related to our satellite contracts  and settlement of our series a and b cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock which mature on april   if not converted 
in addition  we will need funds for working capital purposes  which we anticipate will grow as our operations expand 
as of december   we had aggregate contractual payment obligations of approximately million  consisting of approximately million for the terrestar networks satellites and incentive payments  approximately million for our operating leases in reston  virginia  lincolnshire  illinois and richardson park  texas  data centers  and site hosting agreements  and approximately million for obligations related to the build out of our terrestrial network and handset and chipset costs 
however  we have identified in excess of million of these contractual obligations that can be eliminated or deferred 
we intend to fund our long term liquidity needs related to operations and ongoing network deployment through the incurrence of indebtedness  equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity 
although we believe that these sources will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our future liquidity and capital obligations  our ability to fund these needs will depend on our future performance  which will be subject in part to general economic  financial  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control  including trends in our industry and technology developments 
however  we may not be able to obtain this additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all
