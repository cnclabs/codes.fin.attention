business and overview we are a global provider of hospitality products and services and operate our business in the following three segments lodging franchises hotels in the upscale  midscale  economy and extended stay segments of the lodging industry and provides property management services to owners of our luxury  upscale and midscale hotels 
vacation exchange and rentals provides vacation exchange products and services to owners of intervals of vacation ownership interests vois and markets vacation rental properties primarily on behalf of independent owners 
vacation ownership develops  markets and sells vois to individual consumers  provides consumer financing in connection with the sale of vois and provides property management services at resorts 
the general health of the hospitality industry is affected by the performance of the us economy 
in  the us economy experienced real gdp growth of approximately 
in  us real gdp is expected to decline by approximately 
during  total travel expenditures in the united states were projected to be an estimated billion  which represents an increase of approximately from for  total travel expenditures by domestic and international travelers in the united states are projected to be an estimated billion  which represents a decrease of approximately from projected expenditures during separation from cendant on july   cendant corporation or former parent distributed all of the shares of wyndham common stock to the holders of cendant common stock issued and outstanding on july   the record date for the distribution 
on august   we commenced regular way trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol wyn 
before our separation from cendant  we entered into separation  transition services and several other agreements with cendant  realogy and travelport to effect the separation and distribution  govern the relationships among the parties after the separation and allocate among the parties cendant s assets  liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation 
under the separation and distribution agreement  we assumed of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of cendant or its subsidiaries which were not primarily related to our business or the businesses of realogy  travelport or avis budget  and realogy assumed of these contingent and other corporate liabilities 
these include liabilities relating to cendant s terminated or divested businesses  the travelport sale on august   taxes of travelport for taxable periods through the date of the travelport sale  certain litigation matters  generally any actions relating to the separation plan and payments under certain contracts that were not allocated to any specific party in connection with the separation 
on december   realogy entered into an agreement and plan of merger with an affiliate of apollo management vi  lp apollo and  on april   realogy announced that affiliates of apollo had completed the merger 
although realogy no longer trades as a public company  the merger does not negate realogy s obligation to satisfy of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of cendant or its subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of the separation agreement 
as a result of the sale  realogy s senior debt credit rating was downgraded to below investment grade 
under the separation agreement  if realogy experienced such a change of 
table of contents control and suffered such a ratings downgrade  it was required to post a letter of credit in an amount acceptable to us and avis budget group to satisfy the fair value of realogy s indemnification obligations for the cendant legacy contingent liabilities in the event realogy does not otherwise satisfy such obligations to the extent they become due 
on april   realogy posted a million irrevocable standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank in favor of avis budget group and upon which demand may be made if realogy does not otherwise satisfy its obligations for its share of the cendant legacy contingent liabilities 
the letter of credit can be adjusted from time to time based upon the outstanding contingent liabilities and has an expiration of september  subject to renewal and certain provisions 
the issuance of this letter of credit does not relieve or limit realogy s obligations for these liabilities 
because we now conduct our business as a separate stand alone public company  our historical financial information does not reflect what our results of operations  financial position or cash flows would have been had we been a separate stand alone public company during the periods presented 
therefore  the historical financial information for such periods may not necessarily be indicative of what our results of operations  financial position or cash flows will be in the future and may not be comparable to periods ending after july  results of operations lodging we enter into agreements to franchise our lodging franchise systems to independent hotel owners 
our standard franchise agreement typically has a term of to years and provides a franchisee with certain rights to terminate the franchise agreement before the term of the agreement under certain circumstances 
the principal source of revenues from franchising hotels is ongoing franchise fees  which are comprised of royalty fees and other fees relating to marketing and reservation services 
ongoing franchise fees typically are based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchised hotel and are accrued as earned and upon becoming due from the franchisee 
an estimate of uncollectible ongoing franchise fees is charged to bad debt expense and included in operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
lodging revenues also include initial franchise fees  which are recognized as revenue when all material services or conditions have been substantially performed  which is either when a franchised hotel opens for business or when a franchise agreement is terminated as it has been determined that the franchised hotel will not open 
our franchise agreements also require the payment of fees for certain services  including marketing and reservations 
with such fees  we provide our franchised properties with a suite of operational and administrative services  including access to i an international  centralized  brand specific reservations system  ii advertising  iii promotional and co marketing programs  iv referrals  v technology  vi training and vii volume purchasing 
we are contractually obligated to expend the marketing and reservation fees we collect from franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements  as such  revenues earned in excess of costs incurred are accrued as a liability for future marketing or reservation costs 
costs incurred in excess of revenues are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with our franchise agreements  we include an allocation of costs required to carry out marketing and reservation activities within marketing and reservation expenses 
we also provide property management services for hotels under management contracts 
our standard management agreement typically has a term of up to years 
our management fees are comprised of base fees  which are typically calculated based upon a specified percentage of gross revenues from hotel operations  and incentive fees  which are typically calculated based upon a specified percentage of a hotel s gross operating profit 
management fee revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract 
we incur certain reimbursable costs on behalf of managed hotel properties and reports reimbursements received from managed properties as revenue and the costs incurred on their behalf as expenses 
management fee revenues are recorded as a component of franchise fee revenues and reimbursable revenues are recorded as a component of service fees and membership revenue on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
the costs  which principally relate to payroll costs for operational employees who work at the managed hotels  are reflected as a component of operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
the reimbursements from hotel owners are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  as a result  these reimbursable costs have little to no effect on our operating income 
management fee revenue and revenue related to payroll reimbursements were million and million  respectively  during  million and million  respectively  during and million and million  respectively  during we also earn revenue from administering the wyndham rewards loyalty program 
we charge our franchisee managed property owner a fee based upon a percentage of room revenue generated from member stays at participating hotels 
this fee is accrued as earned and upon becoming due from the franchisee 
within our lodging segment  we measure operating performance using the following key operating statistics i number of rooms  which represents the number of rooms at lodging properties at the end of the year  ii revpar  
table of contents which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of available rooms occupied for the year by the average rate charged for renting a lodging room for one day and iii royalty  marketing and reservation revenues  which are typically based on a percentage of the gross room revenues of each franchised hotel 
vacation exchange and rentals as a provider of vacation exchange services  we enter into affiliation agreements with developers of vacation ownership properties to allow owners of intervals to trade their intervals for certain other intervals within our vacation exchange business and  for some members  for other leisure related products and services 
additionally  as a marketer of vacation rental properties  generally we enter into contracts for exclusive periods of time with property owners to market the rental of such properties to rental customers 
our vacation exchange business derives a majority of its revenues from annual membership dues and exchange fees from members trading their intervals 
annual dues revenue represents the annual membership fees from members who participate in our vacation exchange business and  for additional fees  have the right to exchange their intervals for certain other intervals within our vacation exchange business and  for certain members  for other leisure related products and services 
we record revenue from annual membership dues as deferred income on the consolidated balance sheets and recognize it on a straight line basis over the membership period during which delivery of publications  if applicable  and other services are provided to the members 
exchange fees are generated when members exchange their intervals for equivalent values of rights and services  which may include intervals at other properties within our vacation exchange business or other leisure related products and services 
exchange fees are recognized as revenue  net of expected cancellations  when the exchange requests have been confirmed to the member 
our vacation rentals business primarily derives its revenues from fees  which generally average between and of the gross booking fees for non proprietary inventory  as compared to properties that we own or operate under long term capital leases where we receive of the revenue 
the majority of the time  we act on behalf of the owners of the rental properties to generate our fees 
we provide reservation services to the independent property owners and receive the agreed upon fee for the service provided 
we remit the gross rental fee received from the renter to the independent property owner  net of our agreed upon fee 
revenue from such fees is recognized in the period that the rental reservation is made  net of expected cancellations 
upon confirmation of the rental reservation  the rental customer and property owner generally have a direct relationship for additional services to be performed 
cancellations for  and each totaled less than of rental transactions booked 
our revenue is earned when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also earn rental fees in connection with properties we own or operate under long term capital leases and such fees are recognized when the rental customer s stay occurs  as this is the point at which the service is rendered 
within our vacation exchange and rentals segment  we measure operating performance using the following key operating statistics i average number of vacation exchange members  which represents members in our vacation exchange programs who pay annual membership dues and are entitled  for additional fees  to exchange their intervals for intervals at other properties affiliated within our vacation exchange business and  for certain members  for other leisure related products and services  ii annual membership dues and exchange revenue per member  which represents the total annual dues and exchange fees generated for the year divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the year  iii vacation rental transactions  which represents the number of transactions that are generated in connection with customers booking their vacation rental stays through us and iv average net price per vacation rental  which represents the net rental price generated from renting vacation properties to customers divided by the number of rental transactions 
vacation ownership we develop  market and sell vois to individual consumers  provide property management services at resorts and provide consumer financing in connection with the sale of vois 
our vacation ownership business derives the majority of its revenues from sales of vois and derives other revenues from consumer financing and property management 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues of voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in sfas no 
 accounting of sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for nondelivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues on voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is 
table of contents obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing agreements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenue and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
until a contract for sale qualifies for revenue recognition  all payments received are accounted for as restricted cash and deposits within other current assets and deferred income  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is recorded 
if a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale  non recoverable expenses are charged to operating expense in the current period on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
we also offer consumer financing as an option to customers purchasing vois  which are typically collateralized by the underlying voi 
generally  the financing terms are for ten years 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is recorded at the time of the sale with a charge to the provision for loan losses on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   the provision for loan losses is now classified as a reduction of vacation ownership interest sales on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
the interest income earned from the financing arrangements is earned on the principal balance outstanding over the life of the arrangement and is recorded within consumer financing on the consolidated and combined statement of operations 
we also provide day to day management services  including oversight of housekeeping services  maintenance and certain accounting and administrative services for property owners associations and clubs 
in some cases  our employees serve as officers and or directors of these associations and clubs in accordance with their by laws and associated regulations 
management fee revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract and is recorded as a component of service fees and membership on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
the costs  which principally relate to the payroll costs for management of the associations  clubs and the resort properties where we are the employer  are reflected as a component of operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
reimbursements are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin and thus presentation of these reimbursable costs has little to no effect on our operating income 
management fee revenue and revenue related to reimbursements was million and million  respectively  during  million and million  respectively  during and million and million  respectively  during during  and  one of the associations that we manage paid group rci million  million and million  respectively  for exchange services 
during  and  gross sales of vois were reduced by million  million and million  respectively  representing the net change in revenue that is deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  a portion of the total revenue from a vacation ownership contract sale is not recognized if the construction of the vacation resort has not yet been fully completed 
such revenue will be recognized in future periods in proportion to the costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs for completion of construction of the vacation resort 
within our vacation ownership segment  we measure operating performance using the following key metrics i gross voi sales including tele sales upgrades  which are a component of upgrade sales before deferred sales and loan loss provisions  ii tours  which represents the number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell vois and iii volume per guest  or vpg  which represents revenue per guest and is calculated by dividing the gross voi sales  excluding tele sales upgrades  which are a component of upgrade sales  by the number of tours 
other items we record lodging related marketing and reservation revenues  wyndham rewards revenues  as well as property management services revenues for both our lodging and vacation ownership segments  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues be recorded on a gross basis 

table of contents discussed below are our consolidated and combined results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which is defined as net income loss before depreciation and amortization  interest expense excluding interest on securitized vacation ownership debt  interest income  income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  each of which is presented on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
we believe that ebitda is a useful measure of performance for our industry segments which  when considered with gaap measures  gives a more complete understanding of our operating performance 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
for the period january  to july   cendant allocated million of general corporate overhead costs to us based on a percentage of our forecasted revenues 
general corporate expense allocations included costs related to cendant s executive management  tax  accounting  legal  treasury and cash management  certain employee benefits and real estate usage for common space 
the allocations were not necessarily indicative of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been operating as a separate  stand alone public company for the periods presented

such decreases were partially offset by i a million increase in consumer financing revenues earned on vacation ownership contract receivables due primarily to growth in the portfolio  ii a million increase in net revenues from rental transactions primarily due to an increase in the average net price per rental  including the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements  and the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  iii million of incremental property management fees within our vacation ownership business primarily as a result of growth in the number of units under management  and iv a million increase in net revenues in our lodging business due to higher international royalty  marketing and reservation revenues  incremental net revenues generated from the july acquisition of us franchise systems  inc and its microtel inns suites and hawthorn suites hotel brands usfs  increased revenue from our wyndham rewards loyalty program and incremental property management reimbursable revenues  partially offset by lower domestic royalty  marketing and reservation revenues 
the total net revenue increase at our vacation exchange and rentals business includes the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of million 
total expenses increased  million principally reflecting i a non cash charge of  million for the impairment of goodwill at our vacation ownership business as a result of organizational realignment plans see restructuring plan for more details announced during the fourth quarter of which reduced future cash flow estimates by lowering our expected voi sales pace in the future based on the expectation that access to the asset backed securities market will continue to be challenging  ii non cash charges of million across our three businesses to reduce the carrying value of certain assets based on their revised estimated fair values  iii the recognition of million of costs at our lodging  vacation exchange and rentals and vacation ownership businesses relating to organizational realignment initiatives  iv million of a lower net benefit related to the resolution of and adjustment to certain contingent liabilities and assets  v a million increase in operating and administrative expenses at our vacation exchange and rentals business primarily related to increased resort services expenses resulting from the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  increased volume related expenses due to growth  higher employee incentive program expenses and increased consulting costs  vi charges of million due to currency conversion losses related to the transfer of cash from our venezuelan operations at our vacation exchange and rentals business  vii a million increase in operating and administrative expenses at our lodging business primarily related to increased payroll costs paid on behalf of and for which we are reimbursed by the property owners  increased expenses related to ancillary services provided to franchisees and increased expenses resulting from the usfs acquisition  partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives and lower employee incentive program expenses  viii million of increased consumer financing interest expense  ix an million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily reflecting increased capital investments over the past two years  x the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on expenses at our vacation exchange and rentals business of million  and xi an million increase in operating and administrative expenses at our vacation ownership business primarily related to increased costs related to property management services  partially offset by lower employee related expenses 
these increases were partially offset by i million of decreased cost of sales at our vacation ownership business primarily due to increased estimated recoveries associated with the increase in our provision for loan losses  as discussed above  ii million of decreased costs at our vacation ownership business 
table of contents primarily related to sales incentives awarded to owners  lower maintenance fees on unsold inventory  the absence of costs associated with the repair of one of our completed voi resorts and the absence of a net charge related to a prior acquisition  iii million of increased deferred expenses related to the net increase in deferred revenue at our vacation ownership business  as discussed above  iv million of favorable hedging on foreign exchange contracts at our vacation exchange and rentals business  v million of decreased separation and related costs  vi million in cost savings from overhead reductions at our vacation exchange and rentals business  vii the absence of million of severance related expenses recorded at our vacation exchange and rentals business during  and viii million of lower corporate costs primarily related to cost containment initiatives implemented during and lower legal and professional fees

such increases were partially offset by the absence of a pre tax gain recorded during on the sale of certain vacation ownership properties and related assets 
interest expense increased million during compared with as a result of i lower capitalized interest at our vacation ownership business due to lower development of vacation ownership inventory and ii higher interest paid on our long term debt facilities due to an increase in our revolving credit facility balance 
interest income increased million during compared with the difference between our effective tax rate of and effective tax rate of is primarily due to i the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge recorded during  ii charges in a tax free zone resulting from currency conversion losses related to the transfer of cash from our venezuelan operations at our vacation exchange and rentals business and iii a non cash impairment charge related to the write off of an investment in a non performing joint venture at our vacation exchange and rentals business 
see note income taxes for a detailed reconciliation of our effective tax rate 
as a result of these items  our net income decreased  million as compared to following is a discussion of the results of each of our segments  interest expense income and other income net net revenues ebitda change change lodging vacation exchange and rentals vacation ownership total reportable segments corporate and other a total company less depreciation and amortization interest expense interest income income loss before income taxes not meaningful 
a includes the elimination of transactions between segments 
lodging net revenues increased million and ebitda decreased million  respectively  during compared to primarily reflecting higher international royalty  marketing and reservation revenues  incremental net revenues generated from the july acquisition of usfs  increased revenue from our wyndham rewards loyalty program and incremental property management reimbursable revenues  partially offset by lower domestic royalty  marketing and reservation revenues 
such net revenue increase was more than offset in ebitda by increased expenses  particularly associated with a strategic change in direction related to our howard johnson brand  ancillary services provided to franchisees  incremental property management reimbursable revenues  the acquisition of usfs and organizational realignment initiatives  partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives 
the acquisition of usfs contributed incremental net revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively 
apart from this acquisition  the increase in net revenues includes i million of incremental international royalty  marketing and reservation revenues resulting from international revpar growth of  or 
table of contents excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements  and a increase in international rooms  ii million of incremental revenue generated by our wyndham rewards loyalty program primarily due to increased member stays  iii million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our property management business and iv a million increase in other revenue primarily due to fees generated upon execution of franchise contracts and ancillary services that we provide to our franchisees 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in domestic royalty  marketing and reservation revenues due to a domestic revpar decline of and incremental development advance note amortization  which is recorded net within revenues 
the domestic revpar decline was principally driven by an overall decline in industry occupancy levels  while the international revpar growth was principally driven by price increases  partially offset by a decline in occupancy levels 
the million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our property management business primarily relates to payroll costs that we incur and pay on behalf of property owners  for which we are fully reimbursed by the property owner 
as the reimbursements are made based upon cost with no added margin  the recorded revenue is offset by the associated expense and there is no resultant impact on ebitda 
ebitda further reflects i a million non cash impairment charge primarily due to a strategic change in direction related to our howard johnson brand that is expected to adversely impact the ability of the properties associated with the franchise agreements acquired in connection with the acquisition of the brand during to maintain compliance with brand standards  ii million of increased costs primarily associated with ancillary services provided to franchisees  as discussed above  and iii million of costs relating to organizational realignment initiatives see restructuring plan for more details 
such cost increases were partially offset by i million of savings from cost containment initiatives  ii million of income associated with the assumption of a lodging related credit card marketing program obligation by a third party  iii million of income associated with the sale of a non strategic asset  iv million of lower employee incentive program expenses compared to and v a net decrease of million in marketing expenses primarily relating to lower marketing spend across our brands  partially offset by incremental expenditures in our wyndham rewards loyalty program 
as of december   we had  properties and approximately  rooms in our system 
additionally  our hotel development pipeline included approximately hotels and approximately  rooms  of which were international and were new construction as of december  vacation exchange and rentals net revenues increased million and ebitda decreased million during compared with the increase in net revenues primarily reflects a million increase in net revenues from rental transactions and related services and a million increase in ancillary revenues  which includes million of favorability related to an adjustment recorded during the second quarter of that reduced asia pacific consulting revenues  partially offset by an million decrease in annual dues and exchange revenues 
ebitda reflects million of non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of certain assets based on their revised estimated fair values  million of charges due to currency conversion losses related to the transfer of cash from our venezuelan operations and million of costs relating to organizational realignment initiatives  partially offset by million in cost savings from overhead reductions  million of favorable hedging on foreign exchange contracts and the absence of million of severance related expenses recorded during net revenue and expense increases include million and million  respectively  of currency translation impact from a weaker us dollar compared to other foreign currencies 
net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during compared with excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements  net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during driven by i the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  which contributed an incremental million to revenues  and ii a increase in the average net price per rental primarily resulting from increased pricing at our landal and novasol european vacation rentals businesses 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in rental transaction volume primarily driven by lower rental volume at our other european cottage businesses as well as lower member rentals  which we believe was a result of customers altering their vacation decisions primarily due to the downturn in north america and other worldwide economies 
the decline in rental transaction volume was partially offset by increased rentals at our landal business  which benefited from enhanced marketing programs 
annual dues and exchange revenues decreased million during compared with excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange movements  annual dues and exchange revenues declined million driven by a decline in revenue generated per member  partially offset by a increase in the average number of members 
the decrease in revenue per member was driven by lower exchange transactions per member  partially offset by the impact of favorable exchange transaction pricing driven by transaction mix 
we believe that lower transactions reflect i recent heightened economic uncertainty and ii recent trends among timeshare vacation ownership developers to enroll members in private label clubs  whereby the members have the option to 
table of contents exchange within the club or through rci channels 
such trends have a positive impact on the average number of members but an offsetting effect on the number of exchange transactions per average member 
an increase in ancillary revenues of million was driven by i the million asia pacific adjustment  as discussed above  and ii million from various sources  which include fees from additional services provided to transacting members  club servicing revenues  fees from our credit card loyalty program and fees generated from programs with affiliated resorts  partially offset by million due to the unfavorable translation effects of foreign exchange movements 
ebitda further reflects an increase in expenses of million primarily driven by i charges of million due to currency conversion losses related to the transfer of cash from our venezuelan operations  ii non cash impairment charges of million due to trademark and fixed asset write downs resulting from a strategic change in direction and reduced future investments in a vacation rentals business  iii million of increased resort services expenses as a result of the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  as discussed above  iv the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on expenses of million  v a non cash impairment charge of million due to the write off of our investment in a non performing joint venture  vi million of costs relating to organizational realignment initiatives see restructuring plan for more details  vii a million increase in volume related expenses  which was substantially comprised of incremental costs to support growth in rental transaction volume at our landal business  as discussed above  higher rental inventory fulfillment costs and increased staffing costs to support member growth  viii million of higher employee incentive program expenses compared to and ix million of consulting costs on researching the improvement of web based search and booking functionalities 
such increases were partially offset by i million of favorable hedging on foreign exchange contracts  ii million in cost savings from overhead reductions  iii the absence of million of severance related expenses recorded during and iv million of lower marketing expenses primarily due to timing 
vacation ownership net revenues and ebitda decreased million and  million  respectively  during compared with during october  we announced plans to refocus our vacation ownership sales and marketing efforts on consumers with higher credit quality beginning in the fourth quarter of as a result  operating results reflect costs related to realignment initiatives and decreased gross voi sales 
results also reflect a higher provision for loan losses  partially offset by growth in consumer finance income  as well as lower cost of sales and decreased employee related expenses 
during december  we announced an acceleration of our initiatives to increase cash flow and reduce our need to access the asset backed securities market by reducing the sales pace of our vacation ownership business

in addition  management performed its annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas during the fourth quarter of we used a discounted cash flow model and incorporated assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize

gross sales of vois at our vacation ownership business decreased million during compared to  as tour flow and vpg remained relatively unchanged 
an increase in upgrades was more than offset by a decrease in sales to new customers 
the positive impact to tour flow from the continued growth of our in house sales programs  albeit slower than during due to the impact of negative economic conditions faced during  was offset by the closure of over sales offices 
the positive impact to vpg from a favorable tour mix and higher pricing was offset by a decrease in sales to new customers 
we believe that the positive impact to upgrades resulted from increased pricing  a larger owner base  new resorts and more units 
net revenues were favorably impacted by million of incremental property management fees primarily as a result of growth in the number of units under management 
such revenue increase was more than offset by i an increase of million in our provision for loan losses during as compared to primarily due to a higher estimate of uncollectible receivables as a percentage of voi sales financed and ii a million decrease in ancillary revenues associated with bonus points credits that are provided as purchase incentives on voi sales 
the trend of higher uncollectible receivables as a percentage of voi sales financed has continued since the fourth quarter of as the strains of the overall economy appear to be negatively impacting the borrowers in our portfolio  particularly those with lower credit scores 
while the continued impact of the economy is uncertain  we have taken measures that  over time  should leave us with a smaller portfolio that has a stronger credit profile

lodging net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared with primarily reflecting strong revpar gains across the majority of our brands  the success of our wyndham rewards loyalty program and incremental property management reimbursable revenues 
such increases were partially offset in ebitda by increased expenses  particularly for marketing activities 
the increase in net revenues includes i million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our property management business  ii an million increase in royalty  marketing and reservation revenues  which was primarily due to revpar growth of  iii million of incremental revenue generated by our wyndham rewards loyalty program primarily due to increased member stays and iv an million increase in other revenue primarily due to fees generated upon execution of franchise contracts and ancillary services that we provide to our franchisees 
the million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our property management business primarily relates to payroll costs that we incur and pay on behalf of property owners  for which we are reimbursed by the property owner 
as the reimbursements are made based upon cost with no added margin  the recorded revenue is offset by the associated expense and there is no resultant impact on ebitda 
the million increase in royalty  marketing and reservation revenues was substantially driven by price increases  as well as occupancy increases  reflecting the beneficial impact of management and marketing initiatives and an increased focus on quality enhancements  including strengthening our brand standards  as well as an overall improvement in the economy and midscale lodging segments  which are the segments where we primarily compete

net revenue and expense increases include million and million  respectively  of currency translation from a weaker us dollar compared to other foreign currencies 
net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during driven by i a increase in rental transaction volume  ii a increase in the average net price per rental or  excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements and iii the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  which contributed an incremental million to revenues or to average net price per rental 
excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements and the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  the increase in average net price per rental was primarily a result of mix shift of rental activity to higher premium destinations 
the growth in rental transaction volume was driven by increased rentals at our landal and novasol european vacation rental businesses  which primarily resulted from i enhanced marketing programs initiated to support an expansion strategy to provide consumers with broader inventories and more destinations and ii improved local economies 
the growth in rental transactions was also the result of increased rentals in latin america due to increased marketing efforts and broader distribution channels 
such growth was partially offset by a decline in rci member rentals in europe  decreased cottage rentals in the domestic united kingdom cottage market primarily due to severe weather conditions during and a decline in cottage and apartment rentals at french destinations 
the increase in net revenues from rental transactions includes the translation effects of foreign exchange movements  which favorably impacted net rental revenues by million 
annual dues and exchange revenues increased million during as compared with primarily due to a increase in the average number of members 
annual dues and exchange revenue per member was relatively flat during as compared to as a result of favorable transaction pricing  which was offset by a decline in exchange transactions per average member 
the timing of intervals and points deposits and the mix of intervals and points to be utilized during compared with contributed to the decline in exchange transactions per average member 
in addition  we believe that trends among timeshare vacation ownership developers are i to sell multiyear products  whereby the members have access to the product every second or third year and ii to enroll members in private label clubs  whereby the members have the option to exchange within the club or through other rci channels 
such trends have a positive impact on the average number of members but an offsetting effect on the number of exchange transactions per average member 
ancillary revenues decreased due to the absence of million of consulting revenues in our asia pacific region recorded during but not repeated during and a million adjustment recorded during the second quarter of relating to previously recorded consulting revenues in our asia pacific region 
such decreases were partially offset by million of increased revenues during from various sources  which include fees from additional services provided to transacting members  club servicing revenues  fees from our credit card loyalty program and fees generated from programs with affiliates

the impact of these operational changes in resulted in higher net revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively  that were not replicated during such growth was partially offset by incremental expenses during as compared to gross sales of vois at our vacation ownership business increased million during  driven principally by a increase in tour flow and an increase in vpg 
tour flow was positively impacted by the continued development of our in house sales programs and the opening of new sales locations 
vpg benefited from a favorable tour mix  improved efficiency in our upgrade program and higher pricing 
net revenues were impacted during by i million of incremental property management fees primarily as a result of growth in the number of units under management and ii million of increased ancillary revenues resulting from higher voi sales 
such revenue increases were partially offset by an increase of million in our provision for loan losses primarily due to higher financed voi sales during as compared to during both and  gross sales of vois were reduced by million of revenue that is deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  a portion of the total revenue from a vacation ownership contract sale is not recognized if the construction of the vacation resort has not yet been fully completed 
such revenue will be recognized in future periods in proportion to the costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs for completion of construction of the vacation resort 
due to the strong sales pace and the timing of product construction  we anticipate an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million during this deferred revenue is expected to be realized during future periods and there is no impact to our consolidated statement of cash flows

see liquidity risk for a description of the anticipated impact on our securitizations from the adverse conditions suffered by the united states asset backed securities and commercial paper markets 
ebitda further reflects an increase of approximately million in operating  marketing and administrative expenses  exclusive of incremental interest expense on our securitized debt and the impact of the operational changes made in in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 primarily resulting from i million of increased cost of sales primarily associated with increased voi sales  ii million of incremental marketing expenses to support sales efforts  iii million of additional commission expense associated with increased voi sales  iv million of increased costs related to the property management services  as discussed above  v million of incremental costs primarily incurred to fund additional staffing needs to support continued growth in the business and vi million of costs related to sales incentives awarded to owners 
such increases were partially offset by a million decrease in costs related to our separation from cendant  primarily related to the absence of an impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of due to a rebranding initiative for our fairfield and trendwest trademarks 
in addition  we recorded two items during the second quarter of related to a prior acquisition an additional litigation settlement reserve of million  partially offset by the reversal of a million reserve due to the resolution of a vendor related tax liability resulting from such acquisition

as a result of these changes  certain positions were eliminated and severance benefits and outplacement services were provided for impacted employees resulting in costs of million 
we expect additional costs of approximately million to million during the first quarter of vacation exchange and rentals our strategic realignment in our vacation exchange and rentals business streamlined exchange operations primarily across its international businesses by reducing management layers to improve regional accountability 
such plan resulted in million in restructuring costs during we expect additional costs of approximately million to million during the first quarter of vacation ownership our vacation ownership business refocused its sales and marketing efforts by closing the least profitable sales offices and eliminating marketing programs that were producing prospects with lower credit quality 
consequently  we have decreased the level of timeshare development  reduced our need to access the asset backed securities market and enhanced the cash flow from the business unit 
such realignment includes the elimination of certain positions  the termination of leases of certain sales offices  the termination of development projects and the write off of assets related to the sales offices 
these initiatives resulted in costs of million during we expect additional costs of approximately million to million during the first quarter of total company these strategic realignments  including the termination of approximately  employees  resulted in total restructuring costs of million during  of which million was paid in cash and million was a non cash expense

in addition  we spent million relating to vacation ownership development projects during we believe that our vacation ownership business will have adequate inventory through and thus we plan to sell the vacation ownership inventory that is currently on our balance sheet and complete vacation ownership projects currently under development 
as a result  we anticipate reducing our spending to approximately million to million on vacation ownership development projects during and approximately million during we expect that the majority of the expenditures that will be required to pursue our capital spending programs  strategic investments and vacation ownership development projects will be financed with cash flow generated through operations 
additional expenditures are financed with general unsecured corporate borrowings  including through the use of available capacity under our million revolving credit facility

as discussed below  the irs has commenced an audit of cendant s taxable years through  during which we were included in cendant s tax returns 
the rules governing taxation are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
therefore  our tax accruals reflect a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our tax accruals are reasonable  tax audits and any related litigation could result in tax liabilities for us that are materially different than those reflected in our historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
the result of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision  net income  and or cash flows in the period or periods to which such audit or litigation relates 
our recorded tax liabilities in respect of such taxable years represent our current best estimates of the probable outcome with respect to certain tax positions taken by cendant for which we would be responsible under the tax sharing agreement 
as discussed above  however  the rules governing taxation are complex and subject to varying interpretation 
there can be no assurance that the irs will not propose adjustments to the returns for which we would be responsible under the tax sharing agreement or that any such proposed adjustments would not be material 
any determination by the irs or a court that imposed tax liabilities on us under the tax sharing agreement in excess of our tax accruals could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision  net income  and or cash flows  which is the result of our obligations under the separation and distribution agreement  as discussed in note separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries 
we recorded million of tax liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement at december   which is recorded within due to former parent and subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheet 
we expect the payment on a majority of these liabilities to occur during the second half of we expect to make such payment from cash flow generated through operations and the use of available capacity under our million revolving credit facility

as debt maturities of the securitized vacation ownership debt are based on the contractual payment terms of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables  actual maturities may differ as a result of prepayments by the vacation ownership contract receivable obligors 
the revolving credit facility  unsecured term loan and vacation ownership bank borrowings include covenants  including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
these financial covenants consist of a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least times as of the measurement date and a maximum leverage ratio not to exceed times on the measurement date 
the interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and note segment information by interest expense as defined in the credit agreement  excluding interest expense on any securitization indebtedness and on non recourse indebtedness as the two terms are defined in the credit agreement  both as measured on a trailing month basis preceding the measurement date 
as of december   our interest coverage ratio was times 
the leverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated total indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement excluding any securitization indebtedness and any non recourse secured debt as of the measurement date by ebitda as measured on a trailing month basis preceding the measurement date 
as of december   our leverage ratio was times 
covenants in these credit facilities also include limitations on indebtedness of material subsidiaries  liens  mergers  consolidations  liquidations  dissolutions and sales of all or substantially all assets  and sale and leasebacks 
events of default in these credit facilities include nonpayment of principal when due  nonpayment of interest  fees or other amounts  violation of covenants  cross payment default and cross acceleration in each case  to indebtedness excluding securitization indebtedness in excess of million  and a change of control the definition of which permitted our separation from cendant 
the senior unsecured notes contain various covenants including limitations on liens  limitations on sale and leasebacks  and change of control restrictions 
in addition  there are limitations on mergers  consolidations and sales of all or substantially all assets 
events of default in the notes include nonpayment of interest  nonpayment of principal  breach of a covenant or warranty  cross acceleration of debt in excess of million  and bankruptcy related matters 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants described above including the required financial ratios 
each of our non recourse  securitized note borrowings contain various triggers relating to the performance of the applicable loan pools 
for example  if the vacation ownership contract receivables pool that collateralizes one of our securitization notes fails to perform within the parameters established by the contractual triggers such as higher default or delinquency rates  there are provisions pursuant to which the cash flows for that pool will be maintained in the securitization as extra collateral for the note holders or applied to amortize the outstanding principal held by the noteholders 
in the event such provisions were triggered during  we believe such cash flows would be approximately million 
as of december   all of our securitized pools were in compliance with applicable triggers 
liquidity risk our vacation ownership business finances certain of its receivables through i an asset backed bank conduit facility and ii periodically accessing the capital markets by issuing asset backed securities 
none of the currently outstanding asset backed securities contain any recourse provisions to us other than interest rate risk related to swap counterparties solely to the extent that the amount outstanding on our notes differs from the forecasted amortization schedule at the time of issuance 
certain of these asset backed securities are insured by monoline insurers 
currently  the monoline insurers that we have used in the past and other guarantee insurance providers are no longer aaa rated and remain under significant ratings pressure 
since certain monoline insurers are not positioned to write new policies  the cost of 
table of contents such insurance has increased and the insurance has become difficult or impossible to obtain due to i decreased competition in that business  including a reduced number of monolines that may issue new policies due to either a loss of aaa aaa ratings from the rating agencies or b lack of confidence of market participants in the value of such insurance and ii the increased spreads paid to bond investors 
our million term securitization  which closed on may   and our million term securitization  which closed on june   were senior subordinate transactions with no monoline insurance 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing throughout and into  the asset backed securities market and commercial paper markets in the united states suffered adverse market conditions 
as a result  during  our cost of securitized borrowings increased due to increased spreads over relevant benchmarks 
we successfully accessed the term securitization market during  as demonstrated by the closing of two term securitizations 
however  the credit markets continue to be virtually closed to issuers of vacation ownership receivables asset backed securities 
in response to the tightened asset backed credit environment  our plan is to reduce our need to access the asset backed securities market during on november   we closed on a day  million  non recourse  securitized vacation ownership bank conduit facility which is supported by commercial paper effective through november the million facility capacity represents a decrease from the billion capacity of our previous bank conduit facility 
we expect that our vacation ownership business may reduce its sales pace of vois from to by approximately 
accordingly  we believe that this bank conduit facility should provide sufficient liquidity for the lower expected sales pace and we expect to have available liquidity to finance the sale of vois 
the bank conduit facility had available capacity of million as of december  the previous bank conduit facility ceased operating as a revolving facility on october  and will amortize in accordance with its terms  which is expected to be approximately two years 
the bank conduit facility bears interest at variable commercial paper rates  at higher spreads than the previous bank conduit facility 
the bank conduit facility has a lower advance rate at approximately for new borrowings compared to the previous bank conduit facility at approximately 
as a result of the current credit market  the terms of the bank conduit facility are less favorable than the previous bank conduit facility 
as such  in conjunction with closing the bank conduit facility  we drew approximately million on our revolving credit facility to bring our previous bank conduit facility in line with the lower advance rate and tighter eligibility requirements 
at december   we have million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent that the recent increases in funding costs in the securitization and commercial paper markets persist  it will negatively impact the cost of such borrowings 
a long term disruption to the asset backed or commercial paper markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain such financings 
our wyndham vacation resorts asia pacific pty ltd 
operations are funded by day bank facilities with a total capacity of million as of december  expiring in june these facilities had a total of million outstanding as of december  and are secured by consumer loan receivables  as well as a wyndham worldwide corporation guaranty 
we are in active dialogue with the participating banks and potential new participants 
our goal is to renew this facility for another day term prior to the current renewal date 
while we expect to renew the agreement  we anticipate that current bank lending conditions will have a negative impact on the terms and capacity of the existing agreement 
in addition to renewing the current agreement  we are exploring alternate financing means including an asset backed securitization conduit 
in the event we are not able to renew all or part of the current agreement  all or a portion of the outstanding borrowings will become immediately due and payable 
we anticipate that we would have adequate liquidity to meet these maturities with available cash balances and our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we can reduce funding needs by slowing spending on new inventory and reducing the financing of consumer loans used to purchase our vacation ownership properties 
some of our vacation ownership developments are supported by surety bonds provided by affiliates of certain insurance companies in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states 
in the ordinary course of our business  we have assembled commitments from thirteen surety providers in the amount of billion  of which we had million outstanding as of december  the availability  terms and conditions  and pricing of such bonding capacity is dependent on  among other things  continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing such bonding capacity  the general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating 
if such bonding capacity is unavailable or  alternatively  the terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity may be unacceptable to us  the cost of development of our vacation ownership units could be negatively impacted 
our liquidity position may also be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the capital markets in which we operate or if our vacation ownership contract receivables portfolios do not meet specified portfolio credit parameters 
our liquidity as it relates to our vacation ownership contract receivables securitization program could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew or replace any of the facilities on their renewal dates or if a particular receivables pool were to fail to meet certain ratios  which could occur in certain instances if the default rates or 
table of contents other credit metrics of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables deteriorate 
our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership contract receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities 
during december  moody s investors service moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to baa and left our ratings under review for possible downgrade 
during july  standard poor s s p downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bbb with a stable outlook 
during october  s p assigned a negative outlook to our senior unsecured debt 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization 
currently  we expect no i material increase in interest expense and or ii material reduction in the availability of bonding capacity from the aforementioned downgrade or negative outlook  however  a further downgrade by moody s and or s p could impact our future borrowing and or bonding costs and availability of such bonding capacity 
as a result of the sale of realogy on april   realogy s senior debt credit rating was downgraded to below investment grade 
under the separation agreement  if realogy experienced such a change of control and suffered such a ratings downgrade  it was required to post a letter of credit in an amount acceptable to us and avis budget group to satisfy the fair value of realogy s indemnification obligations for the cendant legacy contingent liabilities in the event realogy does not otherwise satisfy such obligations to the extent they become due 
on april   realogy posted a million irrevocable standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank in favor of avis budget group and upon which demand may be made if realogy does not otherwise satisfy its obligations for its share of the cendant legacy contingent liabilities 
the letter of credit can be adjusted from time to time based upon the outstanding contingent liabilities and has an expiration of september  subject to renewal and certain provisions 
the issuance of this letter of credit does not relieve or limit realogy s obligations for these liabilities 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenues and net income from our franchise and management fees  commission income earned from renting vacation properties  annual subscription fees or annual membership dues  as applicable  and exchange transaction fees and sales of vois 
revenues from franchise and management fees are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters  because of increased leisure travel during the summer months 
revenues from rental income earned from booking vacation rentals are generally highest in the third quarter  when vacation rentals are highest 
revenues from vacation exchange transaction fees are generally highest in the first quarter  which is generally when members of our vacation exchange business plan and book their vacations for the year 
revenues from sales of vois are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in other quarters 
the seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
as we expand into new markets and geographical locations  we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past 
separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries transfer of cendant corporate liabilities and issuance of guarantees to cendant and affiliates pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  upon the distribution of our common stock to cendant shareholders  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to the assumption of certain liabilities and the obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for  while realogy is responsible for the remaining 
the amount of liabilities which we assumed in connection with the separation was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these amounts were comprised of certain cendant corporate liabilities which were recorded on the books of cendant as well as additional liabilities which were established for guarantees issued at the date of separation related to certain unresolved contingent matters and certain others that could arise during the guarantee period 
regarding the guarantees  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
we also provided a default guarantee related to certain deferred compensation arrangements related to certain current and former senior officers and directors of cendant  realogy and travelport 
these arrangements  which are discussed in more detail below  have been valued upon the separation in accordance with financial interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others and recorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent such recorded liabilities are not adequate to cover the ultimate payment amounts  such excess will be reflected as an expense to the results of operations in future periods

accounting for contingencies liability assumed at the date of separation of which million of the million pertain to litigation liabilities 
in connection with these liabilities  million are recorded in current due to former parent and subsidiaries and million are recorded in long term due to former parent and subsidiaries at december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
we are indemnifying cendant for these contingent liabilities and therefore any payments would be made to the third party through the former parent 
the million relating to the fin guarantees is recorded in other current liabilities at december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
we currently expect to pay million relating to these liabilities during and the remaining million during  although the actual timing is dependent on a variety of factors beyond our control 
in addition  at december   we have million of receivables due from former parent and subsidiaries primarily relating to income tax refunds  which is recorded in current due from former parent and subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheet 
such receivables totaled million at december  following is a discussion of the liabilities on which we issued guarantees contingent litigation liabilities we assumed of liabilities for certain litigation relating to  arising out of or resulting from certain lawsuits in which cendant is named as the defendant 
the indemnification obligation will continue until the underlying lawsuits are resolved 
we will indemnify cendant to the extent that cendant is required to make payments related to any of the underlying lawsuits 
as the indemnification obligation relates to matters in various stages of litigation  the maximum exposure cannot be quantified 
due to the inherently uncertain nature of the litigation process  the timing of payments related to these liabilities cannot be reasonably predicted  but is expected to occur over several years 
since the separation  cendant settled a number of these lawsuits and we assumed a portion of the related indemnification obligations 
as discussed above  for each settlement  we paid of the aggregate settlement amount to cendant 
our payment obligations under the settlements were greater or less than our accruals  depending on the matter 
during  cendant received an adverse order in a litigation matter for which we retain a indemnification obligation 
we have filed an appeal related to this adverse order 
as a result of the order  however  we increased our contingent litigation accrual for this matter during by million 
as a result of these settlements and payments to cendant  as well as other reductions and accruals for developments in active litigation matters  our aggregate accrual for outstanding cendant contingent litigation liabilities decreased from million at december  to million at december  contingent tax liabilities we are generally liable for of certain contingent tax liabilities 
in addition  each of us  cendant and realogy may be responsible for of certain of cendant s tax liabilities that will provide the responsible party with a future  offsetting tax benefit 
we will pay to cendant the amount of taxes allocated pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  as amended during the third quarter of  for the payment of certain taxes 
as a result of the amendment to the tax sharing agreement  we recorded a gross up of our contingent tax liability and have a corresponding deferred tax asset of million as of december  this liability will remain outstanding until tax audits related to the tax year are completed or the statutes of limitations governing the tax year have passed 
our maximum exposure cannot be quantified as tax regulations are subject to interpretation and the outcome of tax audits or litigation is inherently uncertain 
prior to the separation  we were included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns of cendant through the separation date for the period then ended 
balances due to cendant for these pre separation tax returns and related tax attributes were estimated as of december  and have since been adjusted in connection with the filing of the pre separation tax returns 
these balances will again be adjusted after the ultimate settlement of the related tax audits of these periods 
cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities we have assumed of corporate liabilities of cendant including liabilities relating to i cendant s terminated or divested businesses  ii liabilities relating to the travelport sale  if any  and iii generally any actions with respect to the separation plan or the distributions brought by any third party 
our maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified as this guarantee relates primarily to future claims that may be made against cendant 
we assessed the probability and amount of potential liability related to this guarantee based on the extent and nature of historical experience 
guarantee related to deferred compensation arrangements in the event that cendant  realogy and or travelport are not able to meet certain deferred compensation obligations under specified plans for certain current and former officers and directors because of bankruptcy or insolvency  we have guaranteed such obligations to the extent relating to amounts deferred in respect of and earlier 
this guarantee will remain outstanding until such deferred compensation balances are distributed to the respective officers and directors 
the maximum exposure cannot be quantified as the guarantee  in part  is related to the value of deferred investments as of the date of the requested distribution

we may be required to fund such excess as a result of unsold company owned vois or failure by owners to pay such assessments 
these guarantees extend for the duration of the underlying subsidy agreements which generally approximate one year and are renewable on an annual basis or until a stipulated percentage typically or higher of related vois are sold 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was approximately million as of december  we would only be required to pay this maximum amount if none of the owners assessed paid their assessments 
any assessments collected from the owners of the vois would reduce the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made by us 
additionally  should we be required to fund the deficit through the payment of any owners assessments under these guarantees  we would be permitted access to the property for its own use and may use that property to engage in revenue producing activities  such as rentals 
during  and  we made payments related to these guarantees of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of million and million  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into hotel management agreements which may provide a guarantee by us of minimum returns to the hotel owner 
under such guarantees  we are required to compensate for any shortfall over the life of the management agreement up to a specified aggregate amount 
our exposure under these guarantees is partially mitigated by our ability to terminate any such management agreement if certain targeted operating results are not met 
additionally  we are able to recapture a portion or all of the shortfall payments and any waived fees in the event that future operating results exceed targets 
the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees is million 
the underlying agreements would not require payment until or thereafter 
as of both december  and  we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of less than million on our consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations 
we pool qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sell them to bankruptcy remote entities all of which are consolidated into the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  letters of credit 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding  which mainly relate to support for development activity at our vacation ownership business 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated and combined results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in 
table of contents environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
vacation ownership revenue recognition 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues of voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in sfas no 
 accounting of sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues on voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing arrangements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
prior to  our provision for loan losses was presented as expenses on the combined statements of operations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   the provision for loan losses is now classified as a reduction of vacation ownership interest sales on the consolidated and combined statements of operations see allowance for loan losses discussed below 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenue and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
until a contract for sale qualifies for revenue recognition  all payments received are accounted for as restricted cash and deposits within other current assets and deferred income  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is recorded 
if a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale  non recoverable expenses are charged to the current period as part of operating expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the percentage of completion status of a project  which may result in difference in the timing and amount of revenue recognized from the construction of vacation ownership properties 
this policy changed upon our adoption of sfas no 
and sop  which is discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
in our vacation ownership segment  we provide for estimated vacation ownership contract receivable cancellations at the time of voi sales by recording a provision for loan losses on the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
we assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the historical performance of similar vacation ownership contract receivables 
we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis  which tracks defaults for each year s sales over the entire life of those contract receivables 
we consider current defaults  past due aging  historical write offs of contracts  consumer credit scores fico scores in the assessment of borrower s credit strength and expected loan performance 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
if current conditions differ from the conditions in effect when the historical experience was generated  we adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect the expected effects of the current environment on uncollectibility 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
and sop on january   the provision for loan losses is classified as a reduction to revenue with no change made to prior periods presented 
intangible assets 
with regard to the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with business combinations  we annually during the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to completing our annual forecasting process or  more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  review their carrying values as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the estimated 
table of contents fair value of any reporting unit within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit 
purchase business combination accounting rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared to the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount  if lower 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments 
because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises  market conditions change or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding whether existing goodwill is impaired could change and result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in performing our impairment analysis  we develop our estimated fair values for our reporting units using a combination of the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit 
the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance for a five year period 
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate  the terminal value and expected future revenues  gross margins and operating margins  which vary among reporting units 
we use a market multiple methodology to estimate the terminal value of each reporting unit by comparing such reporting unit to other publicly traded companies that are similar from an operational and economic standpoint 
the market multiple methodology compares each reporting unit to the comparable companies on the basis of risk characteristics in order to determine the risk profile relative to the comparable companies as a group 
this analysis generally focuses on quantitative considerations  which include financial performance and other quantifiable data  and qualitative considerations  which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance 
the most significant assumption affecting our estimate of the terminal value of each reporting unit is the multiple of the enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization 
to support our estimate of the individual reporting unit fair values  a comparison is performed between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our market capitalization 
we use an average of our market capitalization over a reasonable period preceding the impairment testing date as being more reflective of our stock price trend than a single day  point in time market price 
the difference is an implied control premium  which represents the acknowledgment that the observed market prices of individual trades of a company s stock may not be representative of the fair value of the company as a whole 
estimates of a company s control premium are highly judgmental and depend on capital market and macro economic conditions overall 
we evaluate the implied control premium for reasonableness 
based on the results of our impairment evaluation performed in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash  million charge for the impairment of goodwill at our vacation ownership reporting unit  where all of the goodwill previously recorded was determined to be impaired 
the aggregate carrying values of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were  million and million  respectively  as of december  and  million and million  respectively  as of december  our goodwill is allocated between our lodging million and vacation exchange and rentals  million reporting units and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among our three reporting units 
we continue to monitor the goodwill recorded at our lodging and vacation exchange and rentals reporting units for indicators of impairment 
if economic conditions were to deteriorate more than expected  or other significant assumptions such as estimates of terminal value were to change significantly  we may be required to record an impairment of the goodwill balance at our lodging and vacation and exchange and rentals reporting units 

table of contents business combinations 
a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
we account for business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and related literature 
accordingly  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of purchase 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we use various recognized valuation methods including present value modeling and referenced market values where available 
further  we make assumptions within certain valuation techniques including discount rates and timing of future cash flows 
valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management s supervision  where appropriate 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use 
however  such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting for restructuring activities 
we have committed and may continue to commit to restructuring actions and activities associated with strategic realignment initiatives targeted principally at reducing costs  enhancing organizational efficiency and consolidating and rationalizing existing processes and facilities  which are accounted for under sfas no 
 employers accounting for post employment benefits and sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
our restructuring actions require us to make significant estimates in several areas including i expenses for severance and related benefit costs  ii the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations  and iii contract terminations 
the amounts that we have accrued at december  represent our best estimate of the obligations that we expect to incur in connection with these actions  but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts and interest rate caps to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt 
foreign currency forwards and options are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed 
table of contents information about these financial instruments is provided in note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure as of december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and asset backed commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
in addition  interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can impact us 
we anticipate that libor and asset backed commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound and euro 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest rates 
we have approximately billion of debt outstanding as of december  of that total  billion was issued as variable rate debt and has not been synthetically converted to fixed rate debt via an interest rate swap 
a hypothetical change in our effective weighted average interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by million 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate carrying values due to the short term nature of these assets 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of vacation ownership contract receivables 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt and interest rate derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of our foreign currency derivatives used by us to hedge underlying exposure that primarily consist of the non functional current assets and liabilities of us and our subsidiaries 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures as of december  the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying assets  liabilities or expected cash flows 
at december   the absolute notional amount of our outstanding hedging instruments was million 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease of million in the fair value of the hedging instrument at december  such a change would be largely offset by an opposite effect on the underlying assets  liabilities and expected cash flows 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december  market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates
