overview we are a leading designer of high quality precious metal jewelry in china  developing  promoting  and selling a broad range of products in the large and rapidly expanding chinese luxury goods market 
our products consist of a range of unique styles and designs made from precious metals such as platinum  gold  and karat gold k gold 
we also produce jewelry items that contain diamonds and other precious stones on a custom order basis 
we continuously innovate and change our designs based upon consumer trends in china 
by continuously creating new designs and rapidly bringing them to market  we are able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and strengthen our brand identity 
our design database presently contains over  unique products 
we have historically sold our products directly to distributors  retailers and other wholesalers  who then sell our products to consumers through both retail counters located in department stores and in other traditional stand alone jewelry stores 
in the coastal cities of china  we believe the demand for platinum and gemstone products has been increasing 
in order to capitalize on the growth in demand  we intend to develop platinum as one of the primary metals from which our jewelry is manufactured 
in  we began to shift our product line to produce more platinum jewelry and we intend to invest in the development of a new production line to produce finished gemstone platinum jewelry 
the production lead time of platinum products  starting from purchase of raw materials and ending with finished products  is about six to eight days  while the lead time for gold products is about two to four days 
lead time also varies on the complexity of production and design of our products 
as such  we anticipate that more working capital will be needed to support this shift of product mix 
our wholesale prices are based on the spot prices of the raw material that make up our products  with the spot price measured at the time our products are sold 
similarly  the value of our inventory on hand is based on spot prices of the raw materials that make up the inventory 
we record the value of our inventory at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
our gross margin is therefore affected by changes in the price of raw materials 
the increase in our net sales for the year ended december  and the value of inventory as of december  was due in part to the general increase in the market value of precious metals and  to a lesser extent  our expansion of our retail business by our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the temix companies 
any fluctuation in the spot price of precious metal would result in a change in our wholesale revenue and our gross margin  as our sales price is based  in part  on the spot price of the precious metal contained in the product sold 
we cannot predict and foresee the volatility of the market value of precious metals in the future 
we closely monitor the market price of precious metals and  commencing in the fourth quarter of  have entered into certain gold futures contracts with our supplier  shanghai gold exchange  to manage our consolidated exposure to changes in inventory values due to fluctuations in market prices 
gold futures offered by shanghai gold exchange are designed for full members to hedge or to acquire inventory at a preset price 
our futures contracts are not considered as hedges for accounting purposes 
we do not conduct any trading or speculating of these precious metals 
in order to capture the margin appreciation from direct sales to the consumer  we  in  initiated a retail strategy 
during  we opened and or acquired retail counters and acquired seven retail stores in municipalities and provincial capitals throughout china 
a majority of these retail locations were acquired in august  when we acquired substantially all of the assets of the temix companies 
as of december   we held a total of retail counters in two department stores located in shenyang  retail counters in beijing  retail counters in dalian and retail counters in other regions in china under the fuqi brand 
as of the same date  we held a total of twenty three retail counters in beijing and twenty retail counters and seven retail stores in shanghai under the temix brand 
total retail sales generated by our counters and retail stores for the year ended december  was approximately million  which was approximately of our sales for the fiscal year 
as of december   we had jewelry retail counters and stores in china 
during  we intend to open and or acquire additional retail counters and retail stores throughout the prc 
our retail operations are discussed more fully below under the caption retail operations 
by initiating our retail strategy  we intend to enhance our profitability in and further develop our brand reputation 
we originally produced studded jewelry products on a custom order basis only  but we have recently expanded our production to include new lines of studded jewelry products for sale in our retail outlets 
we believe our new retail strategy creates a significant opportunity for us to both improve our return on capital and increase shareholder value 
there are  however  risks related to our planned expansion 
our retail expansion strategy will largely depend on our ability to find sites for  open and operate new retail locations successfully 
our ability to open and operate new retail locations successfully depends on several factors  including  among others  our ability to identify suitable counter and store locations  the availability of which is outside our control  purchase and negotiate acceptable lease terms  prepare counters and stores for opening within budget  source sufficient levels of inventory at acceptable costs to meet the needs of new counters and stores  secure required governmental permits and approvals  successfully integrate new counters and stores into our existing operations  and generate sufficient operating cash flows or secure adequate capital on commercially reasonable terms to fund our expansion plans 
any failure to successfully open and operate new retail counters and stores could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
in addition  our retail expansion program will place increased demands on our operational  managerial and administrative resources 
these increased demands could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which  in turn  could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our overall business 
recent events acquisition of temix on august   we acquired substantially all of the assets of shanghai tian mei jewelry co  ltd 
and beijing yinzhong tian mei jewelry co  ltd  collectively referred to as the temix companies 
the temix companies are a outlet branded jewelry store chain with locations primarily in beijing  shanghai and ningbo

the shares held in escrow will be subject to indemnification claims and conditions of the temix companies meeting certain performance targets as set forth in the ip transfer agreement 
also  in connection with and as a condition to the closing of the asset purchase agreement and ip transfer agreement  the company entered into an employment agreement with mr 
huang  pursuant to which he will serve as our associate retail director 
the employment agreement has a term of three years unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
corporate history we operate through our wholly owned subsidiary fuqi international holdings co  ltd  a british virgin islands corporation fuqi bvi and its wholly owned subsidiary  shenzhen fuqi jewelry co  ltd  fuqi china a company established under the laws of the people s republic of china 
our company s principal office is in the city of shenzhen  in southern china  where we have a large scale production base that includes a modern factory of more than  square feet  a dedicated senior design  sales and marketing team  and approximately employees  including approximately company trained production workers 
we believe our current facilities provide adequate space for our planned expansion of our production lines  which will include diamond and other finished gemstone jewelry 
on november   fuqi bvi entered into a share exchange agreement with vt marketing services  inc vt and mr 
yu kwai chong  who is our current chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the directors  to effect a reverse merger transaction the reverse merger 
pursuant to the reverse merger  mr 
chong  as the sole shareholder of fuqi bvi  agreed to exchange all of his shares of fuqi bvi for shares of vt and vt agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of fuqi bvi 
vt was formed as part of the implementation of the chapter reorganization plan the visitalk plan of visitalk 
com  inc  which became effective on september  the reverse merger closed on november  and vt issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding securities of fuqi bvi 
upon the close of the reverse merger  vt became the parent of fuqi bvi and assumed the operations of fuqi bvi and its subsidiary as its sole business 
on november   vt reincorporated from arizona to nevada and on december   after the reverse merger  vt reincorporated from the nevada to delaware and changed its corporate name from vt marketing services  inc to fuqi international  inc 
the transactions contemplated by the reverse merger were intended to be a tax free transaction pursuant to the provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
for financial accounting purposes  the reverse merger was treated as a reverse acquisition by fuqi bvi  under the purchase method of accounting  and was treated as a recapitalization with fuqi bvi as the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  our historical financial statements have been prepared to give retroactive effect to the reverse acquisition completed on november   and represent the operations of fuqi bvi and its wholly owned subsidiary  fuqi china 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the most significant estimates and assumptions include valuation of inventories  provisions for income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  and purchase price allocation relating to the business acquired 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
periodically  we review all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and record the effect of any necessary adjustments 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition wholesale revenue is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of jewelry products by our customers while the retail revenue is recognized upon receipt and acceptance of jewelry products by our customers  provided in each case that the other conditions of sales are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  upon shipment when title passes  or services have been rendered  iii our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
currency reporting amounts reported are stated in us dollars  unless stated otherwise 
our functional currency is the rmb 
foreign currency transactions outside the prc are translated into rmb according to the prevailing exchange rate at the transaction dates 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet dates are translated into rmb at period end exchange rates 
for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the consolidated balance sheets of our company have been translated into us dollars at the current rates as of the end of the respective periods and the consolidated statements of income have been translated into us dollars at the weighted average rates during the periods the transactions were recognized 
the resulting translation gain adjustments are recorded as other comprehensive income in the statements of income and comprehensive income and as a separate component of statements of stockholders equity 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
we have not experienced any significant amount of bad debt in the past 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the first in first out method is used to account for gold and platinum jewelries and the specific identification method for diamond jewelries 
an inventory reserve is maintained where the cost exceeds the net realizable vale 
taxation we are incorporated in the state of delaware  and our wholly owned subsidiary  fuqi bvi  is a british virgin islands company 
we are subject to franchise taxes in delaware and us federal income taxes  but we are not currently generating any taxable operating income 
we are not subject to taxation in the british virgin islands 
fuqi bvi s wholly owned subsidiary  fuqi china  is a prc company 
prior to  we were under the preferential income tax rate of in  due to our status of being a new business 
that status expired effective january  on march   the national people s congress of china enacted a new prc enterprise income tax law  under which foreign invested enterprises and domestic companies will be subject to enterprise income tax at a uniform rate of 
the new law became effective on january  prior to the enactment of china s enterprise income tax law  which became effective from january   foreign invested enterprises  or fies  were generally subject to a state enterprise income tax plus a local income tax 
as result of the new eit law  our income tax provision increased  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
prior to effectiveness of the eit law  we had enjoyed certain preferential tax concessions and the loss of these preferential tax concessions may cause our tax liabilities to increase and our profitability to decline 
pursuant to the implementation rules to the new tax law issued in december  and the several subsequent transition rules  fuqi china has become subject to a normal rate  but are still eligible for lower rates  which are  and in   and  under the transition rules 
our effective income tax rates for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
we are also subject to a business tax on our design fees and a value added tax on the processing fee 
the business tax is borne by us while the value added tax is a component of the prices that we charge our customers 
the sum of the design fee  processing fee  and the market price of raw materials used to manufacture our products is the wholesale price at which we sell our products 
we treat the business tax as a sales related expense and thus report it under selling and marketing in our statements of income 
from the inception of fuqi china in to december   we failed to report a cumulative amount of approximately million in cash revenues related to design fees 
as of december   we had an accrual of approximately million in tax liabilities representing business tax and fees of and income tax on the unreported design revenues since inception and an accrual of approximately million in estimated penalties 
in april  the shenzhen local tax department levied a million assessment against us for unpaid business taxes  fees  and income taxes related to these unreported cash revenues up to the period from inception to december  the assessment was originally due at the end of april and subject to per day of interest and penalties thereafter 
on april   we filed for an extension of the deadline to remit these outstanding taxes payable to december   and the extension request was approved by the tax department in july on december   shenzhen city tax bureau granted a further extension to us from december  to april  on april   we appointed a registered tax agent to apply on behalf of our company for a special reduction or exemption for the unpaid tax liabilities for the period from inception to december  on may   we received a notice from the shenzhen tax department accepting our application for a tax reduction or exemption and were granted an additional period to remit our outstanding tax liabilities until august  the tax department agreed not to assess any interest and penalties during this review process until august  on august   we received a notice from the tax department conditionally agreeing to fully exempt our tax liabilities in the amount of approximately million on unreported design fee income for the period from inception of our operations in to december   provided that our common stock is successfully listed on a major overseas stock exchange within days from the date of the tax notice 
we fulfilled such condition in october and obtained acknowledgement from the shenzhen tax department in november as a result  the accrued business and income tax liabilities  and the accrued estimated and penalties totaling million  was reversed and recorded as non operating income in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  all of the design fee income starting was properly reported and accounted for and has been fully paid by the tax filing deadline 
derivative instruments commencing in the fourth quarter of  we have entered into certain gold future contracts with our supplier  shanghai gold exchange 
gold futures offered by shanghai gold exchange are designed for full members to hedge or to acquire inventory at a preset price 
we utilized these future contracts to manage our consolidated exposure to changes in inventory values due to fluctuations in market prices and are not considered as hedges for accounting purpose 
our gold futures positions are marked to market at each reporting date and all unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings currently 
these contract positions have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas r  effective january   we are required to recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfasr 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
we did not issue any stock options in and and had no outstanding options as of december  on october   we granted options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock to two executives and four directors 
we expect these options to be fully vested and therefore did not account for any forfeiture as the vesting periods of these options are relatively short 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock option awards and expensed the stock based compensation based on the vesting periods 
in august  we entered into employment agreements with three of our executive officers pursuant to which we agreed to grant stock options to acquire shares of the company s common stock with a value equal to certain percentage of our annual income before income taxes not to exceed an aggregate market value of  options to purchase totaling  shares were granted to these three executive officers 
the number of options granted was computed based on the aggregate market value of  dividing by the fair value of each option measured on december  using the black scholes option pricing model 
fair value measurement on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   except for non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis  for which application has been deferred for one year 
sfas no 
established the following fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value 
sfas no 
requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
if a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy  the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation 
our derivative financial instruments are gold futures contracts based on gold price rates  which are observable at commonly quoted intervals for the full term of the derivatives and therefore considered a level input 
purchase price allocations we accounted for our temix s acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires that the acquisition cost be allocated to the assets we acquired based on their fair values 
we make estimates and judgments in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
we base our estimate on the purchase price allocation analysis reports prepared by an independent valuation service group  which have been finalized  as well as our internal judgments based on the existing facts and circumstances 
if we were to use different judgments or assumptions  the amounts assigned to the individual assets could be materially different

the first quarter is from january to march  the second quarter is from april to june  the third quarter is from july to september  and the fourth quarter is from october to december in management s opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited information for the quarters presented 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that we might achieve for any subsequent periods 
in addition  our operating results have in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors  including the seasonality of our business and the unpredictable fluctuation of prices of precious metals 
consequently  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful  and as a result  you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance

the foregoing is subject to change at any given time as our management continually reviews our retail expansion plans  particularly in light of the recent fluctuations in the economy 
our retail operations are discussed more fully below under the caption of retail operations 
at december   we had working capital of million and no long term liabilities 
except for cash and cash equivalents  a majority of our net working capital consisted of inventories and accounts receivable  both of which increased by and  respectively  as of december  as compared to december  the increase in inventory was a result of significant purchases of raw materials of precious metals incurred towards the end of and was used to expand our sales capabilities by accepting larger sales orders from our customers during the peak holiday season 
we do not conduct any trading of our precious metal raw materials 
the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to a substantial increase in revenue generated in november and december  which is the beginning of our traditional peak season  and extending credit terms to some of our customers with high credit standings 
we typically offer certain of our customers days credit terms for payment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
we have not experienced any significant amount of bad debt since the inception of our operation 
we had outstanding short term notes payables with banks in an aggregate amount of million that are due and payable on dates between january and june our loans are secured by inventory  real properties owned by our affiliated companies and or guaranteed by our affiliates and our controlling stockholder 
we have a general banking facility line of credit with agricultural bank of china pursuant to a maximum banking facility agreement dated august  which was renewed in september and december the terms of the agreement enable us to borrow up to a maximum facility amount of million 
we executed notes payable with this bank under this facility line with terms less than one year 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the facility  with interest rates ranging from to

this facility expires in june and is secured by certain real properties owned by an affiliate company 
as of december  we had a total of million outstanding under this term loan agreement with interest rates ranging from to and is secured by certain real properties owned by an affiliate company the remaining outstanding loans are secured by our inventory  real properties owned by affiliated companies  and or guaranteed by our affiliates and our controlling stockholder and have certain restrictions and covenants 
we do not guarantee any indebtedness of our affiliates 
prior to the reverse merger in november  our then sole stockholder  mr 
yu kwai chong  who is also our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  made loans to us on a regular basis to meet short term financing needs of our company 
typically  these advances were in amounts ranging from  to million  with no more than million outstanding at any time 
we did not pay interest on any of these advances 
during the same period  mr 
chong borrowed from our company primarily to fund personal liquidity needs 
since the closing of the reverse merger  at which time mr 
chong ceased to be our sole stockholder  we have not engaged in any cash advance transactions with mr 
chong and will not engage in these transactions in the future 
prior to the reverse merger  effective in november  we paid dividends to our then sole stockholder  mr 
chong 
during the years ended december    and  we paid cash dividends of   and million  respectively  to mr 
chong 
we currently have no intention to declare further dividends in the foreseeable future 
payment of dividends is further restricted under the provisions of our existing loan agreements 
on our consolidated statements of cash flows  we recorded advances by mr 
chong to us and related repayments to him as financing activities  and advances by us to mr 
chong and related repayments by him as investing activities 
advances and repayments were not subject to written loan agreements  the advances were partially repaid within three months while the remaining portions were repaid over three months 
in accordance with sfas  we present the gross amounts of the advances and repayments in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
a substantial portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers 
if customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for our products  or to make payments in a timely manner  our liquidity and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
an economic or industry downturn could materially adversely affect the servicing of these accounts receivable  which could result in longer payment cycles  increased collections costs and defaults in excess of management s expectations 
in addition  as we increase our presence in the retail market  we expect the aging of our accounts receivable generated from sales through retail counters to increase as department stores typically defer payments to us of cash receipts collected by them on our behalf 
a significant deterioration in our ability to collect on accounts receivable could affect our cash flow and working capital position and could also impact the cost or availability of financing available to us 
we expect to expend significant resources to continue to expand our retail distribution of our jewelry in china 
we will require substantial funds of approximately million in order to finance our expansion  fund operating expenses  to develop manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities and to cover public company costs 
in addition to the funds required to open retail locations  we believed that significant working capital of approximately million will be needed to operate retail locations due to longer sales and collection cycles and higher inventory levels required to support retail stores 
we also expect to require substantial funds of approximately million to change our product mix to include more platinum products 
without these funds  we may not be able to meet these goals 
we believe that our current cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including our cash needs for working capital  for the next months 
we believe that the sources of the funding for our expected expenditures in include our current cash and cash flow from operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and retained earnings of approximately million 
however  net cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  and there is no guarantee that we be able to generate positive cash flow from operations for the year ending december  in addition  we may require additional cash resources due to our inability to generate positive cash flow from our operations  changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financing or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners 
we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all  and any available additional financing may not be adequate to meet our goals 
moreover  any equity financing would result in dilution to stockholders 
if we cannot raise additional funds when needed  or on acceptable terms  we may not be able to effectively execute our growth strategy including expanding our business to the retail market  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
in addition  we may be required to scale back or discontinue our production and development program  or obtain funds through strategic alliances that may require us to relinquish certain rights 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated years ended december  in thousands net cash used for provided by operating activities net cash used for provided by investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease increase in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year net cash used for provided by operating activities 
net cash used for operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used for operating activities of million for the same period in the million decrease was primarily due to a increase in inventory in the amount of million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of million during the same period in  in additional to an increase of accounts payable in the amount of million during the year compared to an increase of  in the same period in net cash used for operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operations of million for the same period in the million decrease was primarily due to an increase in inventory in the amount of million during the year ended december  compared to an increase of  during the same period in  in addition to an increase of accounts receivable in the amount of million during the year compared to an increase of million in the same period in net cash used for provided by investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used for investing activities of  for the year ended december  the change was due to million cash paid for business acquisitions and million spent on additional plant assets 
net cash used for investing activities amounted to approximately  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change was due to an increase in restricted cash of approximately  in addition to the absence of loans and related repayments between our controlling stockholder and us  as had occurred during the year of net cash provided by used for financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period of the decrease of cash provided was primarily a result of increased bank loan of million and no further capital raised since the initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used for financing activities of  for the same period of the increase of cash provided was primarily a result of net proceeds of million raised from the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  in addition to net proceeds of million from the exercise of warrants that occurred during the second quarter of contractual obligations the following table describes our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  payments due by period in contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years short term borrowings lease of plant office lease of staff dormitory employment agreements of executive officers and new labor contract law in october  we entered into three year employment contracts with our five executive officers each of which includes a fixed amount of annual salary and stock options to purchase the company s common stock 
see stock based compensation and item of part iii  for additional information 
effective january   the prc introduced a new labor contract law that enhances rights for the nation s workers  including open ended work contracts and severance pay 
the legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers  restricts the use of temporary laborers and makes it harder to lay off employees 
it also requires that employees with short term contracts become full time employees with lifetime benefits after a short term contract is renewed twice 
the new labor contract law has increased our labor costs  but we do not believe such increases have been material to our results of operations  such labor expenses have not historically been material to our operating cost 
retail operations in april  we entered into a transfer agreement with an unrelated party the transferor  which has operation agreements with department stores for five jewelry retail counters 
under the terms of the agreement  the transferor agreed to assign all of the operation rights to us for a fee of  which was payable in three separate installments 
on october   after the transferor was not able to complete the transfer of the counters  we entered into a cancellation agreement with the transferor to terminate the transfer transaction as of november  prior to the termination of the transfer  we had obtained temporary operation rights from the transferor to operate these counters  and revenue derived from these five retail counters from the period of may to november amounted to  pursuant to the cancellation agreement  we were not obligated to pay the  transfer fee of  all the inventory remained in the five counter stores at the last day of the operation was sold to the transferor based on the pre determined price 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance due to the transferor 
subsequent to the cancellation agreement  in november  we entered into one year operating agreements to operate retail jewelry counters at two department stores located in the shenyang region 
we agreed to pay the department stores a commission fee ranging to based on types of jewelry sales generated in these jewelry counters 
fees paid to the two department stores totaled  in and  in and are included in cost of sales expenses in and marketing expenses in we recognize revenues when the titles of the merchandises are transferred to the ultimate consumers 
sales generated from counters in these two department stores totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company opened a total of sixteen new retail counters  of which thirteen of the counters are under the fuqi brand and three counters are under the temix brand 
including the retail counters and shops acquired through the temix acquisition  the company had a total of jewelry counters and jewelry shops located in beijing  shanghai  and other prc regions as of december  the retail counters and shops are operating under operating leases with terms ranging from months to year with options of extensions 
a majority of the leases require payment of contingent rent based on a percentage of store sales 
the leasing agreements for five of the retail shops provide for the payment of fees under a fixed rate rent ranging from to  fees paid to the department stores and shopping malls totaling   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  are included in selling and marketing expenses 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature 
our sales and net income are generally higher in the fourth calendar quarter than the rest of the year 
the primary factors that affect the seasonal changes in our business operations are holidays and traditional chinese festivals 
in the fourth quarter  retailers often experience increased sales due to the weeklong public holiday for chinese national day  as well as christmas and new year s day 
in addition  jewelry retailers commonly stock up from wholesalers in the fourth quarter to prepare for potentially higher sales in the following quarter for chinese new year 
this quarter is also a peak season for marriages and the birth of newborns in china  which have historically resulted in higher sales 
this seasonal trend in our business would slightly shift in line with the gap between calendar quarter and lunar quarter and occurred during and however  there was a slight variation during because of rising precious metal prices in the fourth quarter of  many customers delayed their orders until the first quarter of  resulting in lower than expected sales volume in the fourth quarter of  and higher than expected sales in the first quarter of we experienced increased sales in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   our results of operations appeared to return to the trend of higher sales in the fourth quarter 
off balance sheet transactions we have no material off balance sheet transactions 
impact of recent currency exchange rate increase we use the us dollar as the reporting currency for our financial statements 
our operations are conducted through our prc operating subsidiary  fuqi china  and our functional currency is the rmb 
on july   the prc government changed its policy of pegging the value of the rmb to the us dollar and  as a result  the rmb has appreciated against the us dollar by approximately from on july  to on december  in converting our rmb income statement amounts into us dollars we used the following rmb exchange rates for  for  and for our operating results in  and have benefited as a result of appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar 
there is no guarantee that we will benefit from the exchange rate in the future and our operations may suffer if a less favorable exchange rate develops 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations revised sfas r 
sfas r is relevant to all transactions or events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize any assets and noncontrolling interest acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date 
liabilities related to contingent consideration are recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of the consideration may be resolved beyond a reasonable doubt 
this revised approach replaces sfas s cost allocation process in which the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value 
sfas r requires any acquisition related costs and restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred as opposed to allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as previously required by sfas under sfas r  an acquirer recognizes liabilities for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting only if the requirements of sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  are met 
sfas r allows for the recognition of pre acquisition contingencies at fair value only if these contingencies are likely to materialize 
if this criterion is not met at the acquisition date  then the acquirer accounts for the non contractual contingency in accordance with recognition criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for contingencies  in which case no amount should be recognized in purchase accounting 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after december  the company is in the process of assessing the potential impact the adoption of sfas r may have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we use the us dollar as the reporting and functional currency for our financial statements 
as we conduct our operations through our prc subsidiary  the functional currency of our prc subsidiary is rmb 
substantially all our revenue and related expenses  including cost of revenues and advertising expenses  are denominated and paid in rmb 
transactions in other currencies are recorded in rmb at the rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions occur 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are remeasured into rmb at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates 
exchange gains and losses are recorded in our statements of operations as other comprehensive income 
the value of rmb is subject to changes in china s governmental policies and to international economic and political developments 
in january   the prc government implemented a unitary managed floating rate system 
under this system  the people s bank of china  or pboc  began publishing a daily base exchange rate with reference primarily to the supply and demand of rmb against the us dollar and other foreign currencies in the market during the previous day 
authorized banks and financial institutions are allowed to quote buy and sell rates for rmb within a specified band around the central bank s daily exchange rate 
on july   pboc announced an adjustment of the exchange rate of the us dollar to rmb from to and modified the system by which the exchange rates are determined 
this modification has resulted in an approximate appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar from july  to december  while the international reaction to the rmb revaluation has generally been positive  there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy  which could result in further fluctuation of the exchange rate of rmb against the us dollar 
as all of our net revenues are recorded in rmb  any future devaluation of rmb against the dollar could negatively impact our results of operations 
interest rate risk as of december   we had million outstanding under short term credit facilities from banks  with interest rates ranging from to 
as all of these borrowings are short term borrowings  we believe our exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
inflation according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the inflation rate in china reached a high point of in as compared to the past several years 
the inflation rate in china was in and in many of our operating expenses were increased and are also expected to increase with inflation 
in management s opinion  changes in revenues  net earnings and inventory valuation that have resulted from inflation and changing prices have not been material during the years presented 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on our overall operating costs will be greater for us than for our competitors within china 
commodity price sensitivity as a leading designer and wholesaler of high quality precious metal jewelry in china  we believe that we have to maintain a sufficient inventory to meet demands for our products based on customer orders  sales projection and finished goods for sales to retailers  who will purchase from our show room in our head office in shenzhen 
we are exposed to market risk in connection with our inventory balances  which are comprised primarily of gold  platinum  and jewelry made from gold and platinum 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first in  first out method for gold and platinum jewelries and the specific identification method for diamond jewelries 
if there is a downward change in the market price of gold  we are required to mark down the value of our inventory and record a loss in our statement of income 
we cannot predict the extent to which high raw material price levels will continue in the future 
we do not have any long term raw material purchase contracts 
in attempt to protect us against price increases of precious metals  we  in december  entered into future purchase contracts with our supplier  the shanghai gold exchange  to purchase gold 
as of december   the fair value of the future gold contracts outstanding was approximately  which was recorded as gold future contracts under current assets 
the gain derived from these contracts of approximately  was classified as gain from derivative instrument in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
