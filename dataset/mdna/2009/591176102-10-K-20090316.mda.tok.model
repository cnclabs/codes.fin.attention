december  september  june  march  december  september  june  n a march  n a the year was a year of extremes 
during the first half of the year  strong emerging market demand  supply bottlenecks and rapidly rising investor demand pushed the prices of many commodities to historically high levels 
in early july  however  as the severity of the us slowdown and the ripple effects it was having on global growth became increasingly apparent  the significant price increases rapidly reversed course 
the results of the scrap metal recycling segment operations depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the northeastern united states 
industrial metal prices increased sharply in the first quarter of on strong demand from emerging markets  particularly china 
brazil  russia  india and china the bric countries have made an increasingly large contribution to world gross domestic product growth since supply disruptions and rising costs also provided support to industrial metal prices in the first half of this year 
power disruptions in south africa  latin america and china since the beginning of have been notable examples  affecting in particular aluminum production 
high oil prices and freight rates provided further support to industrial metals prices over the first half of oil and freight prices have subsequently fallen sharply from their record highs 
industrial metal prices have dropped sharply since mid with renewed financial market turmoil triggering global recession fears 
global demand in industries with relatively intensive metals usage particularly automotive and housing has deteriorated in developed markets and slowed in most developing countries 

table of contents ferrous recyclers saw steep price declines in the latter part of after record high prices mid year 
steelmakers reacted to soft second half demand for finished steel products and reduced fourth quarter steelmaking schedules or moved up maintenance outages 
prices for non ferrous metals reached record levels in and fell sharply in the second half of on fears of a prolonged recession due in part to the world wide credit crisis 
the global economic downturn resulted in lower automobile demand  which in turn resulted in falling consumption and prices of pgm material in the second half of the year 
the desire for an alternative fuel  both for automobiles and to power homes  has led to a large global public and private effort to develop fuel cell technology 
platinum is the catalyst used in fuel cells to convert hydrogen and oxygen to electricity 
the lead fabricating segment was impacted by the price of lead 
prices for refined lead also began to drop in the second half of and continued to decline until year end  reflective of global demand that weakened during the same period 
the average north american producer and london metal exchange cash prices in september were nearly lower than they were at the beginning of use of lead worldwide was estimated to have increased by about in  driven primarily by strong economic growth in the information technology  telecommunications  and transportation sectors in china

table of contents the company does not carry  and does not expect to carry for the foreseeable future  significant insurance coverage for environmental liability other than conditions existing at the syracuse facility prior to its acquisition by the company because the company believes that the cost for such insurance is not economical

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   million of our outstanding debt consisted of variable rate borrowings million under our senior secured credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc and other lenders and million pursuant to a financing agreement with ableco finance  llc 
borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at either the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
the financing agreement with ableco provided for a minimum interest rate of on the outstanding balances 
any increase in either the prime rate or libor will increase interest expense 
we have entered into an interest rate swap contract which would mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate on million of the wells fargo foothill portion of the indebtedness 
assuming our variable borrowings were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year due to certain minimum interest rate terms on certain variable rate debt balances  with a corresponding change in cash flows 
commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for ferrous  non ferrous  pgm and lead metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and import and export markets can be volatile 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly instead of holding inventories in speculation of higher commodity prices 
we use forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to hedge against the extremely volatile pgm metal prices 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates
