competition st 
charles ameristar st 
charles competes with five other gaming operations located in the metropolitan st 
louis area 
two of these competitors are located in the state of illinois 
on november   missouri voters approved proposition a  which eliminated the buy in limit and the requirement for all guests to use a casino issued identification and tracking card to enter a casino 
proposition a also increased taxes on gross gaming receipts one percentage point to and placed a moratorium on the issuance of new gaming licenses except for one facility in south st 
louis county that was under construction at the time of passage of proposition a 
proposition a became effective immediately  and we implemented its operational enhancements on november  following receipt of regulatory approval 
the illinois casinos also do not have buy in limits or identification card requirements  and they allow credit play 
however  illinois casinos were included in an indoor smoking ban that became effective january   are limited in the number of gaming positions allowed and are subject to a higher rate of gaming taxes than missouri casinos 
at ameristar st 
charles  we substantially completed construction of the room  all suite hotel with an indoor outdoor pool and a  square foot  full service spa at the end of the second quarter of we believe our new hotel has helped counteract the negative impact of the increased competition described below  but the weak economy has constrained the short term growth we expected from it 
in december  a competitor opened an approximately million casino entertainment complex at laclede s landing in downtown st 
louis  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles 
the complex features a mix of restaurants  conference space and a  square foot casino 
the facility also includes hotel rooms that opened in february the same gaming company owns the other casino in downtown st 
louis 
long term plans for this casino have not yet been announced 
the downtown st 
louis gaming operator is also currently in the process of completing site work for a casino development project in lemay  which is located in the southeastern portion of st 
louis county  approximately miles from our st 
charles property 
the lemay project is expected to include a million hotel and casino entertainment complex and is currently slated for opening in early to mid we currently do not anticipate any new competition in the illinois portion of the st 
louis market 
however  increased competition for our st 
charles property would result if illinois law is changed in the future to allow the operation of slot machines at the existing pari mutuel racetrack near east st 
louis 
kansas city ameristar kansas city competes with three other gaming operations located in and around kansas city  missouri 
the kansas city market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles 
in  the kansas legislature enacted a law that authorizes up to four state owned and operated freestanding casinos and three racetrack slot machine parlors developed and managed by third parties 
one casino and one racetrack location are authorized in the greater kansas city market 
the successful bidder for the racetrack license recently surrendered its racing license due to concerns about the tax rate that would apply to its gaming operations  which was substantially higher than the tax rate in missouri or applicable to kansas freestanding casinos 
the future status of the racetrack license is uncertain 
in  several companies submitted applications to develop and manage the freestanding casino  and in september the kansas lottery commission selected a proposal by a consortium of developers to develop a large land based casino and entertainment facility at the kansas speedway  approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
the consortium subsequently withdrew this proposal due to issues regarding financial and project viability  and the kansas lottery commission has announced that it will be accepting new applications for the greater kansas city casino until april  it is unclear how many qualified bidders will emerge 
at this time  the previously successful applicant has announced plans to submit a bid for a significantly scaled down project 
if either or both of the new greater kansas city facilities open  we will face significant additional competition at ameristar kansas city that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of that property 
in january  a native american casino with bingo based class ii slot machines opened in kansas city  kansas 
the casino is located approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
however  we believe this casino has not materially adversely impacted the financial performance of ameristar kansas city 
council bluffs ameristar council bluffs operates one of three gaming licenses issued for the council bluffs gaming market pursuant to an operating agreement with iowa west racing association 
the two other competitors are operated by a single company and consist of another riverboat casino and a land based casino with a pari mutuel racetrack 
the council bluffs market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with the nearest competing gaming jurisdiction located approximately miles away 
in  a referendum on the statewide ballot that would have legalized video keno machines in nebraska was defeated  and another measure that would have legalized casino gaming in that state was ruled invalid by the nebraska supreme court 
in the future  the state of nebraska may again consider legalization of casino gaming which  if passed  would likely result in increased competition for ameristar council bluffs 
in december  the national indian gaming commission the nigc approved the request of the ponca tribe of nebraska to have a five acre parcel owned by the tribe in carter lake  iowa  located five miles from ameristar council bluffs  approved for the operation of gaming 
the nebraska attorney general filed an action in federal court challenging the nigc s decision  which was joined by the iowa attorney general and the city of council bluffs 
in december  a federal district court ruled that the tribe cannot build a casino at carter lake 
we believe it is likely the tribe will appeal 
if the tribe is successful in its appeal and is ultimately allowed to conduct gaming at this location  the additional competition would adversely affect our council bluffs business 
east chicago ameristar east chicago currently competes with eight other gaming operations in what is called the chicagoland gaming market  which includes casinos in illinois and michigan  as well as in northwest indiana 
these competitors are located within miles of east chicago 
illinois casinos are subject to higher gaming taxes than indiana casinos and also to gaming position limitations and a smoking ban 
located miles from downtown chicago  illinois  ameristar east chicago currently draws approximately of its guest base from illinois  with the remaining coming from northwest indiana and surrounding areas 
the core competitive market of northwest indiana is comprised of three casino operators  including ameristar  located in east chicago  hammond and gary  indiana 
the northwest indiana operators are located within five miles of each other on lake michigan 
in july  the operator in hammond  indiana completed its million new vessel project  which significantly expanded the size of its casino and other operations 
additionally  an operator in michigan city  indiana  located approximately miles from east chicago  opened a million hotel complex in january ameristar purchased the resorts east chicago property in september and rebranded it as an ameristar property in june during  ameristar spent approximately million on capital improvements  property refurbishments and other rebranding costs 
in december  the illinois gaming board awarded the remaining dormant gaming license for a proposed casino entertainment complex in des plaines  illinois  which is approximately miles northwest of east chicago  indiana 
pending legislative and background approvals  permitting and construction timelines  we believe the earliest casino operations would commence is in future legislation regarding the possible expansion of gaming in illinois may be considered by illinois lawmakers 
if enacted  this legislation could lead to a significant level of additional competition in the chicagoland market 
vicksburg ameristar vicksburg currently competes with four other gaming operations located in vicksburg  mississippi 
vicksburg is located approximately miles west of mississippi s largest city  jackson 
in may  ameristar completed a casino expansion that added  square feet of gaming space and a new  space parking garage 
the vicksburg expansion also included a new vip lounge that opened in july and two additional restaurants  which opened in september 
in october  a new competitor opened a million casino hotel in vicksburg 
the new facility has a  square foot casino and hotel rooms  and is located two miles from ameristar vicksburg 
the additional competition has impacted the financial performance of our property and the other facilities operating in the market 
several potential gaming sites still exist in or near vicksburg and from time to time potential competitors have proposed the development of additional casinos 
in  the mississippi gaming commission granted preliminary approval for the sixth casino license in the vicksburg market 
one developer has proposed building a million casino facility that would include a room hotel  parking garage and other non gaming amenities 
as originally announced  construction of this project was to begin in early the announced commencement date was subsequently changed to late  but development has not yet begun  and no new date has been announced 
in addition  proposals have been made from time to time to develop other native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market if completed 
the vicksburg market also faces regional competition from two casinos owned by a native american tribe in philadelphia  mississippi  located about miles east of jackson and miles east of vicksburg 
vicksburg is also subject to competition from four casinos and one slots only racetrack in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana  located approximately miles from vicksburg  as well as casinos located along the mississippi gulf coast 
black hawk ameristar black hawk competes with other gaming operations located in the black hawk and central city gaming markets in colorado 
ameristar has the largest single gaming floor and parking garage of any casino in the black hawk and central city markets 
of the other casinos in the market  only five are considered large competitors  with over slot machines 
ameristar s primary competitor is one of the first major casinos encountered when entering black hawk from denver via route this competitor s primary casino is connected via a skywalk to an adjacent casino the operator also owns  thereby offering increased availability of hotel rooms  parking capacity and gaming positions to guests 
in january  a statewide smoking ban in colorado was extended to include casino floors 
in november  colorado voters approved amendment  which gave local gaming jurisdictions the option of increasing bet limits  expanding permitted table games and increasing the hours of operation 
on january   voters in the city of black hawk approved the local referendum to increase bet limits from to  add craps and roulette and expand operating hours from hours daily to up to hours daily 
these changes are scheduled to become effective july  during  ameristar made substantial progress and remains on schedule to complete its hotel 
the room hotel tower is scheduled to open in the early fall of at a cost of approximately million and will double the room capacity in the black hawk market 
there were no other substantial capital investments by the large competitors during the black hawk and central city gaming markets are currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competing markets within miles 
however  there have been several proposals for the development of a native american casino located in the denver metropolitan area 
in addition  there was an unsuccessful attempt to place a proposal on the november ballot authorizing racetrack casino operations in the denver area 
at this time it is unclear whether a similar proposal will be included on future ballots 
both native american and racetrack gaming have been defeated in past ballot initiatives 
should additional gaming developments occur in the denver metropolitan area  the black hawk and central city markets would face increased competition 
jackpot the jackpot properties compete with three other hotels and motels all of which also have casinos in jackpot and a native american casino near pocatello  idaho 
the native american casino operates video lottery terminals  which are similar to slot machines 
in may  cactus petes completed a million refurbishment of its hotel rooms 
there were no major capital improvements or expansions by competitors in the jackpot market in we are not aware of any other current expansion plans by existing or potential competitors in jackpot 
other in addition to the competition that our properties face from other casinos in their geographic markets  we also compete  to a lesser extent  with casinos in other locations  including major tourist destinations such as las vegas  with gaming on cruise ships and with other forms of gaming in the united states  including state sponsored lotteries  racetracks  off track wagering  internet and other account wagering and card parlors 
employees and labor relations as of march   we employed approximately  full and part time employees 
approximately employees at our east chicago property are employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe our employee relations are good 
incorporation ameristar was incorporated in nevada in government regulation the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
we are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming 
the limitation  conditioning or suspension of gaming licenses could and the revocation or non renewal of gaming licenses would materially adversely affect our operations in that jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in law that restrict or prohibit our gaming operations in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on us 
missouri the ownership and operation of riverboat and dockside gaming facilities in missouri are subject to extensive state and local regulation  but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the missouri gaming commission 
the missouri riverboat gaming act the missouri act provides for the licensing and regulation of riverboat and dockside gaming operations on the mississippi and missouri rivers in the state of missouri and the licensing and regulation of persons who distribute gaming equipment and supplies to gaming licensees 
the missouri gaming commission has discretion to approve gaming license applications for permanently moored dockside casinos  powered excursion riverboat casinos and barges and to determine the type of excursion gambling boats allowed each licensee 
pursuant to the november  passage of the schools first initiative proposition a  the total number of excursion gambling boat licenses may not exceed due to safety concerns  all gaming vessels on the missouri river are permitted to be moored in moats within  feet of the river 
gaming licenses are initially issued for two one year periods and must be renewed every two years thereafter 
the gaming licenses at ameristar kansas city and ameristar st 
charles are next subject to renewal in october no gaming licensee may pledge or transfer in any way any license  or any interest in a license  issued by the missouri gaming commission 
as a result  the gaming licenses of our wholly owned missouri subsidiaries were not pledged to secure our senior credit facilities

risk factors our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 
our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the economic recession currently being experienced in the united states  as we are highly dependent on discretionary spending by our guests 
we are not able to predict the length or severity of the recession 
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased unemployment  significant increases in energy prices such as occurred in the first half of  perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions  the current housing crisis  the current credit crisis  bank failures and the potential for additional bank failures  perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth  the current global economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy may continue to reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and adversely affect our revenues and cash flow 
we have substantial debt that may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations 
we currently have a substantial amount of debt 
as of december   our total consolidated debt was billion 
under our senior credit facilities  giving effect to an amendment we entered into in march  we are currently required to maintain a senior leverage ratio  calculated as senior debt divided by our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense as defined in the senior credit facilities ebitda  of no more than the required senior leverage ratio declines to at june  and declines further thereafter 
as of december   our senior leverage ratio was our outstanding debt and any additional debt we may incur in the future could have important adverse consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions  particularly when the availability of acceptable financing in the capital markets is limited as is now the case  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of interest and principal on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  stock repurchases and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
covenant restrictions under our senior credit facilities may limit our ability to operate our business 
the agreement governing our senior credit facilities contains covenants that may restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities are subject to various exceptions that are intended to allow us to operate without undue restraint in certain anticipated circumstances  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash  and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund capital expenditures and other corporate requirements depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
to some extent  this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  the ability to borrow funds under our senior credit facilities in the future will depend on our satisfying the financial covenants in the agreement governing such facilities 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
as a result  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
our revolving loan facility matures in and our term loan facility matures in we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on acceptable terms 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
conditions in the financial system and the capital and credit markets may negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the current crisis in the banking system and financial markets has resulted in a severe tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and other adverse conditions for issuers in fixed income and equity markets 
within the past year  these markets have experienced disruption that has had a dramatic impact on the availability and cost of capital and credit 
the market interest rate for debt of companies similar to us has increased substantially in the past several months 
while the united states and other governments have enacted legislation and taken other actions to help alleviate these conditions  there is no assurance that such steps will have the effect of easing the conditions in credit and capital markets 
therefore  we have no assurance that we will have further access to credit or capital markets at desirable times or at rates that we would consider acceptable  and the lack of such funding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are unable to predict the duration or severity of the current disruption in the capital and credit markets  or its further impact on the larger economy 
we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates 
substantially all of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates  although we have entered into interest rate protection agreements expiring in july with counterparty banks with respect to a majority of our senior debt 
if short term interest rates rise  our interest cost will increase  which will adversely affect our net income and available cash 
the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive and we face dynamic competitive pressures in each of our markets 
several of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
we may choose or be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain guests 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments  as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity  could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 
in  the kansas legislature enacted a law that authorizes up to four state owned and operated freestanding casinos and three racetrack slot machine parlors developed and managed by third parties 
one casino and one racetrack location are authorized in the greater kansas city market 
the successful bidder for the racetrack license recently surrendered its racing license due to concerns about the tax rate that would apply to its gaming operations  which was substantially higher than the tax rate in missouri or applicable to kansas freestanding casinos 
the future status of the racetrack license is uncertain 
in  several companies submitted applications to develop and manage the freestanding casino  and in september the kansas lottery commission selected a proposal by a consortium of developers to develop a large land based casino and entertainment facility at the kansas speedway  approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
the consortium subsequently withdrew this proposal due to issues regarding financial and project viability  and the kansas lottery commission has announced that it will be accepting new applications for the greater kansas city casino until april  it is unclear how many qualified bidders will emerge 
at this time  the previously successful applicant has announced plans to submit a bid for a significantly scaled down project 
if either or both of the new greater kansas city facilities open  we will face significant additional competition at ameristar kansas city that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of that property 
our east chicago property currently competes with seven other casino gaming facilities in the chicagoland market in indiana and illinois  and with one native american casino in michigan 
the property s principal competitor is located in hammond  indiana  which is closer to and has better access for guests who live in chicago  illinois and the chicago suburbs that are the primary feeder markets for ameristar east chicago 
the hammond facility opened a million expansion in july that has adversely affected our property s business  particularly table games and poker  and we expect will continue to do so 
in december  the illinois gaming board awarded the dormant tenth illinois gaming license to a developer for a property in des plaines  illinois  located approximately miles from ameristar east chicago 
from time to time  the illinois legislature has also considered other forms of gaming expansion in the state  including a land based casino in the city of chicago  new riverboat casinos  the authorization of slot machines at the existing racetracks and an increase in the number of authorized gaming positions at each of the existing illinois casinos which are currently limited to  positions 
if the des plaines facility is developed or illinois otherwise materially expands gaming  particularly in downtown chicago or the south chicago suburbs  the additional competition could materially adversely affect the financial performance of ameristar east chicago 
in december  a competitor opened a new casino hotel in downtown st 
louis  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles  and the same competitor is currently developing a second casino facility in southeastern st 
louis county  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles 
the southeastern st 
louis county facility is expected to open in early to mid the same operator owns an operating casino in downtown st 
louis that it has indicated it may seek to move to another location in the st 
louis market 
the new gaming facility in downtown st 
louis has resulted in significant additional competition for ameristar st 
charles  and the casino under construction in southeastern st 
louis county is also expected to impact ameristar st 
charles business 
in addition  if legislation is enacted in illinois to permit the operation of slot machines at racetracks  ameristar st 
charles would face additional competition from the racetrack near east st 
louis  illinois 
in vicksburg  a new million casino hotel opened in october the additional competition has adversely affected the financial results of the other casinos in the market  including ameristar vicksburg 
additionally  in  a million casino development project in vicksburg received preliminary approval from the mississippi gaming commission  but it is not currently known if or when this development will occur 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
in december  the nigc approved the request of the ponca tribe of nebraska to have a five acre parcel owned by the tribe in carter lake  iowa  located five miles from ameristar council bluffs  approved for the operation of gaming 
in december  in a lawsuit brought by the state of nebraska and joined by the state of iowa and the city of council bluffs  the federal district court reversed the nigc s decision 
we believe it is likely the tribe will file an appeal 
if the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location  the additional competition would adversely affect our council bluffs business 
the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering and gaming services  which allow guests to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
our business has been and may be further adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking 
legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has recently been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions  including many of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
effective january   a colorado statewide smoking ban was extended to include casino floors 
we believe this ban has significantly reduced business volumes in all colorado gaming markets 
in april  voters in the city of kansas city  missouri approved a ballot measure  which was subsequently modified by the city council  that prohibits smoking in most indoor public places within the city  including restaurants  but which contains an exemption for casino floors and of all hotel rooms 
one of ameristar kansas city s competitors is not subject to a smoking ban in any form  which we believe has had a negative impact on our business 
on july   a statewide indoor smoking ban went into effect in the state of iowa 
the law includes an exemption for casino floors and of all hotel rooms 
several bills have been introduced in the iowa general assembly that would either remove the casino floor exemption or further prohibit smoking in indoor public places 
similar bills have been introduced in the indiana and missouri general assemblies 
if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate  particularly if such restrictions are applicable to casino floors  our business could be materially adversely affected 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits  such as are currently being experienced in many states  may intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to further increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the buy in limit in missouri that became effective in november  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  indiana  mississippi  colorado and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the indiana gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission  the colorado limited gaming control commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  indiana  mississippi  colorado or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our gaming licenses in missouri must be renewed every two years  our gaming licenses in iowa  indiana and colorado must be renewed or continued every year  and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that our existing licenses  permits and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure you that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  hurricanes  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  delays or increased costs in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently engaged in litigation with the general contractor for our st 
charles hotel project  which was completed later and at a higher cost than originally announced 
from time to time  we may employ fast track design and construction methods in our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe the use of fast track design and construction methods may reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  often involve greater construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facilities at any time will be dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our ebitda during the preceding four full fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete current or future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
we have limited opportunities to develop new properties 
the casino gaming industry has limited new development opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially acceptable 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities that do arise  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources and name recognition than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business through new development 
the estate of craig h 
neilsen owns a majority of our common stock and may have interests that differ from those of other holders of our common stock 
craig h 
neilsen  our founder and former chairman of the board and chief executive officer  died in november at the time of his death  mr 
neilsen beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of his death  these shares passed by operation of law to mr 
neilsen s estate the estate 
the co executors of the estate are ray h 
neilsen  our chairman of the board  and gordon r 
kanofsky  our chief executive officer and vice chairman of the board 
craig h 
neilsen s estate plan provides that  shares of our common stock owned by the estate or approximately of our shares currently outstanding will ultimately pass to the craig h 
neilsen foundation  a private foundation primarily focused on funding spinal cord injury research and treatment the foundation 
messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky serve as the co trustees of the foundation  and they also serve on the foundation s five person board of directors 
as officers and directors of aci  executors of the estate and trustees and directors of the foundation  messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky may be subject to certain conflicts of interest 
in light of their control over a majority of our common stock  messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky jointly have the ability to elect the entire board of directors over time and  except as otherwise provided by law or our articles of incorporation  to approve or disapprove other matters that may be submitted to a vote of the stockholders 
as a result  actions requiring stockholder approval that may be supported by a majority of the other stockholders  including a merger or sale of our assets or the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of common stock to finance acquisitions or other growth opportunities  could be blocked by messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky 
in addition  the estate s ownership affects the liquidity in the market for our common stock and sales by the estate could affect the price of our common stock 
messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky  as co executors of the estate  disclosed in a schedule d amendment filed with the securities and exchange commission in october that  on behalf of the estate  they will continue to review the estate s liquidity needs and other factors impacting the estate s investment in our common stock and may evaluate strategic alternatives to the estate s holdings in the company  including possible sales of some or all of our common stock held by the estate or one or more transactions that could influence or change control of the company 
some of the factors influencing the estate s investment decisions with respect to our common stock may not be relevant to other holders of our common stock 
our ability to pay dividends is dependent on a number of factors and is not assured 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
from until the fourth quarter of  we had paid consecutive quarterly dividends  but due to the adverse conditions in the credit markets and general economic deterioration  the board of directors did not declare a dividend during the fourth quarter of the payment of future dividends will depend upon our earnings  economic conditions  liquidity and capital requirements and other factors 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that future dividends will be paid or will be paid at levels that equal or exceed our historical distributions 
in addition  our senior credit facilities impose limitations on the amount of dividends we may pay  and the terms of future indebtedness may impose limitations on our ability to pay dividends determined by one or more of the amount of dividends  the satisfaction of certain financial covenants or other conditions 
a change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations 
certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities 
this acceleration could be triggered in the event the estate or its beneficiaries  including the foundation  sells a substantial number of shares of our common stock  which they might have to do in order to pay estate tax liabilities or satisfy legal requirements applicable to shareholdings by private foundations 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay or refinance any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act or threat of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the travel and tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
our business may be adversely affected by our ability to retain and attract key personnel 
we depend on the continued performance of our entire senior executive team 
if we lose the services of any of our key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel  including competition from numerous native american gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation 
from time to time  we have a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
as we recruit personnel  we expect successful candidates to exhibit a collaborative  communicative and collegial nature 
we also employ a high degree of centralization in a highly decentralized industry 
we use multi faceted recruitment  assessment and interviewing approaches that include several levels of interactions and interviews over a period of time 
these factors create risk in attracting management personnel in a timely fashion  as well as hiring candidates we expect to be successful in our company 
adverse weather conditions or natural disasters in the areas in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  as well as natural disasters  can deter our guests from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if multiple properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we have very limited insurance coverage for earthquake damage at our properties 
several of our properties  particularly ameristar st 
charles  are located near historically active earthquake faults 
in the event one of our properties were to sustain significant damage from an earthquake  our business could be materially adversely affected 
the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry could impose additional costs on us 
the majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines operated by us at our casinos 
it is important  for competitive reasons  that we offer the most popular and up to date slot machine games with the latest technology to our guests 
we believe that a substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the us in were manufactured by a few companies 
in addition  we believe that one company in particular provided a majority of all slot machines sold in the us in in recent years  the prices of new slot machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation 
furthermore  in recent years  slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games  instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines 
participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental 
such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin in or net win 
generally  a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine 
for competitive reasons  we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than our costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines 
if the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participating lease costs  it could hurt our profitability 
any loss from service of our riverboat and barge facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our riverboat and barge facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel is dry docked on a concrete foundation  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site to evaluate what further steps may be necessary to stabilize the site to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of a riverboat or barge facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our long term debt facilities in an amount that we are unable to reasonably estimate 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our senior credit facilities 
we are subject to non gaming regulation 
we are subject to certain federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and ordinances that apply to non gaming businesses generally  including the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of under various federal  state and local laws and regulations  an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property  regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of  or is responsible for  the presence of such substances or wastes 
we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations 
however  certain of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years 
as a consequence  it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that  as a result  environmental issues could arise in the future  the precise nature of which we cannot now predict 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events has significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities 
regulations adopted by the financial crimes enforcement network of the us treasury department require us to report currency transactions in excess of  occurring within a gaming day  including identification of the patron by name and social security number 
us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity  including any transaction that exceeds  if we know  suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements 
substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations 
our casino riverboat and barge vessels must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
in addition  we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity 
our casino barges also must meet local fire safety standards 
we would incur additional costs if any of our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations 
we are also subject to a variety of other federal  state and local laws and regulations  including those relating to zoning  construction  land use  employment  advertising and the sale of alcoholic beverages 
if we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the imposition of a substantial penalty or the loss of service of a gaming facility for a significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business

item legal proceedings st 
charles hotel project construction litigation 
in november  acsci entered into a contract the contract with walton construction company  llc walton  pursuant to which walton was to provide general contracting and construction management services for the construction of the suite hotel and related amenities at ameristar st 
charles 
the contract provides for payment of the actual cost of the work subject to a guaranteed maximum price gmp 
the original contract completion date was november  and that date was extended to december  by written amendment in march while we were able to open the hotel facility in stages as it was being completed in the first half of in order to mitigate damages from the delay  the project was not substantially completed until june after the march amendment  walton asserted various claims for additional compensation  in excess of the agreed upon gmp  based on alleged changes to the contract scope of work and asserted delays and other impacts to the completion of the project 
we reviewed and rejected many of these claims  but did accept others and issued appropriate change orders to walton 
the current gmp  as agreed to by us  is slightly less than million 
on june   walton filed a mechanic s lien against the st 
charles property 
in addition  on that same day  walton filed suit in the circuit court of st 
charles county  missouri seeking recovery of the amounts included in its mechanic s lien 
walton also has sought interest on unpaid amounts pursuant to the missouri prompt pay act  which imposes per month interest on amounts that are not paid pursuant to the terms of an enforceable contract and permits recovery of attorneys fees by the prevailing party in the dispute 
walton s lawsuit and lien essentially claim that the gmp ought to be increased to approximately million  with the increase representing certain amounts allegedly due to subcontractors for work performed as well as amounts claimed by walton for its own management  supervision and general conditions 
since the filing of the lien and lawsuit  we have been working to resolve the various claims for subcontractor work directly with the affected subcontractors 
we currently expect that these efforts will result in our making a total contract expenditure inclusive of amounts previously paid to walton pursuant to the gmp and amounts paid directly to subcontractors of approximately million 
we believe that the additional amounts claimed by walton in its lawsuit approximately million primarily relate to the claims that walton has asserted for its own extended general conditions  added contingency and other costs for its own account 
all those claims will remain disputed and contested by ameristar 
we have also filed a counterclaim against walton seeking damages in excess of million based on the delay in completion of the project and defective and deficient work by walton 
we intend to vigorously defend against walton s claims and assert our own claims 
the litigation is currently in the discovery stage 
in addition to walton s mechanic s lien  certain subcontractors to walton have filed mechanic s liens against the st 
charles property  and some also filed suit to foreclose on such liens 
as we settle claims directly with various subcontractors  we expect that a number of these liens and lawsuits will be dismissed 
east chicago local development agreement litigation 
in  showboat casino marina partnership showboat  the original owner of our east chicago casino property  entered into a local development agreement the lda  agreeing to pay of its adjusted gross receipts agr for local economic development purposes 
the payments were to be made a to the city of east chicago the city  b each to two separate community non profit foundations  which subsequently merged with each other the foundation  and c to east chicago second century  inc  a for profit indiana corporation formed by showboat to pursue local economic development second century 
in  showboat sold the property to an affiliate of harrah s entertainment  inc harrah s 
during the entire period that showboat and harrah s owned the property  they paid of their agr to these entities 
in april  rih acquisitions in  llc rih now known as ameristar casino east chicago  llc purchased the property from harrah s 
shortly before that time  the city began to assert a right to all of the lda funds 
in june  the indiana gaming commission the igc adopted a resolution disapproving of that portion of the lda requiring the casino licensee to make any payments to second century due to its concerns with the individuals owning and controlling second century  who were associates of the former mayor of the city 
the resolution directed rih to propose to the igc a plan of action for how rih would continue making the lda payments in light of the igc s decision disapproving of the payments to second century and the competing and irreconcilable claims of second century and the city to those funds 
to comply with the resolution  on june   rih filed a proposed plan of action with the igc 
among other things  rih proposed that it would pay the of agr payments earmarked for second century into a separate interest bearing bank account and hold those funds and the interest thereon in the account until a court of competent jurisdiction ordered otherwise 
the igc did not take further action on the plan of action  and on june   rih started making these payments to the separate account 
after we acquired rih on september   in accordance with the purchase agreement  rih opened a new separate interest bearing bank account under our federal tax identification number and transferred the entire balance in the former separate account to this new account 
rih has continued to deposit of its agr into this account 
as of february   this account had a balance of approximately million 
in april  the indiana legislature enacted a bill  which was signed into law by the governor  permitting the common council of the city  upon transfer of the controlling interest in the east chicago casino license  to adopt an ordinance voiding any term of the lda and allowing for any payment of funds under the lda to be redirected to the city 
the common council of the city adopted an ordinance in october voiding those terms of the lda that provide for payment of lda funds to second century and adopted a similar ordinance that applies to the foundation funds 
these ordinances purport to redirect the payment of all lda funds to the city  including the funds held by rih in the separate bank account 
on june   prior to the closing of our acquisition of rih  second century filed a complaint against aci and rih in superior court of marion county  indiana 
the complaint alleges that rih s action to stop making lda payments to second century and instead make the payments to the separate bank account was a breach of the lda  conversion  criminal conversion and constructive fraud 
second century is seeking to recover an amount equal to the of agr payments it claims should have been made to it since june   compensatory damages  treble damages under indiana s crime victims statute and its attorneys fees  and is also seeking a declaration from the court that aci is now bound by the lda and is required to pay of rih s agr to second century 
in december  the court issued an order requiring rih to continue paying the of agr payments to the separate bank account and to hold all the funds in that account until it or another court of competent jurisdiction orders otherwise 
second century moved for partial summary judgment against rih  seeking rulings that rih is in breach of the lda and that its failure to pay the lda funds to second century amounts to criminal conversion which would entitle second century to treble damages and its attorneys fees 
in january  aci and rih filed a response opposing the motion for summary judgment and seeking summary judgment in favor of rih on both the contract and conversion claims 
the city also filed a brief in opposition to second century s motion for partial summary judgment 
on september   the court issued an amended order granting summary judgment in favor of aci and rih and denying summary judgment in favor of second century on second century s conversion claim 
the court denied each party s motion for summary judgment on second century s breach of contract claim 
the court entered a final judgment on the conversion claim on october  second century filed a motion to reconsider the court s order directing entry of final judgment  which the court denied on january  we have not taken a position on the merits of the other parties disputes over the lda funds  and have stated that we are committed to continue paying the of agr for local economic development purposes  unless a court of competent jurisdiction orders otherwise 
we intend to comply with the court s order requiring rih to hold the second century lda funds in the separate account  and another marion county superior court s order entered in december requiring rih to hold the foundation lda funds in a different segregated bank account  and to vigorously contest any claims against us seeking money beyond our stated commitment to pay of rih s agr for local economic development purposes 
east chicago property tax litigation 
on april   aci and its wholly owned subsidiary  ameristar east chicago holdings  llc aech  filed a complaint for fraud  equitable fraud  breach of contract  intentional breach of contract and indemnity against resorts international holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company resorts  in the delaware court of chancery 
the complaint alleges that resorts intentionally misrepresented and concealed from aci and aech that resorts had received notice of an unexpected increase in the tax assessor s assessed value of the resorts east chicago real property improvements for after aci had entered into the purchase agreement with resorts to acquire the ownership interest in resorts east chicago and prior to the closing of the acquisition 
the complaint further alleges that  knowing the property tax liability relating to the real property improvements would likewise increase dramatically  resorts kept this information secret from aci and aech  thereby breaching representations  warranties and covenants in the purchase agreement 
the complaint seeks damages in an amount to be established at trial and other relief 
the litigation is currently in the discovery stage

risk factors 
overview we develop  own and operate casinos and related hotel  food and beverage  entertainment and other facilities  with eight properties in operation in missouri  iowa  indiana  mississippi  colorado and nevada 
our portfolio of casinos consists of ameristar casino resort spa st 
charles serving greater st 
louis  missouri  ameristar casino hotel kansas city serving the kansas city metropolitan area  ameristar casino hotel council bluffs serving omaha  nebraska and southwestern iowa  ameristar casino hotel east chicago serving the chicagoland area  ameristar vicksburg serving jackson  mississippi and monroe  louisiana  ameristar casino black hawk serving the denver  colorado metropolitan area  and cactus petes and the horseshu in jackpot  nevada serving idaho and the pacific northwest 
we acquired ameristar east chicago formerly resorts east chicago on september   and its operating results are included only from the acquisition date 
our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those patrons spend per visit 
management uses various metrics to evaluate these factors 
key metrics include slots handle table games drop measurements of gaming volume  win hold percentages the percentage of handle or drop that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue  hotel occupancy rate the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  average daily room rate the average price of occupied hotel rooms per day  revpar the revenue per available room is a summary measure of hotel results that combines average daily room rate and hotel occupancy rate  market share the share of gross gaming revenues in each of our markets other than jackpot and our share of gaming devices in the jackpot market nevada does not publish separate gaming revenue statistics for this market  fair share percentage a percentage of gross gaming revenues based on the number of gaming positions relative to the total gaming positions in the market  and win per patron the amount of gaming revenues generated per patron who enters our casinos in jurisdictions that record this information 
our operating results may be affected by  among other things  competitive factors  gaming tax increases  the commencement of new gaming operations  charges associated with debt refinancing or property acquisition and disposition transactions  construction at existing facilities  general public sentiment regarding travel  overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our patrons and weather conditions affecting our properties 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality and other factors 
historically  our fourth quarter is weaker than other periods due mostly to the combined effects of inclement weather and guest visitation and spending patterns between the thanksgiving and christmas holidays 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods results 
the following significant factors and trends should be considered in analyzing our operating performance general economic conditions  colorado smoking ban impact 
the economic recession continues to adversely impact the gaming industry and our company 
we believe our guests have reduced their discretionary spending as a result of uncertainty and instability relating to employment and the credit  investment and housing markets 
on a same store basis ie  excluding ameristar east chicago  our consolidated net revenues and operating income for the year ended december  declined and  respectively  from the prior year 
in addition  high fuel costs earlier in appeared to deter potential guests from traveling  especially within our more geographically dispersed markets 
for the year ended december   gross gaming revenues for the black hawk  jackpot and vicksburg markets contracted  and  respectively  when compared to in addition to the general downturn in the economy and increased fuel prices  we believe the black hawk market was materially negatively affected by a statewide smoking ban that became effective for casinos on january  missouri and colorado regulatory reforms 
on november   voters in missouri and colorado approved ballot initiatives that are expected to favorably impact ameristar properties in those states 
in missouri  voters approved proposition a  which eliminated the buy in limit and the requirement for all casino guests to use player identification and tracking cards 
proposition a also raised taxes on gross gaming receipts from to and placed a moratorium on the issuance of new gaming licenses except for one facility in south st 
louis county that was under construction at the time of the passage of proposition a 
proposition a became effective immediately  and we implemented its operational enhancements on november  following receipt of regulatory approval 
in colorado  voters approved amendment  which authorized each of the three towns in colorado in which casinos operate to hold a local referendum asking voters to allow casinos to extend hours of operation from hours daily to up to hours daily  increase bet limits from to up to and add roulette and craps 
the measure also provides that gaming tax rates can be raised only after a statewide voter referendum  as is required to increase other taxes in colorado 
in january  the city of black hawk passed the local referendum  and the provisions of amendment will go into effect on july  we believe these regulatory changes will allow us to more effectively market our properties to all guests 
during the year ended december   ballot initiative costs for missouri and colorado totaled million and million  respectively 
cost efficiencies 
in august  we began to implement a strategic plan to improve efficiencies and reduce our cost structure as weak economic conditions continued to adversely impact business volumes 
as part of this plan  we reduced our workforce costs through position eliminations  adjusting staffing practices and attrition 
we also restructured the organization of our property and corporate management teams to be more efficient and streamlined 
actions taken to date are expected to produce annualized savings of approximately million 
for the year ended december   severance charges increased million over the prior year mostly as a result of the workforce reductions that occurred in the latter part of our strategic plan includes the continuous review of our operations  including exploring ways we can operate more efficiently and decrease our costs to enhance margins 
ameristar east chicago intangible asset impairment 
in  we recorded a total of million million on an after tax basis in non cash impairment charges relating to the goodwill and gaming license acquired in the purchase of ameristar east chicago 
the reduction in the value of these intangible assets was attributable to the significant deterioration of the debt and equity capital markets  as well as a lowering of our growth assumptions for the property to reflect its current operating performance relative to our assumptions at the time of acquisition and the decline in general economic conditions 
promotional spending 
financial results for the second and third quarters of were adversely impacted by a significant increase in promotional spending 
during the third quarter of  same store promotional allowances increased over the prior year third quarter as a result of an aggressive companywide marketing program designed to capture profitable incremental revenue and our efforts to introduce gaming guests to the new hotel and spa in st 
charles mentioned below 
the marketing program to capture profitable incremental revenue was ineffective in the current economic environment  and as a result we began to curtail promotional spending commencing in the third quarter 
we had more significant reductions in the fourth quarter of as promotional spending decreased million from the third quarter of ameristar st 
charles 
the st 
charles property s annual net revenues increased million over the net revenues  primarily as a result of the new hotel  offset by weakening economic conditions 
however  operating income decreased million from the prior year due to the higher costs associated with operating the hotel and related amenities  increased depreciation expense and the increased competition from a new casino hotel that opened in the market in the fourth quarter of we believe our new hotel has helped counteract the negative impact of the increased competition  but the weak economy has constrained the short term growth we expected from it 
ameristar vicksburg 
we substantially completed the casino expansion and the new  space parking garage at our vicksburg property in may since the opening of the garage and casino expansion  a new vip lounge was completed in july and two additional restaurants were opened in september 
as a result of these projects  we further strengthened our dominant market share position 
however  on october   a new competitor opened a million casino hotel in vicksburg 
the additional competition has adversely affected the financial performance of ameristar vicksburg and the other facilities operating in the market 
our market share declined percentage points  from in the third quarter of to in the fourth quarter 
in  our fourth quarter market share was 
ameristar east chicago 
we rebranded our east chicago property to ameristar in june  following the completion of a number of enhancements to the property 
the total cost of the rebranding renovations and related promotional and other expenses was approximately million  of which approximately million was expensed in our market share was negatively impacted by the opening of a million expansion of our primary competitor in july debt and interest expense 
at december  and  total debt was billion 
net borrowings totaled million during the year ended december  to date in  we have borrowed an additional million under our revolving loan facility 
in march  we amended our senior credit facilities to increase the maximum permitted leverage ratio and senior leverage ratio both as defined in the senior credit facilities for our fiscal quarters ending on and after march  during  net interest expense increased from  due primarily to a higher debt balance following our financing of the ameristar east chicago acquisition and the cessation of interest capitalization associated with the st 
charles hotel and vicksburg expansion projects 
effective july   we entered into a two year interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank to add stability to interest expense and manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap effectively fixes the annual interest rate on million of libor based borrowings under our senior revolving loan facility at plus the applicable margin  which is currently 
on october   we entered into a similar interest rate swap transaction with another commercial bank that effectively fixes the annual interest rate on an additional million of our revolving debt at plus the applicable margin 
this swap transaction has an effective date of october  and terminates on july  we now have billion of our variable rate debt hedged until july at a weighted average fixed rate of plus the applicable margin 
the march amendment to our senior credit facilities increased our interest rate add on by basis points 
accordingly  we expect a significant increase in interest expense in compared to for more information on the march amendments to our senior credit facilities  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements

net income for the years ended december  and  we reported a net loss of million and net income of million  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to the million east chicago impairment charges and the declines in same store revenues and operating margins as discussed above

in  slot revenues increased million at the jackpot properties and our black hawk property benefited from a full year of operating results following its april rebranding 
in addition  the black hawk property benefited from reduced construction disruption following the completion of the initial phase of our expansion activities in the first quarter of the increases were partially offset by decreases from net revenues at our vicksburg  council bluffs and kansas city properties 
ameristar vicksburg s decline in net revenues was mostly attributable to the business recapture by the gulf coast casinos that continued throughout  significant construction related disruption at the property and general economic weakness in the region

accordingly  operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income 
the increase in operating cash flows from to was mostly attributable to ameristar east chicago  which we owned for a full year in  compared to only days during the increase in operating cash flows from to was mostly attributable to contributions to consolidated operating income by our east chicago and black hawk properties and positive changes in several of our working capital assets and liabilities 
for each of the years ended december   and  capital expenditures were primarily related to our expansion at ameristar st 
charles  ameristar black hawk capital improvement projects  our expansion at ameristar vicksburg and the acquisition of slot machines

at ameristar st 
charles  we substantially completed construction of the room  all suite hotel with an indoor outdoor pool and a  square foot  full service spa at the end of the second quarter of we substantially completed the million expansion and the new  space parking garage at our vicksburg property in may since the opening of the garage and casino expansion  a new vip lounge was completed in july and two additional restaurants opened in september 
a renovation of the cactus petes hotel was completed in may at a cost of approximately million 
for the years ended december   and  cash flows used in  or provided by  financing activities were impacted by debt borrowings  principal payments on long term debt  dividend payments  proceeds from employee stock option exercises and purchases of treasury stock 
financing cash flows during were impacted by the february  redemption of our senior subordinated notes with borrowings under our revolving loan facility 
in  our board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of per share on our common stock 
during the years ended december  and  we paid four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share and per share  respectively 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
for the year ended december   we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
liquidity our debt structure primarily consists of a billion senior credit facility that includes a billion revolving loan facility maturing in november and a million term loan facility maturing in november as of december   the principal debt outstanding under the senior credit facility consisted of billion under the revolving loan facility and million under the term loan facility 
at december   the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was million after giving effect to million of outstanding letters of credit 
all mandatory principal repayments have been made through december  to date in  we have borrowed an additional million under our revolving loan facility 
the agreement governing the senior credit facilities requires us to comply with various affirmative and negative financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  restrictions on dividend payments and other restrictions and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and tests 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
on march   we amended our senior credit facilities to increase the maximum permitted leverage and senior leverage ratios both as defined in the senior credit facilities 
increases of to were made to the maximum permitted leverage ratio for each of our fiscal quarters ending on and after september   and increases of to were made to the maximum permitted senior leverage ratio for each of our fiscal quarters ending on and after march  after giving effect to the amendment  the maximum permitted senior leverage ratio increased from at december  to at march   and it remains at that level through march  additionally  the amendment increased the interest rate add on for all revolving and term loan borrowings under the senior credit facilities by basis points  reduced permitted annual dividends from million to million beginning with the year ending december   with any unused portion of such amount permitted to be carried over to future years  increased the aggregate limit on capital expenditures by million  and decreased the permitted amount of cumulative stock repurchases from million to million in addition to any amount available under the dividend basket 
the amendment also eliminated the million limit on the future issuance of subordinated debt and also permits us to issue an unlimited amount of senior unsecured debt 
we believe the amendment was important to avoid potentially violating the senior leverage ratio covenant in the second half of  when the maximum permitted ratio would have declined to under the previous terms of the senior credit facilities 
the amendment provides us significant relief under the leverage and senior leverage ratios for the foreseeable future thereby improving our borrowing flexibility related to our current available funds under the revolving loan facility 
additional financial flexibility was created by provisions in the amendment that expand our ability to incur unsecured debt and allow us to request but not require lenders to extend the maturity of their respective portions of the revolving loan facility from november  to august  in connection with the amendment  we paid certain one time fees to the lenders totaling approximately million  including an amendment fee to each lender that approved the amendment of basis points of the lender s outstanding term loans and or revolving loan facility commitments 
giving effect to the amortization of these fees and the increased interest rate add ons described above  the amendment will result in an increase in annual interest expense of million on the principal amount of debt outstanding at march  in addition to the availability under the senior credit facilities  we had million of cash and cash equivalents at december   approximately million of which were required for daily operations 
our capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million  including approximately million to complete the construction of the black hawk hotel  million for maintenance capital expenditures including the acquisition of slot machines and other long lived assets and million for various internal expansion projects 
actual capital expenditures will depend on the start date of certain projects and the progress of construction through year end  which start dates may be affected by our then current liquidity position and projected near term capital needs 
historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing 
if our existing sources of cash are insufficient to meet our operations and liquidity requirements  we will be required to seek additional financing that would be significantly more expensive than our senior credit facilities and or scale back our capital plans 
any loss from service of our properties for any reason could materially adversely affect us  including our ability to fund daily operations and to satisfy debt covenants 
inflation although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of securities and exchange commission regulation s k 
contractual and other commitments the following table summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contracts  including long term debt obligations  capitalized leases  operating leases and certain construction contracts 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations after total long term debt instruments estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases material construction contracts total estimated interest payments on long term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding after giving effect to projected borrowings in and forecasted libor rates for our senior credit facilities 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commitments after total letters of credit our cash tax payments for are expected to be approximately million  but are subject to our final assessment of the impact of recent tax legislation 
as further discussed in note federal and state income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin on january  we had million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions  it is not possible to assign the liability as of december  to any particular years in the table 
as noted above  a significant operating use of cash in is interest payments 
our cash interest payments  excluding capitalized interest  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash interest payments will likely increase in as a result of a possible rise in interest rates and higher interest rate add ons following the amendment of our current senior credit facilities 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business  including construction contracts for projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole 
our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 
in december  we assumed several agreements with the missouri highway transportation development district development district that had been entered into in order to assist the development district in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the ameristar kansas city property prior to our purchase of that property 
in order to pay for the highway improvement project  the development district issued revenue bonds totaling million in principal amount with scheduled maturities from through we have obtained an irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank in support of obligations of the development district for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds 
the amount outstanding under this letter of credit was million as of december  and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds 
additionally  we are obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds as well as any costs incurred by the development district that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy the bondholders 
through december   we had paid million in shortfalls and other costs 
as required by the agreements  we anticipate that we will be reimbursed by the development district for these shortfall payments from future available cash flow  as defined  and have recorded a corresponding receivable as of december  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our revolving loan facility 
two letters of credit totaling million expired without renewal on january   resulting in a corresponding increase to the amount available for borrowing under our revolving loan facility 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had approximately million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of ameristar east chicago in september and the missouri properties in december as required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we perform an annual assessment of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if the carrying value exceeded the fair value 
additionally  sfas no 
requires an immediate impairment assessment if a change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair of value a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in addition to our annual fourth quarter review  we performed an impairment review of ameristar east chicago s goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the first quarter of due to a significant deterioration of the debt and equity capital markets  weakening economic conditions and changes in forecasted operations that materially affected the property s fair value 
we perform impairment reviews under a two step method required by sfas no 
under the first step  we are required to estimate the fair value of reporting units to determine if any implied impairment exists 
we utilize both the market approach and the income approach present value techniques in the determination of fair value 
under the market approach  the value of invested capital is derived through industry multiples and other assumptions 
the income approach requires fair value to be measured through the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit 
taking into account both the income and market approach fair value estimates  we determined that the carrying value of ameristar east chicago exceeded the fair value and we were required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
in step two of the impairment test  we determined the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the implied fair value of the ameristar east chicago goodwill was less than the carrying value and the excess was recorded as an impairment charge 
the gaming license for ameristar east chicago was also tested for impairment under sfas no 
using an excess earnings valuation technique 
the fair value calculated for the gaming license was less than the carrying value and an impairment charge was recorded for the difference 
the impairment assessments performed in the first and fourth quarters of resulted in a total of million of impairment charges relating to the goodwill and gaming license acquired in the purchase of the east chicago property 
the impairment charges reduced the gaming license by million and goodwill by million 
guest rewards programs our guest rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests gaming activity 
guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent month period 
as a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
the accruals are based on historical data  estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards 
the retail value of the point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
at december  and  the outstanding guest reward point liability was million and million  respectively 
cash coupons our former  current and future gaming guests may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play  are redeemable within a short time period generally seven days 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million and million  respectively 
we utilize actuaries who consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities  based upon statistical data provided by the independent third party administrators of the various programs 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
accounting for share based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
these fair values are calculated by using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the option

for the years ended december   and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively  as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the company s stock incentive plans 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
income taxes our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate 
we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of fin  which we adopted on january  fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
as a result  our income tax recognition policy related to uncertain income tax positions is no longer covered by sfas no 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step i occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step ii is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained 
under step ii  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
fin s use of the term more likely than not is consistent with how that term is used in sfas no 
ie  the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 
the tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard 
if it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard  it is required that the tax position be derecognized 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions 
as applicable  we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facilities 
the senior credit facilities bear interest equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable margin  or add on 
as of december   we had billion outstanding under our senior credit facilities  bearing interest at variable rates based on libor with maturities up to three months from that date 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities outstanding  before giving effect to interest rate hedging transactions in place on that date  was 
during the second quarter of  in order to hedge against increases in variable interest rates  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank counterparty  effective july   pursuant to which we are obligated to make quarterly fixed rate payments to the counterparty at an annual rate of  calculated on a notional amount of million  while the counterparty is obligated to make quarterly floating rate payments to us based on three month libor for the same notional amount 
the interest rate swap effectively fixes the annual interest rate on million of borrowings under our senior revolving loan facility at plus the applicable margin 
the swap agreement terminates on july  effective october   we entered into an additional interest rate swap transaction with another commercial bank counterparty 
we are obligated to make quarterly fixed rate payments to the counterparty  calculated on a notional amount of million  while the counterparty is obligated to make quarterly floating rate payments to us based on three month libor on the same notional amount 
the swap transaction effectively fixes the annual interest rate on million of our revolving debt at plus the applicable margin 
this swap transaction terminates on july  including this swap agreement  we have billion of our variable rate debt hedged until july at a weighted average fixed rate of plus the applicable margin 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for more discussion of the interest rate swaps 
assuming no change in our borrowing elections under our senior credit facilities and giving effect to the billion of interest rate swap transactions in place on december   an increase of one percentage point in libor for all relevant maturities as of december  would increase our annual interest cost and decrease pre tax earnings by approximately million 
at december   we had no interest rate hedging agreements in place 
an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facilities outstanding at december  would have increased our annual interest cost by approximately million 
the decisions to enter into the swap agreements were based on analyses of risks to the company presented by possible changes in interest rates and the financial instruments available to manage those risks 
we continue to monitor interest rate markets and  in order to control interest rate risk  may enter into additional interest rate swap or collar agreements or other derivative instruments as market conditions warrant 
we may also refinance a portion of our variable rate debt through the issuance of long term fixed rate securities 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes
