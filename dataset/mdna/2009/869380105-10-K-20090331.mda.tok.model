item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our disclaimer on forward looking statements  item business  item a risk factors  item selected financial data and consolidated financial statements  the notes to those statements and other financial information contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
background and overview our primary focus is to provide real time systems solutions  including equipment and software  and services to our customers in the areas of hydrological monitoring and control  meteorological monitoring including airport weather systems  oceanic monitoring and hydrological services 
we design  manufacture and market these products and services to a diversified customer base consisting of federal  state  local and foreign governments  engineering companies  universities and hydropower companies 
our products and services enable these entities to monitor and collect hydrological  meteorological and oceanic data for the management of critical water resources  for early warning of potentially disastrous floods  storms or tsunamis  for the optimization of hydropower plants and for providing real time weather conditions at airports 
our key products are the satlink transmitter logger  the xpert xlite dataloggers  the accububble self contained bubbler  the accubar pressure sensor and xconnect systems software 
these are the essential components of most systems and are provided to customers as off the shelf equipment or as part of a custom system 
the satlink is a key product because it functions both as a transmitter and logger 
it is an excellent solution for small systems that do not require a significant number of sensors or communications options 
the xpert and xlite are more powerful dataloggers that have significant more logging capability and communications options than the satlink we expanded our services capabilities when we started our hydrological services division in the principal customer of this division has been the south florida water management district sfwmd which is a regional agency of the state of florida that is charged with managing and protecting water resources in a county area 
we provide a variety of services to sfwmd as well as other entities including hydrologic modeling  flood and stormwater management  river and stream analysis  and equipment integration  installation  commissioning and maintenance 
we are beginning fiscal year with a backlog of approximately  as compared to beginning fiscal year with a backlog of approximately  we estimate that approximately of our december  backlog will convert to revenue in we anticipate that we will continue to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our sales and revenues in operating results will depend upon the product mix and upon the timing of project awards 
international sales  which totaled of revenues for  continue to constitute a more significant portion of our revenues 
we expect international revenues to grow as a percentage of our total business 
international sales are however difficult to forecast and international awards are frequently delayed due to governmental approvals 
our contract with the ministry of energy and water in afghanistan could be impacted by security issues 
if stations cannot be installed in certain areas of the country due to security issues  this could result in a reduction in the scope of work and in the contract value 
contract backlog on this project at december  was approximately  we are committed to our airport weather systems business which only competes internationally although we compete against established firms with more experience 
our domestic business is highly dependent upon government business 
contracts and purchase orders with federal  state and local government agencies represented approximately of our revenues 
due to economic conditions in  we believe that competition was more price based and that some projects were delayed due to funding issues 
we are closely following the federal economic stimulus plan 
we believe that we will benefit from increased future spending on water resources projects 
we believe that this will result in major customer orders in and from our federal and state customers 
we are committed to growing our hydrological services however our primary customer in florida has expanded the pool of qualified contractors on all our contracts 
we therefore must expand our business outside of sfwmd 
we also hope to sell significantly more standard products through our hydrological services which was a primary reason for setting up operations in florida 
we have added the ilex division through our purchase of ilex engineering on december  we believe that ilex will help us compete better in the goes data collection services market and global satellite market  both domestically and internationally 
we are committed in our ongoing sales  marketing and research and development activities to sustain and grow our sales and revenues from our products and services 
we expect our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses to increase moderately in as compared to critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an on going basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess and obsolete inventories  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
o revenue recognition  o allowance for doubtful accounts  o allowances for excess and obsolete inventories  o accounting for warranty obligations  o accounting for income taxes  o accounting and valuation of stock option compensation 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
in general  we record revenue when it is realized  or realizable  and earned 
we consider these requirements met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the products or services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenue reflects reductions attributable to discounts and customer returns 
for our products  consisting of both equipment and software  revenue is recognized upon shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance of the product  as agreed in the customer order or contract 
we do sell our software products without the related equipment although software products are integral to systems 
our typical system requires no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware 
for complex systems  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance 
we do provide customer discounts and do allow for product returns 
we do not do consignment sales or bill and hold 
revenue reflects reductions due to discounts and product returns 
product returns have historically been insignificant in amount 
our sales arrangements for systems often include services in addition to equipment and software 
these services could include equipment integration  software customization  installation  maintenance  training  and customer support 
for sales arrangements that include bundled hardware  software and services  we account for any undelivered service offering as a separate element of a multiple element arrangement 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 
revenue for these services is typically recognized ratably over the period benefited or when the services are complete 
we use the percentage of completion method for recognizing revenue and profits when we perform on fixed price contracts that extend over a number of years 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profits are recorded as costs are incurred based on estimates of total sales value and costs at completion where total profit can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and ultimate realization is reasonably assured 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes and facts  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if targets are achieved 
incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded 
we recognize revenue from time and materials contracts to the extent of billable rates  times hours delivered  plus direct materials costs incurred 
some of the contracts include provisions to withhold a portion of the contract value as retainage 
our policy is to take into revenue the full value of the contract  including any retainage  as we perform against the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise from the normal course of selling products on credit to customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for estimated uncollectable accounts 
accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices are analyzed when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
individual accounts are charged against the allowance when collection efforts have been exhausted 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we provide allowances on inventories for any material that has become obsolete or may become unsaleable based on estimates of future demand and sale price in the market 
judgments with respect to saleability and usage of inventories  estimated market value  and recoverability upon sale are complex and subjective 
such assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changed conditions 
warranty obligations we warranty our products for up to two years and estimated warranty costs are based upon management s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on equipment sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered include actual past experience of product returns and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs as well as technological advances and enhanced design and manufacturing processes 
if actual future product return rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability are made 
income taxes we are taxed as a domestic us corporation under the internal revenue code 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the tax asset will not be utilized 
stock option compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  shared based payment  sfas r  on january   which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
additionally  the corporation follows the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab  issued in march  which provides supplemental sfas r application guidance based on the views of the sec 
the corporation adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  share based compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  included a compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all share based awards granted beginning january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the corporation s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain income statement data of the company expressed as a percentage of revenues year ended december  net sales and revenues cost of sales and revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income interest income expense 


income before income taxes income taxes benefit net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales and revenues net sales and revenues for decreased to million from million in the decrease was due to decreased revenues from sales of standard products and to decreased project activity 
revenues are reported internally by principal operating division or profit center consisting of the hydromet products division  the integrated services division  which includes airport weather systems and special projects that are funded r d activities  the hydrological services division and sutron s india operations 
the hydromet products division  which is responsible for sales of standard products  experienced a revenue decrease of to million from million in integrated systems revenue decreased to million from million in revenues from the hydrological services division decreased to million from million in revenues from our india operations decreased to thousand as compared to thousand in domestic net sales and revenues for decreased to million from million in net sales and revenues from standard products decreased to million in from million in due primarily to decreased orders from our federal customers 
net sales and revenues from integrated systems decreased to million compared to million in  due to two projects awarded to us totaling approximately thousand with the state of new mexico being put on hold until land rights issues are resolved 
our integrated systems experienced a decrease in project awards in as well 
net sales and revenues from hydrological services decreased to million from million in as a result of investigations of our former hydrological services vice president in both and by sfwmd  our largest customer in florida  several large contracts were delayed resulting in decreased work orders 
one of these contracts was awarded in december however the number of approved contractors was expanded from four in the previous contract to nine in the current contract 
the other contract was not awarded until october due to the resolution of sfwmd s investigations and the contract awards  we anticipate that our revenues will increase significantly in over international net sales and revenues decreased to million in from million in net sales and revenues from standard products decreased to million from million in we shipped approximately thousand of standard products to customers in china in for water level stations relating to the three gorges dam 
we did not receive any similar orders in but anticipate significant orders in for water level stations for the three gorges dam 
net sales and revenues from integrated systems were flat at million 
in  integrated systems recognized revenues that totaled million from a contract with the ministry of energy and water in afghanistan to provide and install stream monitoring stations 
we anticipate that this contract will be completed in however security concerns may result in some installations being cancelled 
net sales and revenues from our india operations decreased to thousand as compared to thousand in our india operations bid on some substantial projects in  totaling over million  but was underbid by more than on each 
to date  our competitors have not delivered their systems to the customers 
revenues were primarily from annual maintenance contracts 
the renewal of several annual maintenance contracts was also delayed in resulting in decrease maintenance revenues 
the department of the interior  the principal agencies being the us geological survey and the bureau of reclamation  was our largest customer accounting for and of total revenues in years and  respectively 
federal government revenues were in both and state and local government  commercial and international revenues represented of revenues in and cost of sales and revenues cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to for compared to for the increase reflects changes in sales volume  product mix and standard product content in projects 
in  our hydromet products division had decreased standard product revenues that caused our manufacturing group to be less efficient and to incur lower fixed costs recovery 
in  our integrated systems division s projects had less standard product content than in resulting in higher project costs as a percentage of revenue 
in  integrated services benefited from a million order from washington international group for water level monitoring stations to be delivered to the iraq ministry of water resources 
although the washington international group order was a project award  most items were standard products 
standard products carry substantially higher margins than projects 
our hydrological services division experienced a revenue decrease that resulted in higher cost absorption 
we downsized personnel  leased space and vehicles but not sufficiently to offset the decrease in revenues 
we do not anticipate additional reductions in cost of sales for both and include provisions for inventory obsolescence  physical inventory adjustments  inventory valuation adjustments and warranty provision adjustments 
we continually pursue product cost reductions through continual review of procurement sourcing based on quality and cost goals  product value engineering and improvements in manufacturing processes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in we experienced higher general and administrative costs in due to increases in board of director annual retainers and fees  legal costs relating to our ilex acquisition  audit fees and project management costs relating to the build out of our new corporate headquarters and production facility 
we experienced higher selling expenses in relating to our india operations and our hydrological services division 
product research and development expenses product research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in which is attributable to the decrease in revenues 
in  we focused our product development on enhancements to the xpert datalogger and to the satlink transmitter logger 
we developed a total precipitation gage upgrade kit for the national weather service that resulted in a contract award of approximately  in september we also performed work on a small business innovation research sbir contract in the amount of approximately  that was received in the sbir was to continue to develop and test a prototype preliminary design and specifications for a dcpi low power and low cost command receiver 
the new dcpi data collection platform with interrogate capability employing ds cdma rf transmission techniques will allow two way communication through the goes satellite system and other geostationary satellite systems 
we anticipate that the prototype will be delivered in may interest income and expense  net we earned net interest income of  in as compared with net interest income of  in although our cash and cash equivalent balances were higher throughout as compared to  the decrease in interest rates caused a decrease in net interest income 
income taxes income tax expense for was  compared to  for the provision for income taxes for represents an effective tax rate of approximately compared with for fiscal compared to fiscal net sales and revenues net sales and revenues for decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased domestic project revenues

net sales and revenues from hydrological services decreased to million from million in due to decreased project activity 
international net sales and revenues increased to million in from million in net sales and revenues from standard products increased to million from million in net sales and revenues from integrated systems increased to million from million due primarily to revenues of million from an order from washington group international to provide water level  snow  rainfall and water quality monitoring equipment to the iraq ministry of water resources 
sutron india operations had net sales and revenues of thousand as compared to million in due to decreased project activity as the central water commission project to provide rainfall monitoring stations was near completion and acceptance at the end of the department of the interior  the principal agencies being the us geological survey and the bureau of reclamation  was our largest customer accounting for and of total revenues in years and  respectively 
state and local government  commercial and international revenues represented of revenues in and in cost of sales and revenues cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to for compared to for the decrease reflects changes in product mix 
in  our hydromet products division had increased standard product revenues which enabled us to be more efficient and to recover fixed costs 
our integrated systems division also helped to reduce cost of sales as they benefited from the washington international group order which consisted primarily of standard products 
standard products carry substantially higher margins than projects 
in  we had substantial project work with the army corps of engineers in new orleans that was labor intensive resulting in higher cost of sales 
our hydrological services division experienced a revenue decrease that resulted in higher cost absorption and had one contract that was underbid by the former vice president of the division that resulted in substantial losses 
cost of sales for both and include provisions for inventory obsolescence  physical inventory adjustments and inventory valuation adjustments 
we continually pursue product cost reductions through continual review of procurement sourcing based on quality and cost goals  product value engineering and improvements in manufacturing processes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increased expenses were primarily due to the addition of two domestic salesmen in  higher legal costs relating to a lawsuit against a former employee to recover monetary damages  sox compliance costs and higher standby letter of credit fees relating to performance bonds for various international projects 
product research and development expenses product research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in in  product development focused on two water level sensors 
the first was a radar water level sensor which is a precision water level measuring instrument that uses radar pulses without direct contact with the water surface 
the second was a continuous flow bubbler system which operates in severe cold conditions 
we also continued to focus on enhancements to the xpert and xlite dataloggers that were upgraded in and released in interest income and expense  net we earned net interest income of  in as compared with net interest income of  in higher cash and cash equivalent balances were responsible for the increase in net interest income

we have a revolving credit facility of  with branch banking and trust bb t 
we are permitted to borrow based on accounts receivable and inventory according to pre established criteria 
the credit facility expires on august  and is secured by substantially all assets of the company 
borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
during  there was no borrowing on the line of credit 
we frequently bid on and enter into international contracts that require bid and performance bonds 
at december  and  bb t had issued standby letters of credit in the amount of  and  that served as either bid or performance bonds 
the amount available to borrow under the line of credit was reduced by these amounts 
management believes that its existing cash resources  cash flow from operations and short term borrowings on the existing credit line will provide adequate resources for supporting operations during fiscal although there can be no assurance that our revolving credit facility will be renewed  management believes that  if needed  it would be able to find alternative sources of funds on commercially acceptable terms 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk although the majority or our sales  costs of sales and selling costs are transacted in us dollars  a portion of our revenue is denominated in india rupees 
consequently  a portion of our revenues  costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the india rupee 
we recognized a foreign currency loss of approximately  in  a foreign currency gain of approximately  in and a foreign currency loss of approximately  in due to intercompany payable balances owed to us by our sutron india entities 
fluctuations between the us dollar and the india rupee may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
interest rate risk we currently invest our cash balances  in excess of our current needs  in an interest bearing savings account and in a certificate of deposit 
we do not invest for the purposes of trading in securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investments
