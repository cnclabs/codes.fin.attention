item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald s restaurants 
of the  restaurants in countries at year end   were operated by franchisees including  operated by conventional franchisees   operated by developmental licensees and  operated by foreign affiliated markets affiliates primarily in japan and  were operated by the company 
under our conventional franchise arrangement  franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment  signs  seating and d cor of their restaurant businesses  and by reinvesting in the business over time 
the company owns the land and building or secures long term leases for both company operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites 
this maintains long term occupancy rights  helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees 
under our developmental license arrangement  licensees provide capital for the entire business  including the real estate interest  while the company has no capital invested 
in addition  the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market 
we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our mix of company operated and franchised conventional franchised  developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability 
in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve both goals 
although direct restaurant operation is more capital intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues  company operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets 
in our company operated restaurants  and in collaboration with our franchisees  we further develop and refine operating standards  marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies  so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced systemwide 
in addition  we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing company personnel with restaurant operations experience 
our company operated business also helps to facilitate strategic changes in restaurant ownership 
the company s revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees 
revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments  and initial fees 
revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales  and may include initial fees 
fees vary by type of site  amount of company investment  if any  and local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise license agreements that generally have year terms 
the business is managed as distinct geographic segments 
significant reportable segments include the united states us  europe  and asia pacific  middle east and africa apmea 
in addition  throughout this report we present other countries corporate that includes operations in canada and latin america  as well as corporate activities 
the us  europe and apmea segments account for  and of total revenues  respectively 
france  germany and the united kingdom uk  collectively  account for approximately of europe s revenues  and australia  china and japan a owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method  collectively  account for over of apmea s revenues 
these six markets along with the us and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise over of total revenues 
the company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the mcdonald s restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for long term growth remain significant 
accordingly  in second quarter  the company sold its minority ownership interest in uk based pret a manger for million 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized a nonoperating gain 
during the third quarter  the company sold its investment in boston market 
in  the company disposed of its investment in chipotle mexican grill chipotle via public stock offerings and a tax free exchange for mcdonald s common stock 
as a result of the disposals during and  both boston market s and chipotle s results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in analyzing business trends  management considers a variety of performance and financial measures  including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth  systemwide sales growth  restaurant margins and returns 
constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the company s underlying business trends 
comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the company s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends 
increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions  respectively  from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months  including those temporarily closed 
comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation 
some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling  rebuilding  road construction and natural disasters 
mcdonald s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month  quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days 
the number of weekdays  weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts 
the company refers to these impacts as calendar shift trading day adjustments 
these impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal 
in  there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to the leap year 
systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants  whether operated by the company or by franchisees 
while sales by franchisees are not recorded as revenues by the company  management believes the information is important in understanding the company s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and 
table of contents records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base 
return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization numerator by the adjusted cash used for investing activities denominator  primarily capital expenditures 
the calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation 
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment between the company  its franchisees and suppliers collectively referred to as the system has been key to mcdonald s success over the years 
this business model enables mcdonald s to consistently deliver locally relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve 
in addition  it facilitates our ability to identify  implement and scale innovative ideas that meet our customers changing needs and preferences 
mcdonald s customer centered plan to win which is focused on being better  not just bigger provides a common framework for our restaurants yet allows for local adaptation 
the plan facilitates the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences people  products  place  price and promotion 
through the execution of these initiatives  we have enhanced the mcdonald s experience for customers worldwide  growing sales and guest counts in each of the last five years 
this plan  coupled with financial discipline  has delivered strong results for shareholders 
we have exceeded our long term  constant currency financial targets of average annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of to  average annual operating income growth of to  and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the plan s implementation in  after adjusting for the latin america developmental license transaction 
given the size and scope of our global business  we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable  enabling us to focus on those opportunities that best optimize long term shareholder value 
in  we continued to focus on our key global success factors of branded affordability  menu variety and beverage choice  convenience and daypart expansion  ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence 
locally relevant initiatives around each of these success factors resonated with consumers increasingly busy lifestyles and their growing demand for menu variety  value and simple  enjoyable eating out experiences 
as a result  every area of the world contributed to global comparable sales and guest counts increasing and  respectively  despite a challenging economic environment in many countries 
in the us  we continued to drive sales higher and increase our share of the informal eating out market in due to our ongoing focus on breakfast  chicken  beverages  convenience and branded affordability 
we extended our leadership in the breakfast and chicken categories with the launch of the southern style chicken biscuit for breakfast and southern style chicken sandwich for the remainder of the day 
we profitably built greater visit frequency by leveraging our convenient locations  extended hours  drive thru service and value oriented local beverage promotions that often featured our popular iced coffee and sweet tea 
as part of our multi year strategy to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category  we began rolling out espresso based hot and cold specialty coffees 
at year end  over  restaurants were offering the new specialty coffees  and we expect to complete the roll out in mid to accommodate the related new equipment as well as enable potential future offerings such as smoothies  frappes and bottled beverages  construction is required in many restaurants 
in most cases this construction also involves expanding and optimizing the efficiency of our drive thru booth  which enables us to better serve even more customers  faster 
the company is investing capital to fund a portion of this construction related reinvestment for franchised restaurants 
in europe  we posted record high comparable sales growth in every country contributed to this performance  which was led by france  the uk  russia and germany 
this success was driven in part by greater local customer relevance created by our tiered menu approach  featuring an effective combination of premium selections  classic menu favorites  everyday value and popular limited time food promotions 
we also connected with customers throughout the day with new sandwiches such as the bacon roll for breakfast in the uk and premium m burger in france  germany and the uk we continued upgrading the mcdonald s experience by reimaging more than locations  primarily in the uk and germany 
in addition  we continued the roll out of a new kitchen operating system currently in about  of our european restaurants to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety 
open communication and transparency is especially important to european consumers 
to build brand trust  we actively communicated the facts about mcdonald s as an employer and highlighted the quality and nutrition of our food with the early launch of the company s new global packaging design 
in apmea  our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales  driven by australia  japan and china 
in addition  aggressive restaurant development in china where we opened our  th restaurant contributed to revenue growth 
our performance was driven by strategic initiatives surrounding convenience  breakfast  core menu extensions and value 
we further enhanced mcdonald s convenience with drive thru and delivery service  as well as expansion of extended hours to or about  of our restaurants in apmea 
we built on the momentum of our breakfast business  currently in of our restaurants in apmea  by raising customer awareness  trial and visit frequency with relevant marketing and new menu offerings like the egg  tomato and pepper mcpuff in china 
we also continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability platforms and locally relevant new product launches such as the premium chicken line in australia and new zealand 
our customer centered strategies to drive global momentum also consider price and product mix as a means to enhance restaurant profitability 
this approach is complemented by a focus on optimizing restaurant operations and effectively managing food and paper costs by leveraging our scale  supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies 
as a result  amid a volatile commodity environment  mcdonald s delivered consolidated company operated restaurant margins of its highest in nine years 
strong sales and margin performance positively impacted growth in cash from operations  which rose billion to billion in our substantial cash flow  strong credit rating and continued access to credit provides us significant flexibility to 
table of contents fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders 
in  capital expenditures of billion were primarily used to open restaurants net  after closings and reimage  locations 
in addition  we believe strongly in returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases 
in  we returned billion to shareholders  consisting of billion in dividends and billion in share repurchases 
this brings total cash returned to billion under our billion to billion target 
we are confident we will achieve this cash return target given the ongoing strength and stability of cash from operations and our continued evolution toward a more heavily franchised  less capital intensive business model 
we believe locally owned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage  making us not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one 
in addition  an optimized mix of franchised and company operated restaurants helps to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns 
to that end  in august  the company completed the sale of its businesses in brazil  argentina  mexico  puerto rico  venezuela and other countries in latin america and the caribbean  which totaled  restaurants  to a developmental licensee organization 
under the new ownership structure  the company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of company operated sales and franchised rents and royalties 
in addition  in we set a three year target to refranchise  to  existing company operated restaurants between and  primarily in our major markets 
in  we refranchised about restaurants  increasing the percent of franchised restaurants worldwide to from at year end this transition to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants is expected to affect consolidated financial statements as follows a negative impact on consolidated revenues as company operated sales shift to franchised sales where we receive rent and or royalties  along with initial fees 
a decrease in company operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars  while margin percentages will vary based on sales and cost structures of refranchised restaurants 
fluctuations in other operating income expense due to gains and or losses resulting from sales of restaurants 
an increase in combined operating margin percent 
an increase in return on average assets due primarily to a decrease in average asset balances 
highlights from the year included comparable sales grew and guest counts rose  building on increases of and  respectively 
systemwide sales increased in constant currencies 
company operated margins improved to and franchised margins improved to 
net income per share from continuing operations was  an increase of after adjusting for the impact of the latin america transaction 
cash provided by operations totaled billion and capital expenditures totaled billion 
returned billion to shareholders through shares repurchased and dividends paid  including a increase in the quarterly cash dividend to per share for the fourth quarter bringing our current annual dividend rate to per share 
one year roiic was and three year roiic was for outlook for we will continue to drive success in and beyond by remaining focused on being better  not just bigger 
we will do so by further enhancing our understanding of consumers needs and wants  facilitating greater sharing and adoption of best practices and new ideas worldwide  and leveraging a strategic approach to implementing initiatives to drive the best bottom line impact 
despite challenging economic conditions  the mcdonald s system is energized by our current worldwide momentum 
we will continue to build on our strength in five key areas maintaining the balance between price and value  maximizing the benefit of available capital by improving the relevance and contemporary feel of our existing restaurants  leveraging the equity and unique tastes of core menu favorites like the big mac  the quarter pounder with cheese and our world famous french fries  continuing our financial discipline and evaluation of success measures to ensure these measures are driving actions that positively impact our restaurants  and furthering operations excellence by focusing on improved execution 
as we do so  we are confident we can meet or exceed the long term constant currency financial targets previously discussed 
in the us  our focus is to continue to build relevance and loyalty by staying connected to customers needs for menu variety and beverage choice  everyday affordability and convenience 
our initiatives will include reminding customers of the enduring appeal of menu classics such as the big mac and encouraging trial of new sandwich and beverage options including specialty coffees 
also in  we will continue to offer value across our menu from the dollar menu to our premium products  as well as our classic menu favorites and mid tier offerings such as our double cheeseburger and snack wraps 
these initiatives combined with the convenience of our locations  optimized drive thru service  cashless transactions and longer operating hours will reinforce mcdonald s position as our customers preferred place and way to eat 
our priorities in europe remain upgrading the customer and employee experience  enhancing local relevance and building brand transparency 
in  we will continue upgrading our restaurants ambiance through reimaging  including adding another mccafes primarily in germany and france 
in addition  we will focus on optimizing our drive thru service  completing the conversion of our kitchen operating system in most european restaurants and increasing total locations offering extended and hour service 
we also will strengthen our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with new products and a relevant variety of limited time food events featuring beef  chicken  desserts and coffee selections 
in the area of brand transparency  we will remain open and accessible and will continue to inform consumers about our food quality and reputation as an employer 
in apmea  our goal is to be consumers first choice when eating out 
to achieve this goal  locally relevant strategies surrounding convenience  breakfast and branded affordability are essential in this diverse and dynamic part of the world 
convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of hour or extended operating hours  offering delivery service and building our drive thru 
table of contents traffic 
we will also aggressively continue to open new restaurants in china 
we will further build our breakfast business in apmea by increasing the number of locations where it is served  utilizing innovative marketing support and launching new products 
at the same time  we will continue to highlight our classic menu favorites and offer locally relevant extensions of these products 
in addition  we are further leveraging a strategic pricing tool to optimize menu prices to drive sales and profits 
in  we will continue to optimize the mix of franchised and company operated restaurants and will refranchise restaurants under the previously mentioned target 
the speed with which we make progress toward this goal will depend on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets 
we will also continue to evaluate several small markets in apmea and europe for potential transition to developmental license structures 
we will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the long term 
as previously discussed  our evolution toward a more heavily franchised  less capital intensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest  the strength and stability of our cash flow and our long term returns 
as a result  we expect free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures will continue to grow and be a significant source to fund total cash returned to shareholders 
in addition  we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in our outstanding share count 
finally  we will continue to be disciplined financially  remaining diligent about how and where we invest capital and selling  general and administrative expenses to grow our business 
consistent with the last few years  to drive sales and returns we will allocate nearly of our billion of planned capital expenditures toward reinvestments in existing restaurants  mainly related to the reimaging of locations in europe and the rollout of the beverage strategy in the us the remainder of our capital expenditures will primarily be used to build new locations 
mcdonald s does not provide specific guidance on net income per share 
the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the company s results changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion 
the company expects net restaurant additions to add nearly percentage points to systemwide sales growth in constant currencies  most of which will be due to the net traditional restaurants added in the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales 
however  as a perspective  assuming no change in cost structure  a percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the us or europe would increase annual net income per share by about cents 
with about of mcdonald s grocery bill comprised of different commodities  a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company s commodity costs 
for the full year  the total basket of goods is expected to rise about to in the us and about to in europe with more of this pressure occurring in the first half of the year 
some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business 
the company expects full year selling  general administrative expenses to decline  in constant currencies  although fluctuations may be experienced between quarters due to certain items in such as the biennial worldwide owner operator convention and the beijing summer olympics 
based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates  the company expects interest expense in to be relatively flat compared with interest income in is expected to decrease about compared with due to expected lower average interest rates and average cash balances 
a significant part of the company s operating income is generated outside the us  and about of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro  british pound  australian dollar and canadian dollar 
collectively  these currencies represent approximately of the company s operating income outside the us if all four of these currencies moved by in the same direction compared with  the company s annual net income per share would change by about to cents 
due to the recent strengthening of the us dollar relative to virtually all foreign currencies  full year revenues and operating income will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation 
the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately to 
in the normal course of business and based on the timing of certain transactions and events  some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be approximately billion 
about half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to open about  restaurants traditional and satellites 
the company expects net additions of about restaurants net traditional additions and net satellite closings 
these restaurant numbers include new unit openings approximately in affiliated and developmental licensed markets  such as japan and latin america  where the company does not fund any capital expenditures 
for through  the company expects to return billion to billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  subject to business and market conditions 
for and combined  the company returned billion to shareholders 
the company continually reviews its restaurant ownership structures to optimize cash flow and returns and to enhance local relevance

the company refers to these markets as latam 
as a result of the latam transaction  the company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of company operated sales and franchised rents and royalties 
based on approval by the company s board of directors on april   the company concluded latam was held for sale as of that date in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of billion in  substantially all of which was noncash 
the charge included million for the difference between the net book value of the latam business and approximately million in cash proceeds received 
this loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction 
the charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of million recorded in shareholders equity 
the company recorded a tax benefit of million in in connection with this transaction

the company mitigates the currency impact to income through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements 
the buyers of the company s operations in latam entered into a year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers  among other obligations to i pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets  substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements  ii commit to adding approximately new mcdonald s restaurants by the end of and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened  and iii commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants

in most cases  franchising is the best way to achieve these goals  but as previously stated  company operated restaurants are also important to our success 
we report results for company operated restaurants based on their sales  less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs 
we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues  less associated occupancy costs 
for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure  we do not specifically allocate selling  general administrative expenses and other operating income expenses to company operated or franchised restaurants 
other operating items that relate to the company operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we believe the following information about company operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business 
management responsible for our company operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the company operated business on this basis to assess its performance 
management of the company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix  subject to other relevant considerations 
the following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our company operated margins 
the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations  which we refer to below as store operating margin 
the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties 
we refer to this component as brand real estate margin 
both company operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties  although rent and royalties for company operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation 
rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales  and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald s investment in the restaurant 
royalty rates may also vary by market 
as shown in the following tables  in disaggregating the components of our company operated margins  certain costs with respect to company operated restaurants are reflected in brand real estate margin 
those costs consist of rent payable by mcdonald s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy other operating expenses recorded on the consolidated statement of income 
store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses  and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating brand real estate margin 
while we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our company operated business  it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in particular  as noted above  we do not allocate selling  general administrative expenses to our company operated business 
however  we believe that a range of  to  per restaurant  on average  is a typical range of costs to support this business in the us the actual costs in markets outside the us will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market 
these costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant

this adjustment is made to reflect these occupancy costs in brand real estate margin 
the relative percentage of sites that are owned versus leased varies by country

this adjustment is made to reflect expense in store operating margin and income in brand real estate margin 
countries within europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales 
selling  general administrative expenses consolidated selling  general administrative expenses were flat decreased in constant currencies in and increased flat in constant currencies in the constant currency change benefited by percentage points due to the latam transaction 
in  expenses included costs related to the beijing summer olympics and the company s biennial worldwide owner operator convention

selling  general administrative expenses amount increase decrease increase decrease excluding currency translation dollars in millions us europe apmea other countries corporate total included in other countries corporate are home office support costs in areas such as facilities  finance  human resources  information technology  legal  marketing  restaurant operations  supply chain and training 
selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were in compared with in and in selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales were in compared with in and in management believes that analyzing selling  general administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales  as well as revenues  is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants

the company s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table 
while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus  it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt 
total 
table of contents adjusted debt  a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above  includes debt outstanding on the company s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases 
based on their most recent calculations  these agencies add between billion and billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes  which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes 
the company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments 
these adjustments include excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents  excluding certain company operated restaurant lease agreements outside the us that are cancelable with minimal penalties representing approximately of company operated restaurant minimum rents outside the us  based on the company s estimate  capitalizing non restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense  and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites 
based on this calculation  for credit analysis purposes  approximately billion to billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized 
certain of the company s debt obligations contain cross acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long term debt of certain subsidiaries 
there are no provisions in the company s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company s business 
under existing authorization from the company s board of directors  at december   the company has approximately billion of authority remaining to borrow funds  including through i public or private offering of debt securities  ii issuance of commercial paper  iii direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions  and iv other forms of indebtedness 
in addition to registered debt securities on a us shelf registration statement and a euro medium term notes program  the company has billion available under a committed line of credit agreement see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements 
debt maturing in is approximately million of long term corporate debt and million of outstanding commercial paper 
in  the company expects to issue commercial paper and long term debt in order to refinance this maturing debt and potentially finance a portion of the company s previously disclosed expectation to return billion to billion to shareholders 
the company also has million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year end 
historically  the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
although the recent instability in the financial markets has resulted in constraints on available credit  the company s ability to raise funding in the long term and short term debt capital markets has not been adversely affected 
in november  the company directly borrowed billion japanese yen million via a floating rate syndicated term loan maturing in in january  the company issued million of year us dollar denominated notes at a coupon rate of  and million of year us dollar denominated bonds at a coupon rate of the company uses major capital markets  bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated 
derivatives were recorded at fair value on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  as follows miscellaneous other assets million  prepaid expenses and other current assets million  accrued payroll and other liabilities million  and other long term liabilities excluding accrued interest million 
for the year ended december   the company s derivatives were recorded in miscellaneous other assets million and other long term liabilities excluding accrued interest million 
see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no 
regarding derivatives 
the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties  intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity 
total foreign currency denominated debt was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
in addition  where practical  the company s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges 
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements 
certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below  or aggregate exposures exceed  certain contractual limits 
at december   neither the company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position 
the company s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities at year end were as follows foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of us dollars euro australian dollars canadian dollars british pounds sterling russian ruble the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues  local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations related to both company operated and franchised restaurants and debt obligations 
in addition  the company has long term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements 
cash provided by operations including cash provided by these franchise arrangements along with the company s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december  see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details

the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to i make tax deferred contributions and ii receive company provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of irs limitations 
the investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market rate investment alternatives under the company s qualified profit sharing and savings plan 
total liabilities for the supplemental plans were million at december  and were primarily included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
also included in other long term liabilities at december  were gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and liabilities for international retirement plans of million 
in connection with the latam transaction  the company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims  certain of which are reflected in other long term liabilities on mcdonald s consolidated balance sheet totaling million at year end other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions 
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment  or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
share based compensation the company has a share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units rsus to employees and nonemployee directors 
the expense for these equity based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  such as the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected volatility of the company s stock over the expected life  which significantly impact the assumed fair value 
the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period 
long lived assets impairment review long lived assets including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of its operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales 
if the company s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
when the company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee  it determines when these businesses are held for sale in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

table of contents management and  if required  the company s board of directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets  the assets are available for disposal  the disposal is probable of occurring within months  and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets net book value  among other factors 
an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and the estimated cash sales price  less costs of disposal 
an alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees 
under this alternative for the latam transaction  approximately million of the billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of years  resulting in about million of expense annually 
this policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees 
the company bases its accounting policy on management s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements 
the company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market based fees in future periods  particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees 
therefore  the company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction 
litigation accruals from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to competitors  customers  employees  franchisees  government agencies  intellectual property  shareholders and suppliers 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies  including the sale of appreciated assets  in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
during  the irs examination of the company s us tax returns was completed 
the tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant 
during  the company recorded a million benefit as a result of the completion of an irs examination of the company s us tax returns 
the company s us tax return is currently under examination and the completion of the examination  which will ultimately include the us tax return  is expected in deferred us income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures 
the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the us if management s intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
effects of changing prices inflation although inflationary cost pressures increased globally in  the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust menu prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings  many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation 
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital return on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units  the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital 
this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation 
the numerator is the company s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization  from the base period  adjusted for the impact of the latam transaction in while the company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement  management believes the latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction 
management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented 
the denominator is the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one or three year period 
adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the boston market  chipotle  latam and pret a manger transactions 
the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis 
these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter s investing activities to incremental operating income 
for example  fourth quarter investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations 
in contrast  fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than months ago  and therefore have a full year impact on operating income  with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activities are included in the one year and three year calculations  respectively 
management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average
