item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our business  results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the other sections of this annual report 
we conduct our operations in two segments our more dominant exploration and production segment  and our significantly smaller gathering and processing segment 
except as otherwise specifically noted  or as the context requires otherwise  and except to the extent that differences between these segments or our geographic segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present this md a on a consolidated basis 
our md a includes the following sections overview a general description of our business  the value drivers of our business  measurements  and opportunities  challenges and risks 
financial risk management information about debt financing and financial risk management 
results of operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements 
liquidity  capital resources and financial position an analysis of our cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
critical accounting estimates a discussion of critical accounting estimates that represent choices between acceptable alternatives and or require management judgments and assumptions 
overview we are a fort worth  texas based independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production of natural gas  ngls  and crude oil 
we focus primarily on unconventional reservoirs where hydrocarbons may be found in challenging geological conditions such as fractured shales  coal beds and tight sands 
we generate revenue  income and cash flows by producing and selling natural gas  ngls and crude oil 
our production generates earnings and cash flow that allow us to conduct acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production activities to replace the reserves that we produce 
at december   approximately of our proved reserves were natural gas and ngls 
consistent with one of our business strategies  we have developed and applied the expertise gained in developing our now divested northeast operations to our projects in alberta  canada and our barnett shale interests in texas 
our texas and alberta reserves made up approximately and  respectively  of our proved reserves at december  our acreage in the horn river basin in british columbia will provide additional opportunity for further application of this expertise 
for  we plan to continue our focus on the development and exploitation of our properties in texas and alberta and to begin exploration in the horn river basin 
we have allocated million of our consolidated capital budget of million for drilling and completion activities 
approximately million is allocated to projects in texas and approximately million is allocated to our canadian projects 
approximately million of the capital budget has been allocated to construction of natural gas processing and gathering assets  including million to be funded directly by kgs 
our company focuses on three key value drivers reserve growth  production growth  and maximizing the company s operating cash flows 
our reserve growth relies on our ability to apply our technical and operational expertise in our core operating areas to develop  exploit and explore unconventional natural gas reservoirs 
we strive to increase 
table of contents reserves and production through aggressive management of operations and through relatively low risk development and exploitation drilling 
we will also continue to identify high potential exploratory projects with comparatively higher levels of financial risk 
all of our development and exploratory programs are aimed at providing us with opportunities to develop and exploit unconventional natural gas reservoirs which align our technical and operational expertise 
our core operating areas and the acreage that we hold are well suited for production increases through development and exploitation drilling 
we perform workover and infrastructure projects to reduce ongoing operating costs and increase current and future production rates 
we regularly review our operated properties to determine if steps can be taken to profitably increase reserves and production 
in evaluating the result of our efforts  we consider the capital efficiency of our drilling program and also measure the following key indicators reserve growth  production volumes  cash flow from operating activities  and earnings per share 
years ended december  organic reserve growth production volumes bcfe cash flow from operating activities in millions diluted earnings loss per share organic growth excludes reserves acquired or divested from beginning and ending reserves and from production 
this ratio is calculated by subtracting adjusted beginning of the year proved reserves from adjusted end of the year proved reserves and dividing by adjusted beginning of the year proved reserves 
adjusted beginning of the year reserves are calculated by deducting sold reserves and adjusted current year production from beginning of the year reserves 
adjusted current year production excludes production from purchased reserves 
adjusted end of the year reserves are calculated by deducting purchased reserves from end of the year reserves 
operating loss for includes a pretax charge of million for impairment associated with our us oil and gas properties 
net loss also includes million of pretax income attributable to the company s proportionate ownership of bbep and a pretax charge of million for impairment of that investment 
financial risk management we have established internal control policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization 
the possibility of decreasing prices received for our natural gas  ngl and crude oil production is among the several risks that we face 
we seek to manage this risk by entering into financial hedges 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of derivatives but  in doing so  have also limited our ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
this commodity price strategy enhances our ability to execute our development  exploitation and exploration programs  meet debt service requirements and pursue acquisition opportunities even in periods of price volatility

table of contents us increased mmcfd as a result of the impact of new wells placed into production partially offset by production declines for existing wells  primarily in the fort worth basin 
the november divestiture of our northeast operations reduced our natural gas production by mmcfd and the alliance acquisition increased production by mmcfd on an annualized basis 
additional wells on our canadian interests increased production by mmcfd from ngl revenue for increased as a result of production increases and realized prices that were per bbl higher than ngl realized prices 
additional texas natural gas production in the high btu area of the barnett shale and processing improvements during increased ngl volumes  bbld when compared to partially offsetting the texas production and pricing increases was the absence of production due to the divestiture of the northeast operations 
crude oil revenue for was higher than due to a per bbl increase in realized prices 
production increases of bbld from the fort worth basin in partially offset the divested production from the northeast operations 
our natural gas revenue for increased from as a result of both a per mcf increase in realized natural gas prices and a mmcfd increase in volumes as compared to natural gas revenue in the us increased mmcfd as a result of new wells placed into production  primarily in the fort worth basin 
the november divestiture of our northeast operations reduced our natural gas production as did natural production declines in this area 
additional wells on our canadian interests increased production by mmcfd from ngl revenue for was almost three times higher than  which primarily resulted from an incremental  mbbl increase in ngl production resulting from additional texas natural gas production in the high btu area of the barnett shale during also  more favorable pricing of per bbl contributed to the increase when compared to ngl revenue 
crude oil revenue for was higher than due to a per bbl increase in realized prices 
fort worth basin production in increased to partially offset the impact of the divestiture of our northeast operations 
other revenue other revenue  consisting primarily of revenue from the processing  gathering and marketing of natural gas  was million for  an increase of million compared with throughput from third parties in our gathering and processing assets operated by kgs increased other revenue by million 
partially offsetting the increase was the absence of million of canadian government grants for new drilling techniques we received in other revenue was million for  an increase of million compared with this increase is primarily due to million from higher throughput from third parties in our gathering and processing assets operated by kgs and million more in canadian government grants for new drilling techniques compared to hedge ineffectiveness in also increased other revenue million compared to 
table of contents operating expenses oil and gas production expenses years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per texas mcfe mcfe mcfe cash expense equity compensation northeast operations cash expense equity compensation other us cash expense equity compensation total us cash expense equity compensation canada cash expense equity compensation total company cash expense equity compensation oil and gas production expense for was almost unchanged from the absence of production expense of million for the divested northeast operations was offset by the growth of our operations in the fort worth basin and canada that increased production expense million and million  respectively  as production volumes increased and  respectively  for as compared to  as discussed previously 
although oil and gas production expense for our fort worth basin operations were million higher for  production expense per mcfe decreased to per mcfe when compared to the improvement in production expense on a mcfe basis was primarily the result of higher production levels  cost containment initiatives  new completion techniques used in our capital program and higher utilization of automation during canadian production expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in production volumes and an increase in personnel costs plus higher prevailing exchange rates during oil and gas production expense for increased by million from levels  primarily due to costs associated with higher production levels 
on a mcfe basis  our costs increased compared to levels 
although overall costs increased in texas  our production and number of producing properties increased 
table of contents while our cost per mcfe of production decreased 
our production costs for the northeast operations reflected million of employee severance cost associated with its divestiture 
northeast operations unit costs were also impacted by production declines 
the total cost increases reflect salary increases of million associated with headcount increases 
canadian production expense increased million due to an estimated million for currency effects of the strengthening canadian dollar  million higher gathering and processing costs  million in increased direct operating cost associated with new producing properties and more than million of overhead costs  including higher salaries  stock based compensation  incentive compensation and rent 
production and ad valorem taxes years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per production and ad valorem taxes mcfe mcfe mcfe us canada total production and ad valorem taxes production and ad valorem tax expense for increased slightly as compared to production and ad valorem taxes increased million due to the development of our fort worth basin properties and increased production 
this increase was nearly offset by the absence of production and ad valorem taxes associated with the divested northeast operations 
we have historically experienced low severance tax expense for our texas production as a result of exemptions and rate reductions for development of our acreage positions with wells deemed by the taxing authorities to be high cost wells 
we expect severance tax rates in texas to increase in future quarters as fewer of our wells to be drilled in and beyond will qualify for severance tax exemptions and rate reductions because we expect our fort worth basin drilling and completion costs to continue to decrease while the cost threshold for exemptions and rate reductions will increase 
production and ad valorem tax expense for was relatively flat when compared to as a million increase in ad valorem tax expense was mostly offset by a decrease in production taxes 
ad valorem tax expense increased primarily as a result of the growth in our texas and canadian property values associated with our capital expenditure program while production tax expense decreased as a result of a higher percentage of our production in texas that is partially or fully exempted from production taxes 

table of contents depletion  depreciation and accretion years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per mcfe mcfe mcfe depletion us canada total depletion depreciation of other fixed assets us canada total depreciation accretion total depletion  depreciation and accretion higher depletion expense for resulted from a increase in the depletion rate and a increase in production volumes 
our depletion rate was impacted by the addition of the proved oil and gas properties obtained in the alliance acquisition as well as the capital costs incurred for proved reserves added from our existing properties and increases in estimated future capital expenditures 
depreciation expense for was million higher than primarily due to additions of fort worth basin field compression and kgs midstream infrastructure  partially offset by the absence of million of depreciation expense associated with the divested northeast operations depreciable assets 
we expect depreciation expense will further increase when kgs places its million corvette plant into service in the first quarter of and we expect that depletion for our us properties will be approximately per mcfe after the impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of depletion expense in increased from primarily as a result of a increase in production 
our consolidated depletion rate increased per mcfe as a result of increased future development costs due in part to a higher percentage of undeveloped proved reserves for year end as compared to  and higher finding costs in in texas 
depreciation expense for was million higher than primarily resulting from increased capacity at our cowtown gas plant  additions to our cowtown pipeline and new canadian gas processing facilities 
impairment of oil and gas properties we recognized a noncash pretax charge of million million after tax for impairment related to our us oil and gas properties in december as required under full cost accounting rules  we performed a ceiling test by comparing the book value of our oil and gas properties  net of related deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations  to the year end ceiling limitation  which is the after tax value of the future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  including the effect of hedges 
as also required under full cost accounting rules prescribed by the sec  the ceiling amount was based upon year end prices and costs  discounted at per year 
under these rules  management has little ability to influence the ceiling amounts with respect to such factors as pricing  discount rate  cost structure and timing 
consequently  the ceiling amount is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of our oil and gas properties  which could have a wide range of potential fair values 
included below is an alternate valuation of our oil and gas reserves that supplements the ceiling amount and which management believes is more indicative of our oil and gas properties fair value as it incorporates the valuation techniques we employ in making investment decisions 

table of contents the alternate value presented below would have  if permitted in place of the ceiling amount  eliminated any recognition of impairment during this valuation was calculated in the same manner as the scenario used in the ceiling test  except for the following changes the forward strip prices on december   which featured future price increases and more appropriately reflect expected future realized prices  were used in place of year end prices held constant  production expense was adjusted to reflect actual consolidated oil and gas production expenses  and  income tax considerations are excluded from the analysis although they are required for the ceiling test computation 
management s alternate pretax valuation related to its proved oil and gas reserves at december  as described above was as follows united states canada total in thousands future revenues future production costs future development costs future net pretax cash flows discount management s estimate of pretax discounted future cash flows relating to proved reserves general and administrative expense years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per general and administrative expense mcfe mcfe mcfe cash expense litigation resolution equity compensation total general and administrative expense we recognized a charge of million in as a result of the settlement of litigation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the most significant increase in recurring general and administrative expense for was a million increase in employee compensation and benefits  including increases of million of non cash expense for vesting of stock based compensation and million in performance based compensation 
the remaining million increase in employee compensation is related to additional headcount which was necessary to bring our infrastructure to a level needed to accommodate growth in our operations and production 
after consideration of the breitburn transaction investment banking fees of million recognized in  fees for legal  accounting and other professional services increased general and administrative expense by approximately million  which resulted from additional regulatory filing requirements  litigation costs  expenses associated with evaluation of complex business transactions and the full year effect of kgs being a publicly traded partnership 
general and administrative expense for increased due to a million increase in stock based compensation and million in performance based compensation 
these increases relate to increased 
table of contents headcount at our corporate offices to develop additional capabilities necessary to support our growth 
general and administrative costs increased year over year by million for legal and professional fees which relate to professional services provided for the kgs ipo and our northeast operations divestiture 
other components of operating income during  we recognized a gain of million as a result of our divestiture of the northeast operations  and we recorded a loss on the michigan sales contract related to delivery of volumes in michigan 
further information regarding these transactions is included in item of this annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
breitburn related income and expenses during  we recognized million associated with the equity earnings in our investment in bbep for the period from november   when we acquired the bbep units  through september  this amount reflects our prevailing ownership interests for the applicable period before and after our ownership increased from to by virtue of bbep s purchase and retirement of units during bbep has experienced significant volatility in their net earnings due to changes in value of their derivative instruments  for which they do not employ hedge accounting 
during the fourth quarter of  the company considered the fair value of the bbep units along with the fair value trend of its peers  the trend and future petroleum strip prices and the limited availability of credit which occurred in the latter half of based on these factors  the company determined that the decrease in fair value of bbep units was other than temporary and recorded a pretax charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in bbep to its fair value 
management believes that certain alternative fair value measures  such as bbep s liquidation value  the estimated value of its properties and reserves  the present value of existing distribution levels and other calculations would have eliminated or materially lowered the impairment charge 
however  the prescriptive nature of the relevant gaap requires the company to ignore these alternative measures based upon availability of level inputs as described in sfas no 
interest expense years ended december  in thousands interest costs less interest capitalized interest expense interest costs for were higher than primarily because of higher average debt outstanding due to the issuance of our senior notes and our senior secured second lien facility due in  partially offset by a decrease in our average consolidated interest rate 
the higher debt levels in relate to the alliance acquisition and the funding of our capital program 
the increase in capitalized interest relates to more projects and costs within those projects being subject to capitalization 
interest was capitalized in for our exploration projects in the horn river basin and west texas and construction of the corvette plant by kgs 
for  interest expense increased million from primarily as a result of both higher debt balances and higher prevailing rates on the variable portion of our debt 
the increases in debt balances primarily relate to the drilling and midstream expansion programs undertaken in  but were partially offset by our debt reductions in november  funded by proceeds from our northeast operations divestiture 

table of contents income taxes years ended december  in thousands income tax expense benefit effective tax rate the provision for income taxes changed dramatically from due to the loss generated by us operations for pretax results for compared with were most significantly influenced by the impairment charges recognized on us oil and gas properties and on our investment in bbep 
also  results included the gain resulting from our divestiture of our northeast operations 
higher canadian pretax income and the absence of tax credits received in increased the provision for income taxes in canada by million 
in  the effective rate exceeds the statutory rate of due to the benefit of lower taxes in canada partially offset by impact of permanent differences for executive compensation and meals and entertainment 
income tax expense for was million which yielded the effective rate of 
the basis point increase in the effective rate is principally due to taxes on the gain associated with the divestiture of our northeast operations at the us statutory rate  which is higher than the comparable canadian rate 
thus our taxable income was more heavily weighted toward the usin compared with also  the recognition in of tax expenses pursuant to fin and a decrease in the tax credits generated by our canadian operations increased the effective rate  offset in part by a reduction for the effect of a future tax rate reduction in canada 
our us income tax expense of approximately was established using the statutory us federal rate of plus the effects of the texas margin tax that was enacted in may our canadian tax expense was established using the combined federal and provincial rate of and the effects of tax rate reductions that were enacted in liquidity  capital resources and financial position cash flow activity operating cash flows years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  an increase of million or from the increase in operating cash flows results from a production increase and a increase in realized price per mcfe 
payments of million for income taxes and other uses of working capital partially offset the increase in cash earnings 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million  an increase of million or from the cash flows increased due to a production increase  an realized price increase and higher cash flows provided by working capital 

table of contents investing cash flows years ended december  in thousands purchases of property  plant and equipment alliance acquisition return of investment from equity affiliates proceeds from sales of properties equipment net cash used by investing activities for each of the three years ended december   we have spent significant cash resources for the development of our large acreage positions in our core areas in the fort worth basin and the cbm properties in alberta 
in addition  our expenditures for gas processing and gathering assets have grown significantly as part of our growth in the barnett shale 
in and  our investing cash flows included the billion cash portion of the alliance acquisition and net cash proceeds of million from the divestiture of our northeast operations  respectively 
of the billion of cash paid for property  plant and equipment during  was invested in our oil and natural gas properties and was invested in our gas processing and gathering operations 
our purchases of property  plant and equipment reflect our expansion in our two core operating areas  the fort worth basin and the western canadian sedimentary basin in alberta 
in  we purchased approximately producing wells in the alliance acquisition and drilled net wells in the fort worth basin and net wells in canada 
additionally  the assets purchased in the alliance acquisition included a gathering system and we invested million and million for fort worth basin and canadian gas processing and gathering facilities  respectively 
capital costs incurred for development  exploitation and exploration activities in were million  primarily for expansion in our two core operating areas 
in  we drilled net wells in the fort worth basin and an additional net wells in canada 
additionally  we invested million and million for fort worth basin and canadian gas processing and gathering facilities  respectively 
capital costs incurred for development  exploitation and exploration activities in were million 
those expenditures also reflect our two core operating areas 
in  we drilled net wells in the fort worth basin and an additional net wells in canada 
additionally  we invested million and million for fort worth basin and canadian gas processing and gathering facilities  respectively 
we currently estimate that our spending for property  plant and equipment in will be approximately million  of which we have allocated million for drilling activities  million for gathering and processing facilities including million to be funded directly by kgs  million for acquisition of additional leasehold interest and million for other property and equipment 

table of contents financing cash flows years ended december  in thousands cash flow provided by financing activities issuance of debt repayments of debt debt issuance costs minority interest contributions minority interest distributions proceeds from exercise of stock options excess tax benefit on exercise of stock options purchase of treasury stock net cash provided used by financing activities net cash flows from financing activities during were significantly impacted by the alliance acquisition and our capital program 
we funded our capital program in excess of operating cash flow through the issuance of our senior notes and additional borrowing under our senior secured credit facility 
the alliance acquisition was funded by a million five year senior secured second lien facility and additional borrowing under our senior secured credit facility 
net cash flows from financing activities during were significantly impacted by the kgs ipo and the divestiture of our northeast operations 
the kgs ipo resulted in cash proceeds of million primarily used to repay debt 
the divestiture of our northeast operations generated net cash proceeds of million included in investing activities  however those proceeds were used to pay down debt previously outstanding which affected financing cash flows 
liquidity and borrowing capacity on february   we extended our senior secured credit facility to february  the facility provides for revolving loans  swingline loans and letters of credit from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed the borrowing base which is calculated based on several factors 
as of december   the borrowing base was equal to billion  and is subject to annual redeterminations and certain other redeterminations 
the lenders agreed to provide billion of revolving credit commitments and the company has an option to increase the facility to billion 
the lenders commitments under the facility are allocated between us and canadian funds  with us currency available for borrowing by the company and either us or canadian currency available for borrowing in canada 
the facility offers the option to extend the maturity up to two additional years with lender approval 
us borrowings under the facility are secured by  among other things  quicksilver s and its domestic subsidiaries oil and gas properties including applicable reserves 
canadian borrowings under the facility are secured by  among other things  all of our oil and gas properties including applicable reserves 
the company also pledged the equity interests in bbep it received as part of the breitburn transaction to secure its obligations under the senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility contain covenants that are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
at december   approximately million was available for borrowing under our senior secured credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants 
as of january   we had borrowed an additional million under the credit facility 
our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control  including market prices for our products 
any future inability to comply with these 
table of contents covenants  unless waived by the requisite lenders  could adversely affect our liquidity by rendering us unable to borrow further under our credit facilities and by accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness 
in connection with the kgs ipo  kgs entered into a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility kgs credit agreement 
in october  the lenders increased the facility to million 
additionally  the revised kgs credit agreement features an accordion option of million that allows for the facility to increase to million upon lender approval 
kgs must maintain certain financial ratios that can limit its borrowing capacity 
the kgs credit agreement contains covenants that are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
at december   kgs borrowing capacity was million  and kgs had million in borrowings outstanding under the kgs credit agreement 
kgs was in compliance with all covenants as of december  kgs s ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control 
any future inability to comply with these covenants  unless waived by the requisite lenders  could adversely affect our liquidity by rendering kgs unable to borrow further under its credit facility and by accelerating the maturity of its indebtedness 
as of december   and  our total capitalization was as follows years ended december  in thousands long term and short term debt senior secured credit facility senior secured second lien facility senior notes senior subordinated notes convertible subordinated debentures kgs credit agreement various loans total debt stockholders equity total capitalization we believe that our capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of our existing business 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure budget of approximately million will be funded by cash flow from operations  including application of anticipated income tax refunds and cash distributions received from bbep 
we may  from time to time during  make borrowings under the credit facility  but expect that for all of to require no incremental borrowings from ending levels 
depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors  we will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities  other possible capital markets transactions or the sale of assets  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
we will also consider from time to time additional acquisitions of  and investments in  assets or businesses that complement our existing asset portfolio 
acquisition transactions  if any  are expected to be financed through cash on hand and from operations  bank borrowings  the issuance of debt or other securities or a combination of those sources 
financial position the following impacted our balance sheet as of december   as compared to our balance sheet as of december  our accounts receivable balance increased million primarily as a result of accrual for the refund of us federal income taxes paid in for the tax year 
the refund is the result of incurring a loss for the tax year 

table of contents our current and deferred derivative assets increased million and million  respectively  as our current and deferred derivative obligations decreased million and million  respectively 
our current derivative obligations include the million fair value loss for the remaining term of the michigan sales contract 
additionally  our current deferred income tax asset decreased million and our current deferred income tax liability increased million as a result overall higher valuations of our derivative valuations 
investments in equity affiliates decreased primarily due to the recognition of a million impairment of our investment in bbep during the billion increase in our net property  plant and equipment resulted primarily from billion in capital expenditures for development  exploitation and exploration of our existing oil and gas properties and expansion of our gas processing and gathering assets in addition to the billion of oil and gas properties and gathering assets purchased in the alliance acquisition 
offsetting these increases were the million impairment of our us oil and gas properties and ongoing dd a 
long term debt increased due to borrowings needed to fund the alliance acquisition and our capital program 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations

as of december   our outstanding indebtedness included million outstanding under our senior secured credit facility  million under our senior secured second lien facility  million of senior notes  million of senior subordinated notes  million of convertible debentures and million outstanding under the kgs credit facility all before discount 
based upon our debt outstanding and interest rates in effect at december   we anticipate interest payments  including our scheduled interest obligations of million  to be approximately million in although we do not expect year over year increased borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during  should we be required to increase those borrowings and based on interest rates in effect at december   an additional million in borrowings would result in additional annual interest payments of approximately million 
if the borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility were to be fully utilized by year end at interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that interest payments would increase by approximately million 
if interest rates on our december  
table of contents variable debt balance of billion increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual pretax income would decrease or increase by million 
scheduled interest obligations 
as of december   we had scheduled interest payments of million annually on our million of senior notes due july   million annually on our million of senior subordinated notes due march  and million annually on our million of contingently convertible debentures due november  transportation contracts

total remaining cash obligations for such items were million  including million of goods and services recognized during the corvette plant was placed into service during the first quarter of natural gas supply contract 
during  we determined we would no longer deliver a portion of our natural gas production to supply the contractual volumes under the michigan sales contract 
we recorded a loss of million for the fair value of the remaining contractual volumes during at december   we had a remaining liability of million covering the remaining volumes under the contract that ends march  drilling rig contracts

the recorded assets and liabilities associated with our derivative obligations were estimated based on published market prices of commodities for the periods covered by the contracts 
these amounts do not necessarily reflect the payments that will be made to settle these obligations 
unrecognized tax benefits

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
full cost ceiling calculations policy description we use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the development  exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities  but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the application of the full cost method generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to its alternative  the successful efforts method 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
excluded from amounts subject to depletion are costs associated with unevaluated properties 
under the full cost method  net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost reduced by the related net deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of i estimated future net revenue  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on unescalated year end prices and costs  adjusted for contract provisions  financial derivatives that hedge the company s oil and gas revenue and asset retirement obligations  ii the cost of properties not being amortized  iii the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized less iv income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax bases of the oil and gas properties 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the cost center ceiling limitation  a non cash impairment charge is required 

table of contents judgments and assumptions the discounted present value of future net revenue for our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of reserve estimation requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
in the past five years  annual revisions to our reserve estimates  which have been both increases and decreases in individual years  have averaged approximately of the previous year s estimate excluding revisions due to price changes 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a ceiling test related impairment 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling limitation  estimation of proved reserves is also a significant component of the calculation of depletion expense 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of natural gas  ngl and crude oil reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation requires that a discount factor be used and that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
therefore  the future net revenue associated with the estimated proved reserves is not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
rather  they are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each period when the ceiling calculation is performed 
in calculating the ceiling  we adjust the period end price by the effect of derivative contracts in place that hedge future prices 
this adjustment requires little judgment as the period end price is adjusted using the contract prices for such hedges 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable year are held constant indefinitely  and requires a discount factor  the resulting value is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves or the oil and gas properties 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
at any period end  prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our long term price forecast 
also  marginal borrowing rates may be well below the required used in the calculation 
rates below  if they could be utilized  would have the effect of increasing the otherwise calculated ceiling amount 
therefore  oil and gas property ceiling test related impairments that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
oil and gas reserves policy description proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  which do not include financial derivatives that hedge our oil and gas revenue 
our estimates of proved reserves are made and reassessed at least annually using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
revisions may result from changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 

table of contents judgments and assumptions all of the reserve data in this annual report are based on estimates 
estimates of our crude oil  natural gas and ngl reserves are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil  natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered 
estimates of proved crude oil  natural gas and ngl reserves significantly affect our depletion expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the depletion rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
derivative instruments policy description we enter into financial derivative instruments to mitigate risk associated with the prices received from our production 
we may also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our outstanding debt 
we account for our derivative instruments by recognizing qualifying derivative instruments on our balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings during the period in which the hedged transactions are realized 
gains or losses on qualified derivative instruments terminated prior to their original expiration date are deferred and recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring  the deferred gain or loss would be immediately recorded to earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge relationship is recognized currently as a component of other revenue 
the fair value of our natural gas derivatives and associated firm sales commitments as of december  was estimated based on published market prices of natural gas for the periods covered by the contracts 
estimates were determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and commitment and market prices for future periods  to the volumes stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated value of future cash flow streams 
these estimated future cash flow values were then discounted for each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives to arrive at estimated fair value 
judgments and assumptions the estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
valuations are based upon multiple factors such as futures prices  volatility data from major oil and gas trading points  time to maturity and interest rates 
we compare our estimates of fair value for these instruments with valuations obtained from independent third parties and counterparty valuation confirmations 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results 
stock based compensation policy description sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value 
judgments and assumptions option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and 
table of contents judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
income taxes policy description deferred income taxes are established for all temporary differences between the book and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax balances must be adjusted to reflect tax rates that we expect will be in effect during years in which we expect the temporary differences will reverse 
canadian taxes are computed at rates in effect in canada 
us deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on profits that are expected to be permanently reinvested in canada and thus are not considered available for distribution to us 
net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for recoverability  and if necessary  are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
judgments and assumptions we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement 
to the extent that we believe that a more than probability exists that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed and consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit 
evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about our current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to the company 
to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or changed during any period  we would recognize expense or benefit within our consolidated tax expense
