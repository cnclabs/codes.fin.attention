table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of data driven and transaction based marketing and customer loyalty solutions 
we offer a comprehensive portfolio of integrated outsourced marketing solutions  including customer loyalty programs  database marketing services  marketing strategy consulting  analytics and creative services  permission based email marketing and private label retail credit card programs 
we focus on facilitating and managing interactions between our clients and their customers through a variety of consumer marketing channels  including in store  catalog  mail  telephone and on line 
we capture data created during each customer interaction  analyze the data and leverage the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers  as well as to enhance customer loyalty 
we believe that our services are becoming increasingly valuable as companies continue to shift their marketing resources away from traditional mass marketing campaigns toward more targeted marketing programs that provide measurable returns on marketing investments 
we operate in the following business segments loyalty services  epsilon marketing services  private label credit and private label services 
loyalty services 
the loyalty services segment generates revenue primarily from our coalition loyalty program in canada 
in our air miles reward program  we primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and  in limited circumstances  the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of loyalty services revenue and indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued reflects the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors  who pay us a fee per air miles reward mile issued 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represent future revenue and earnings for us 
the revenue related to the service element of the air miles reward miles which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors is initially deferred and amortized over a period of months  which is the estimated life of an air miles reward mile  beginning with the issuance of the air miles reward mile and ending upon its expected redemption 
air miles reward miles redeemed redemptions show that collectors are redeeming air miles reward miles to collect the rewards that are offered through our programs  which is an indicator of the success of the program 
we also recognize revenue from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
the revenue related to the redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the air miles reward miles or over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile in the case of air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unused by the collector base or breakage 
we currently estimate breakage to be of air miles reward miles issued 
there have been no changes to management s estimate of the life of a mile in the periods presented 
our estimated breakage changed from one third to effective june  see note deferred revenue of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our air miles reward program tends to be more resilient to economic swings  because many of our sponsors are in non discretionary retail categories such as grocery stores  gas stations and pharmacies 
additionally  we target the sponsors most loyal customers  who we believe are unlikely to significantly change their spending patterns 
we are impacted by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 

table of contents epsilon marketing services 
epsilon marketing services is a leader in providing integrated direct marketing solutions that combine database marketing technology and analytics with a broad range of direct marketing services 
epsilon marketing services has over clients  primarily in the financial services  specialty retail  hospitality and pharmaceutical end markets 
private label services 
the private label services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of statements generated  customer calls handled  remittance processing  customer care and various marketing services 
statements generated represent the number of statements generated for our credit cards 
the number of statements generated in any given period is a fairly reliable indicator of the number of active account holders during that period 
companies are increasingly outsourcing their non core processes such as billing and customer care 
the private label services segment is primarily affected by those industry trends that affect our private label credit segment as discussed below 
private label credit 
the private label credit segment provides risk management solutions  account origination and funding services for our more than private label retail and co branded credit card programs 
private label credit primarily generates revenue from securitization income  servicing fees from our securitization trusts and merchant discount fees 
private label credit sales and average managed receivables are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
private label credit sales this represents the dollar value of private label retail card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites 
generally  we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our program 
private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card banks 
average managed receivables this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders at the beginning of each month during the period in question 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that drive the outstanding balances  such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
the private label credit segment is affected by increased outsourcing in targeted industries 
the growing trend of outsourcing private label retail card programs leads to increased accounts and balances to finance 
we focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub prime borrowers 
additionally  economic trends can impact this segment 
interest expense is a significant component of operating costs for the securitization trusts 
corporate other 
this includes corporate overhead which is not allocated to our segments  as well as all other immaterial businesses 
when there are areas in our business units that no longer align with our strategy  we may explore the sale of those assets 
on november  we sold ads mb corporation  which operated our mail services business 
these mail services included personalized customer communications and intelligent inserting and commingling capabilities for clients in the financial services  healthcare  retail  government and utilities end markets 
in march  we determined that our merchant services and utility services businesses were not aligned with our long term strategy and committed to a disposition plan for these businesses 
in may  we sold our merchant services business  in july  we sold the majority of our utility services business  and in february  we completed the sale of the remainder of our utility services business 

table of contents outlook despite the difficult current macro environment  we expect solid growth to continue during we expect that loyalty services will have growth  in local currency  in revenue and adjusted ebitda in the mid teens  more in line with its historical growth rates 
we expect relationships with our sponsors to expand and grow  while adding new sponsors and expanding into new categories 
however  we expect that our results will be negatively impacted by changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
we expect epsilon marketing services will have growth rates in revenue and adjusted ebitda in a similar range as achieved during  as the demand for database  analytics and interactive services should continue 
for private label credit  we expect credit losses to average approximately  in line with expected unemployment rate movement 
however  we expect to mitigate the impact of higher credit losses with portfolio growth from signings coupled with the benefit of a lower cost of funds as spreads continue to narrow in in addition  we expect strong cash flow generation  with capital expenditures of approximately of revenue 
we also expect our earnings per share to benefit from the share repurchase programs 
overall  we expect to see moderate adjusted ebitda growth overall  despite the difficult macro environment

discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our judgments and 
table of contents estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
securitization of credit card receivables 
we utilize a securitization program to finance a majority of the credit card receivables that we underwrite 
we use our off balance sheet securitization program to lower our cost of funds and more efficiently use capital 
in a securitization transaction  we sell credit card receivables originated by our private label credit segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables  an equity interest in the trust  an interest in the receivables and retained interests in our subordinated notes 
our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis 
the securitization trusts are deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities under gaap and are appropriately not included in our consolidated financial statements 
our interest in our securitization program is represented on our consolidated balance sheets as seller s interest our interest in the receivables and due from securitizations our retained interests and credit enhancement components 
the trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions 
the proceeds from the bonds and other debt are used to fund the receivables  while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs 
the excess spread is remitted to us as securitization income 
our residual interest  often referred to as an interest only strip  is recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our interest only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we will receive over the estimated life of the receivables  which ranges from months to months 
this anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond and note holders  estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses 
because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets  we estimate the fair value of the interest only strip primarily based upon discount  payment and default rates  which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest only strip 
the fair value of the interest only strip  and the corresponding gain or loss  will be impacted by the estimated excess spread over the following two or three quarters 
the excess spread is impacted primarily by finance and late fees collected  net charge offs and interest rates 
changes in the fair value of the interest only strip are reflected in our financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark to market changes of our residual interest 
in recording and accounting for interest only strips  we make assumptions about rates of payments and defaults that we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value 
due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions  the actual rates of principal payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates  and these differences could sometimes be material 
if actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed  the value of the interest only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value would be recorded in earnings 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip  the impact could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  a change in the net charge off rate assumption for our securitized credit card receivables could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the value of the interest only strip as of december  we also retain certain subordinated beneficial interests in our securitized assets  primarily class m  class b and class c notes issued by the securitization trusts as well as seller s interest 

table of contents seller s interest ranks pari passu with investors interests in the securitization trusts and is carried on our consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair values 
changes in the fair values of our seller s interest are recorded through securitization income and finance charges  net  on our consolidated statements of income 
we determine the fair value of our seller s interest through discounted cash flow models 
the estimated cash flows used include assumptions related to rates of payments and defaults  which reflect economic and other relevant conditions 
the discount rate used is based on an interest rate curve that is observable in the market place plus a credit spread 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of seller s interest  it could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example a change in the net charge off rate assumption could have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the value of the seller s interest as of december  our retained interests are classified as available for sale investment securities and are carried on our consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair values 
changes in the fair values of these notes are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the fair value of these securities are estimated utilizing discounted cash flow models  where the interest and principal payments are discounted at assumed current market rates for the same or comparable transactions 
in doing these valuations  management makes certain assumptions about the credit spreads the market participants would demand on the same or similar investments given the currently inactive market for credit card asset backed securities 
assumed discount rates are derived from indicative pricing observed in the most recent active market for such instruments  adjusted for changes occurring thereafter in relative credit spreads and liquidity risk premiums 
if management used different assumptions in estimating the value of our retained interests  it could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  a change in the discount rate could have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the value of the retained interest as of december  see note securitization of credit card receivables of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we recognize the implicit forward contract to sell new receivables during a revolving period at its fair value at the time of sale 
the implicit forward contract is entered into at the market rate and thus  its initial measure is zero at inception 
in addition  we do not mark the forward contract to fair value in accounting periods following the securitization because management has concluded that the fair value of the implicit forward contract in subsequent periods is not material 
we believe that servicing fees received represent adequate compensation based on the amount currently demanded by the marketplace 
additionally  these fees are the same as would fairly compensate a substitute servicer should one be required and  thus  we neither record a servicing asset nor servicing liability 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components based on the relative fair value of the related element redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or  for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption 
under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 

table of contents the amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile of months and a breakage rate of subsequent to june  and one third for previous periods presented 
in may  we secured a comprehensive long term renewal and expansion agreement with bank of montreal as a sponsor in the air miles reward program  pursuant to which bank of montreal transferred to us the responsibility of reserving for costs associated with the redemption of air miles reward miles issued by bank of montreal as a sponsor 
we received million for the assumption of this liability 
historically  air miles reward miles issued by bank of montreal have been excluded from our estimate of breakage as bank of montreal had the responsibility of redemption  and therefore no breakage estimate was required 
however  changing the nature of our agreement required us to include these miles in our analysis  which impacted both the redemption rate and our estimate of breakage 
after evaluating the impact of this transaction  we adjusted our estimate of breakage from one third to 
the decline in the breakage rate assumption was due to greater redemption activity by collectors who use bank of montreal credit cards 
the change in estimate had no impact on the total redemption liability  but reduced the amount of deferred breakage within the redemption liability that is expected to be recognized over the expected life of the air miles reward mile 
breakage and the life of an air miles reward mile is based on management s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis  current run rates and other pertinent factors 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage are actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
we believe that the issuance and redemption of air miles reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors  the type of rewards offered  the overall health of the canadian economy  the nature and extent of air miles reward program promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs 
these influences will primarily affect the average life of an air miles reward mile 
we do not believe that the estimated life will vary significantly over time  consistent with historical trends 
the shortening of the life of an air miles reward mile would accelerate the recognition of revenue and may affect the breakage rate 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue related to the air miles reward program that will be recognized in the future

stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
we used a binomial lattice option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables included our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimated the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimated the volatility of our common stock by using an implied volatility 
we based the risk free interest rate that we used in the option pricing model on a forward curve of risk free interest rates based on constant maturity rates provided by the us treasury 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we used historical data to estimate pre vesting 
table of contents option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
no options were issued during if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense  the future periods may differ from what we have recorded in the current period and could affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
see note stock compensation plans of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas no 
r disclosures 
income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fin no 

the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of  and guidance surrounding  income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
see note income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding fin no 
inter segment sales our private label services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to our private label credit segment 
for this  our private label services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin 
the margin is based on current estimated market rates for similar services 
this fee represents an operating cost to the private label credit segment and corresponding revenue for our private label services segment 
inter segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation 
revenues earned by our private label services segment from servicing our private label credit segment  and consequently paid by our private label credit segment to our private label services segment  are set forth under eliminations in the tables presented in the annual comparisons in our results of operations 
use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to income from continuing operations  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus stock compensation expense  provision for income taxes  interest expense  net  fair value loss on interest rate derivative  loss on the sale of assets  merger and other costs  depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles 
we use adjusted ebitda as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management 
adjusted ebitda is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets  the impact of related impairments  as well as asset sales through other financial measures  such as capital expenditures  investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the non cash effect of stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted ebitda provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations 
therefore  we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall

table of contents revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period in due to the following loyalty services 
revenue increased million  or  to million due to strong organic growth 
our air miles reward program growth was driven by an increase in redemption revenue of million related to a increase in the redemption of air miles reward miles 
issuance revenue increased million related to growth in issuances of air miles reward miles as the program continues to benefit from the ramp up of new sponsors and the expanded commitment from existing sponsors 
additionally  loyalty services experienced increases in commission revenue of million due to growth in the program and investment revenue of million due to the increase in our redemption settlement assets 
within our revenue increase  changes in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar on a full year basis had a minimal impact on revenue for the air miles reward program 
epsilon marketing services 
revenue increased million  or  to million due to an increase of million in revenue from strategic database services and interactive services permission based email 
this increase was generated through a combination of new client signings as well as organic growth as we continued to provide additional services to our existing clients 
this growth was partially offset by declines in revenue of million related to our data products and our direct mail services which were impacted by lower volumes 
private label services 
revenue increased million  or  to million due to an increase in servicing revenue of million as the impact of the loss of the lane bryant portfolio was offset by higher pricing 
additionally  revenue attributable to our marketing programs decreased million primarily due to the non renewal of an expiring contract with an existing client 
private label credit 
revenue decreased million  or  to million due to an decrease in securitization income and finance charges  net  resulting from a combination of higher credit losses of approximately basis points  a lower collected yield of approximately basis points  an improvement of approximately basis points in cost of funds and the loss of the lane bryant portfolio 
corporate other 
revenue decreased million  or  to million due to the loss of revenue from our mail services business of million which  was sold on november  this decrease was offset by revenue of million for transition services provided to the acquirers of our utility and merchant services businesses 
adjusted operating expenses 
for purposes of the discussion below  total adjusted operating expenses excludes stock compensation expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  loss on sale of assets  merger and other costs 
total adjusted operating expenses increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million during the comparable period in adjusted ebitda margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period in loyalty services

asset quality our delinquency and net charge off rates reflect  among other factors  the credit risk of our private label credit card receivables  the average age of our various private label credit card account portfolios  the success of our collection and recovery efforts  and general economic conditions 
the average age of our private label credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio 
we continue to focus resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts and on collections and post charge off recovery efforts to minimize net losses 
an older private label credit card portfolio generally drives a more stable performance in the portfolio 
at december   of our managed accounts with balances and of managed receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than months old 
at december   of our managed accounts with balances and of managed receivables were for accounts with origination dates greater than months old 
delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
when an account becomes delinquent  we print a message on the cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house efforts  we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts

liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
we have historically generated cash flows from operations  although that amount may vary based on fluctuations in working capital and the timing of merchant settlement activity 
our operating cash flow is seasonal  with cash utilization peaking at the end of december due to increased activity in our private label credit segment related to holiday retail sales 
we generated cash flow from operating activities of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in operating cash flow was a result of changes related to merchant settlement activity 
merchant settlement activity is driven by the number of days of float at the end of the period 
for these purposes float means the difference between the number of days we hold cash before remitting the cash to our merchants and the number of days the card associations hold cash before remitting the cash to us 
additionally  we acquired million in credit card portfolios  of which million related to the purchase of the hsn portfolio 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase to deferred revenue as a result of a change in the contractual terms with bank of montreal  in which we assumed their liability for the cost of redemptions for their outstanding air miles reward miles 
we received million in cash for the assumption of this liability which we placed in our redemption settlement asset account

securitizations and receivables funding 
we generally fund private label credit card receivables through a securitization program that provides us with both liquidity and lower borrowing costs 
as of december   we had over billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread accounts and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is funded through the use of certificates of deposit issued through our subsidiary  world financial network national bank 
net securitization and credit card receivable activity utilized million for the year ended december  compared to million in we intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the prior year 
capital expenditures have typically averaged approximately of annual revenue 
during  as certain office relocations and the disposition of certain non core businesses have been completed  we anticipate that capital expenditures will continue to decrease to approximately of annual revenues

liquidity sources 
in addition to cash generated from operating activities  our primary sources of liquidity include securitization program  certificates of deposit issued by world financial network national bank and world financial capital bank  our credit facility and issuances of equity securities 
in addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current facilities  we are also seeking new sources of liquidity 
certain of the announced government programs  such as the term asset backed securities loan facility  are expected to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and generally improve those market conditions  thus enabling us to replace maturing or short term funding 
we have also expanded our brokered certificates of deposit to supplement liquidity for our credit card receivables 
we believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed above will be sufficient to meet working capital needs  capital expenditures  and other business requirements  for at least the next months 
securitization program and off balance sheet transactions 
since january  we have sold a majority of the credit card receivables originated by world financial network national bank to wfn credit company  llc and wfn funding company ii  llc  which in turn sold them to world financial network credit card master trust  world financial network credit card master note trust and world financial network credit card master trust iii the wfn trusts as part of our securitization program 
in september  we initiated a securitization program for the credit card receivables originated by world financial capital bank  selling them to world financial capital credit company  llc which in turn sold them to world financial capital credit card master note trust 
table of contents the wfc trust 
these securitization programs are the primary vehicle through which we finance world financial network national bank s and world financial capital bank s credit card receivables 
historically  we have used both public and private asset backed securities transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our credit card receivables 
private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset backed securitization transactions 
we have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our portfolio of securitized credit card receivables originated by world financial network national bank and world financial capital bank 
however  certain of these commitments are short term in nature and subject to renewal 
there is not a guarantee that these funding sources  when they mature  will be renewed on similar terms or at all 
due to recent market events  the asset backed securitization market has not been available at suitable volumes and pricing levels 
it is difficult to predict if  or when  asset backed securitization markets will return to their historical capacity and pricing levels 
in september  world financial network credit card master note trust issued million of class a series a asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one month libor plus per year  million of class m series a asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one month libor plus per year  million of class b series a asset backed notes that have an interest rate not to exceed one month libor plus per year and million of class c series a asset backed notes that have a fixed interest rate of per year 
these notes will mature in august these notes are rated aaa through bbb  or its equivalent  by each of standard and poor s and fitch ratings 
in connection with the transaction  world financial network credit card master note trust also entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fix the interest rate on the notes starting at over the two year term of the interest rate swaps

these notes will mature in december these notes are rated aaa through bbb  or its equivalent  by each of standard and poor s and fitch ratings 
as of december   the wfn trusts and the wfc trust had approximately billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread deposits and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the wfn trusts and the wfc trust and by the performance of the private label credit cards in these securitization trusts 
the wfn trusts and wfc trust are required to maintain a credit enhancement level of between and of securitized credit card receivables 
the following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of december  for the wfn trusts and the wfc trust by year thereafter total in millions public notes private conduits total represents borrowing capacity  not outstanding borrowings 
private conduits are typically day facilities which are renewed annually 

table of contents early amortization events are generally driven by asset performance 
the wfn trusts excess spread has not deteriorated in as increased losses have been offset by a significant decrease in short term borrowing rates 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely for an early amortization event to occur due to asset performance 
however  if an early amortization event were declared  the trustee of the particular securitization trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the securitization investors were fully repaid 
the occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional receivables 
certificates of deposit 
we utilize certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our credit card bank subsidiaries  world financial network national bank and world financial capital bank 
world financial network national bank and world financial capital bank issue certificates of deposit in denominations of  in various maturities ranging between three months and five years and with effective annual fixed rates ranging from to

we believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation 
for the most part  we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology  as well as decreases in technology and communication costs  to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
our revenues and earnings are favorably affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the third and fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  however  early adoption is not permitted 
retrospective application to all periods presented is required except for instruments that were not outstanding during any of the periods that will be presented in the annual financial statements for the period of adoption but were outstanding during an earlier period 
as a result of the issuance of the convertible senior notes in july  the adoption of fsp apb no 
will have a significant impact on our results of continuing operations beginning january  we expect that net income and earnings per share will be reduced as a result of the adoption of fsp apb no 
 but there will be no impact on the amount or timing of the cash interest payments associated with the convertible senior notes 
we expect to record additional non cash interest expense of approximately million in and from to million in as a result of the adoption of fsp apb no 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf no 

eitf no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  however  early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact that adopting eitf no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued proposed amendments to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas no 
and fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r as exposure drafts 
the proposed amendments would eliminate qualifying special purpose entities qspes from the guidance in sfas no 
currently  a portion of the credit card receivables originated by world financial network national bank or world financial capital bank and ultimately sold to either the wfn trusts or the wfc trust  which are qspes  as part of our securitization program  is not consolidated on the balance sheet of world financial network national bank or world financial capital bank  as applicable  or any of their affiliates  including the company 
the amendments  if adopted as proposed  may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we may lose sales treatment for assets previously sold to the wfn trusts and the wfc trust as well as for future securitizations  which could result in all or some portion of the receivables being consolidated on the balance sheet of world financial network national bank or world financial capital bank  as applicable  or their affiliates  including the company 
it is not clear whether the proposed amendments to sfas no 
and fin no 
r will ultimately be adopted by the fasb and if adopted what form they will take  how they will be implemented  how regulatory authorities will respond or how our bank subsidiaries or we may be affected 
it is possible that these revisions will have an adverse impact on us and our bank subsidiaries 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
sfas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp sfas 
fsp sfas provides clarifying guidance 
table of contents on the application of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  in markets that are not active 
fsp sfas was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the provisions of fsp sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
and fin r fsp and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities 
fsp and fin r require additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and involvement with variable interest entities 
the requirements apply to transferors  sponsors  servicers  primary beneficiaries and holders of significant variable interests in a variable interest entity or qualifying special purpose entity 
disclosures required by fsp and fin r are effective for us as of the year ended december   and have been included in note securitization of credit card receivables of our consolidated financial statements 
because fsp and fin r only requires additional disclosures  the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued no 
eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
fsp eitf 
eitf amends the impairment guidance in eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  to align it with the impairment guidance within statement no 
by removing from eitf the requirement to place exclusive reliance on market participants assumptions about future cash flows when evaluating an asset for other than temporary impairment 
both standards will now require that assumptions about future cash flows consider reasonable management judgment about the probability that the holder of an asset will be unable to collect all amounts due 
fsp eitf applied to our retained interests in securitization trusts and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december  the application of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include off balance sheet risk  interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
off balance sheet risk 
we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  including commitments to extend credit and through our securitization program 
the securitization trusts enter into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions 
the securitization program involves elements of credit  market  interest rate  legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest only strips 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total interest incurred was approximately million for  which includes both on and off balance sheet transactions 
of this total  million of the interest expense for was attributable to on balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables  which are financed off balance sheet 
to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on and off balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  through the securitization trusts  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative 
table of contents purposes 
at december   we had billion of debt  including billion of off balance sheet debt from our securitization program 
as of december  fixed rate variable rate total in millions off balance sheet on balance sheet total at december   our fixed rate off balance sheet debt was locked at a current effective interest rate of through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   our fixed rate on balance sheet debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pre tax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pre tax income of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pre tax income 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
we have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters 
to minimize our risk of loan write offs  we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices 
we monitor the buying limits  as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
we do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary 
a increase in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in an increase in pre tax income of million as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the exchange rate would result in a comparable decrease to pre tax income 
redemption reward risk 
through our air miles reward program  we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards 
to minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs  we have multi year supply agreements with several canadian  us and international airlines  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards  which are typically lower cost per air miles reward mile than air travel  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using air miles reward miles alone  and periodically adjust the number of air miles reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward 
a increase in the cost of redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of million  as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the cost of redemptions would result in a comparable increase to pre tax income
