item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
general the primary objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the wilber corporation and its subsidiaries for each of the years in the two year period ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes presented in part ii  item  of this document 
our financial performance is heavily dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividend income earned on our loans and investment securities less the interest paid on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  investment securities gains losses  service charges on deposit accounts  trust and investment service fees  insurance commission income  the net gain on sale of loans  the increase on the cash surrender value on bank owned life insurance  gain on life insurance  other service fees and other income 
our non interest expenses consist of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  computer service fees  advertising and marketing  professional fees  other miscellaneous expenses and taxes 
results of operations are also influenced by general economic conditions particularly changes in financial markets and interest rates  competitive conditions  government policies  changes in federal or state tax law  and the actions of our regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies 
management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
while management s current evaluation of the allowance for loan losses indicates that the allowance is adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the allowance would need to be increased 
for example  if historical loan loss experience significantly worsened or if current economic conditions deteriorated further  additional provisions for loan losses would be required to increase the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the assumptions and estimates used in the internal reviews of the company s non performing loans and potential problem loans have a significant impact on the overall analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management has concluded that the evaluation of collateral values was reasonable under the circumstances for each of the reported periods  if collateral valuations were significantly lowered  the company s allowance for loan losses would also require an additional provision for loan losses 
our policy on the allowance for loan losses is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of the allowance for loan losses is included in part ii  item ci  of this document 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reader to review each of the policies included in note of the consolidated financial statements provided in part ii  item  of this document to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported

b 
performance overview for the year ended december  during several of our key performance measures decreased as compared to net income  earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity all decreased in specifically  net income decreased from million in to million in  a million or decrease 
earnings per share  return on assets  and return on equity decreased from   and  respectively  in to   and  respectively  in during  net income was negatively affected by significant increases in non interest expense and the provision for loan losses  as well as a decrease in non interest income 
these items were offset  in part by a significant increase in net interest income and lower income taxes 
in  we implemented several aspects of our strategic plan to grow the earning assets of the company 
this included expanding the company s geographic markets into larger  more densely populated markets throughout central and upstate new york state  including the capital district and the greater syracuse  new york marketplace 
accordingly  we established a full service branch office within the capital district  namely our halfmoon office in saratoga county  and opened a representative loan production office in the greater syracuse market  namely our cicero office in onondaga county 
in addition  during we hired new personnel  purchased new computer systems and upgraded our communications infrastructure to support a larger organization  causing a significant increase in non interest expense 
in addition  due to significant growth in loans outstanding  weakening national economic conditions and the related weakening in some of our credit quality metrics  we increased the provision for loan losses by thousand or 
and finally  non interest income decreased thousand between and due principally to various distinct events 
the combination of these factors caused the significant reduction in net income in although we recorded decreases in net income and other earnings performance metrics during  the underlying factors were generally different than the sub prime mortgage related factors that affected many of our peer banks and bank holding companies throughout the united states

financial condition i 
comparison of financial condition at december   and december please refer to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item  of this document 
summary of financial condition at december   we remained a well capitalized financial institution 
we do not originate or hold in the normal course of our business sub prime or alt k 
index a residential mortgage loans or investment securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgage loans  and therefore have not experienced any significant losses due to these practices 
in addition  we monitor our liquidity position on a regular basis and do not unduly rely on the wholesale credit markets for our funding 
the substantial majority of our funding is provided through customer deposits 
we did not experience any material deterioration in our financial condition during due to the national economic crisis or global financial markets crisis 
asset composition our assets are comprised of earning and non earning assets 
earning assets include our investment securities  loans  interest bearing deposits at other banks and federal funds sold 
non earning assets include our real estate and other assets acquired as the result of foreclosure  facilities  equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  non interest bearing deposits at other banks and cash 
we generally maintain approximately to of our total assets in earning assets 
during the composition of our assets changed significantly 
in particular  we significantly increased total loans outstanding due to our market expansion efforts and a significant increase in loan origination personnel 
the total loans to total assets ratio was at december   as compared to at december  total assets total assets increased significantly during due to our expansion into new markets throughout the central and upstate new york marketplace and company wide focus on growth 
total assets increased from million at december  to million at december   a million or increase 
the growth in total assets was principally funded by an increase in deposit liabilities  and  to a lesser extent  borrowings 
during  deposit liabilities increased million or  from million at december  to million at december  on a combined basis  short term and long term borrowings also increased million or between december  and december  as we funded new loans 
investment securities our investment securities portfolio consists of trading  available for sale  and held to maturity securities 
the following table summarizes our trading  available for sale  and held to maturity investment securities portfolio for the periods indicated 
summary of investment securities at december  amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value amortized cost estimated fair value in thousands trading available for sale us treasuries obligations of us government corporations and agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds mortgage backed securities corporate securities equity securities total available for sale held to maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds mortgage backed securities total held to maturity these securities are held by the company for its non qualified executive deferred compensation plan 
certain figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 
k 
index between december  and december   our total investment securities portfolio including trading  available for sale  and held to maturity decreased million or 
during we received proceeds from sales and maturities of securities totaling million  versus new purchases of million 
proceeds from the sale or maturity of holdings in the investment securities portfolio were principally used to purchase new investment securities  and  to a lesser extent  loan growth 
the estimated fair value of the investment portfolio is largely dependent upon the interest rate environment at the time the market price is determined 
as interest rates decline  the estimated fair value of bonds generally increases  and conversely  as interest rates increase  the estimated fair value of bonds generally decreases 
at december   the net unrealized gain on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
by comparison  at december   the net unrealized loss on the available for sale investment securities portfolio was million 
the general level of interest rates was significantly lower at december  due to an ailing economy  as compared to the general level of interest rates at december  this caused the available for sale portfolio to move from a million unrealized loss position at december  to a million unrealized gain position at december  during we continued to maintain a concentration in mortgage backed securities 
these included both mortgage pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
at the end of  our mortgage backed securities portfolio comprised of the carrying value of our investment securities portfolio 
this compares to and at the end of and  respectively 
approximately of our mortgage backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government through a ginnie mae guarantee 
the remaining of our mortgage backed securities portfolio or million at par value are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac  which are government sponsored enterprises 
during fannie mae and freddie mac experienced a significant deterioration in their financial condition 
this prompted the us treasury department to bail out the two enterprises  which  in effect  reaffirmed the implied us government guarantee and supported the aaa rating of our mortgage backed securities holdings 
furthermore  during we did not hold any fannie mae or freddie mac preferred stock or any debt securities that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
the credit quality of our debt securities is strong 
at december   of the securities held in our available for sale and held to maturity investment securities portfolios excluding notes issued directly by the bank to local municipalities were rated a or better by moody s credit rating services  were rated aaa 
this compares to and  respectively  at december  the decrease in aaa rated investment securities was principally due to the downgrade of several municipal investment securities from aaa to aa during  due principally to mono line insurance company downgrades 
obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds credit quality table december  dollars in thousands aaa aa a baa not rated uninsured un enhanced insured enhanced uninsured un enhanced insured enhanced un enhanced enhanced enhanced un enhanced total total aaa total aa total a moody s ratings we purchase our municipal securities based on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing municipality and have not relied on the insurance enhancement attached to the security 
although our mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by us government agencies and us government sponsored enterprises  they are susceptible to prepayment risk 
for example  residential mortgage interest rates dropped significantly in the second half of  which  in turn  may cause the yield on our mortgage backed securities to decline in when mortgage rates are low  homeowners often refinance their existing mortgage loans or purchase new homes 
this increases the amount of principal payments we receive on our mortgage backed securities  which  in turn  k 
index increases the amount of net amortization expense we record as an offset to interest income  thereby decreasing the yield on these securities 
the following table sets forth information regarding the carrying value  weighted average yields and anticipated principal repayments of the bank s investment securities portfolio as of december  all amortizing security principal payments  including collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage pass through securities  are included based on their expected average lives 
callable securities  primarily callable agency securities  and municipal bonds are assumed to mature on their maturity date 
available for sale securities are shown at fair value 
held to maturity securities are shown at their amortized cost 
the yields on debt securities shown in the table below are calculated by dividing annual interest  including accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums  by the amortized cost of the securities at december  yields on obligations of states and municipalities exempt from federal taxation were not tax effected 
investment securities maturity table in one year or less after one year through five years after five years through ten years after ten years total dollars in thousands carrying value weighted average yield carrying value weighted average yield carrying value weighted average yield carrying value weighted average yield carrying value weighted average yield obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal bonds mortgage backed securities corporate securities total securities this table excludes trading securities totaling million and equity securities totaling thousand at december  at december   the approximate weighted average life for all of the bank s available for sale and held to maturity debt securities was years 
by comparison  at december  the approximate weighted average life for the bank s available for sale and held to maturity debt securities was years 
these estimates were provided by a third party investment securities analyst and are used to provide comparisons with other companies in the banking industry 
the estimates were based upon the projected cash flows to the most likely call date of our investment securities portfolio taking into consideration the unique characteristics of the individual securities held by us 
the decrease in the weighted average life of the portfolio between the comparable periods was principally due to an increase in anticipated cash flows from our mortgage backed securities portfolio and an increase in anticipated calls of municipal securities 
our estimate may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to our concentration in mortgage backed securities 
at december   the equity securities in our available for sale portfolio had a fair value of thousand 
by comparison  the market value of this portfolio was thousand at december  due to the pending financial markets crisis and management s desire to retain the bank s equity capital  during the third quarter of we sold most of the common stocks of other banking institutions held in this portfolio 
other investments at december  we held million of non marketable equity securities including million in fhlbny stock  a million equity interest in a small business investment company  meridian venture partners ii  l 
p  thousand of federal reserve bank of new york stock  thousand in new york business development corporation stock  and thousand in a small title insurance agency 
by comparison  at december   the estimated fair value of our non marketable equity securities totaled million  a thousand or net increase between the periods 
due to minimum membership stock requirements  we increased our capital stock in the fhlbny from million at december  to million at december   a thousand increase 
we own common stock of fhlbny which enables us to borrow funds under the fhlbny advance program and qualify for membership 
recent published reports indicate that certain member banks of the federal home loan bank system  which include eleven other regionally based federal home loan banks  may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of one of the banks in the federal home loan bank system  including fhlbny could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  given that there is no market for our fhlbny common stock  we believe k 
index that there is a risk that our investment could be deemed other than temporarily impaired at some time in the future 
in addition  it is possible that the fhlbny will discontinue or suspend its dividend payments to members in the event its regulatory capital levels diminish 
if either of these events occur  it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks in the normal course of business  we sell and purchase federal funds to and from other banks to meet our daily liquidity needs 
we generally target an overnight funds sold position of million to million 
we believe these levels provide us ample levels of short term liquidity to meet loan funding needs and other working capital requirements 
because federal funds sold are generally an unsecured obligation of the counter party  we only sell federal funds to well capitalized banks that carry strong credit ratings 
however  due to the global financial crisis and related tightness in the inter bank credit markets  during the fourth quarter of the federal reserve banks announced a program whereby they would begin to pay interest on members required and excess reserves 
due to the safety of the federal reserve bank of new york  we began leaving excess reserves on deposit  in lieu of selling unsecured federal funds to other commercial banks 
for this reason  at december  we held million in interest bearing balances at other banks versus only thousand at december  due to significant volatility in our daily overnight funds position it is most appropriate to compare our average outstanding balances 
during our average overnight funds position  including federal funds sold and interest bearing balances at other banks  was million or of average total assets 
by comparison  during our average overnight funds position was million or of average total assets 
the slight decrease in our average overnight position between and was due principally to our effort to reduce overnight funds balances as the yield on overnight funds decreased precipitously during loan portfolio general 
the total loan portfolio increased significantly during in line with our strategy to increase the company s earning assets  particularly loans outstanding 
total loans outstanding increased from million at december  to million at december   a million or increase 
during  we continued to expand our geographic market for loans 
in particular  we established a representative loan production office in cicero  new york onondaga county and continued to originate new commercial and residential mortgage loans in saratoga county  a market we entered in we also continued to aggressively market our small business  consumer  and residential mortgage loans in both our core rural markets and more densely populated markets including johnson city  new york broome county and kingston  new york ulster county 
due to these efforts  all categories of loans increased during the following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio over the prior five year period

between december  and december  our commercial real estate portfolio increased million or 
at december   commercial real estate loans comprised of our total loan portfolio 
this compares to at december  throughout the period covered in the table above  we concentrated our efforts on k 
index opening new offices and hiring commercial lenders in large  more densely populated markets 
these efforts also contributed to the increase in the outstanding balances in our commercial loan portfolio 
at december   commercial loan balances outstanding totaled million 
this compares to million at december in addition  during the first quarter of we acquired provantage funding corporation  a new york state licensed mortgage bank headquartered in saratoga county with several offices located in the capital district of new york 
we acquired provantage funding corporation to improve our residential mortgage lending capabilities and increase the outstanding balances in our residential mortgage portfolio 
at december   the outstanding balance of our residential mortgage portfolio was million 
this compares to million at december   a million or increase over the two year period 
during  we competitively priced and marketed our consumer loan products  principally installment type automobile loans  which increased the consumer loan portfolio to million at december  this represents a million or increase over the december  consumer loan portfolio balance of million 
at december   our indirect automobile loan portfolio was comprised of  accounts  totaling million 
this compares to  accounts totaling million at december   an net increase in accounts and a net increase in indirect automobile loans outstanding 
the following table sets forth the amount of loans maturing in our portfolio

index commitments and lines of credit 
standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including bond financing and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby and commercial letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
since most of the standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
at december  and december   stand by and commercial letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   the fair value of the bank s stand by letters of credit was not significant 
the following table summarizes the expirations of our stand by and commercial letters of credit as of december  standby and commercial letters of credit expiration table commitment expiration of standby letters of credit dollars in thousands within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years five years or greater total in addition to standby letters of credit  we have issued lines of credit and other commitments to lend to our customers 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
these include home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans  commercial letters of credit  and other personal and commercial lines of credit 
at december  and december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments of million and million  respectively  representing a million or increase period over period 
the significant increase in the unfunded loan commitments was primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and other construction loans  and to a lesser extent  the unused portion of commercial lines of credit 
asset quality and risk elements general 
one of our key objectives is to maintain strong credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
the following narrative provides summary information and describes our experience regarding the quality and risk elements of our loan portfolio 
delinquent loans 
at december   we had million of loans that were to days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
by comparison  at december  we had million of loans that were to days past due excluding non performing loans 
this equaled of total loans outstanding 
the increase in delinquent loans between the periods was principally due to increases in the level of delinquent loans in the commercial loan portfolio  home equity line of credit portfolio and consumer loan portfolio  offset  in part  by decreases in the commercial real estate and family closed end residential real estate portfolios 
we considered the level of delinquent loans at december  to be manageable and well within management s targeted guideline of less than of loans outstanding 
non accrual  past due and restructured loans 
the following chart sets forth information regarding non performing assets for the periods stated 
k 
index table of non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands loans in non accrual status residential real estate commercial real estate commercial consumer total non accruing loans loans contractually past due days or more and still accruing interest troubled debt restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans includes loans secured by family residential dwellings  family residential dwellings  home equity loans and residential construction loans 
includes commercial and industrial loans  agricultural loans and obligations other than securities and leases of states and political subdivisions in the united states includes properties acquired through foreclosure or similar proceedings 
certain figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 
total non performing loans  including non accruing loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  increased million between december  and december   from million to million 
the increase in non performing loans between the comparable periods were principally due to an increase in commercial real estate and residential real estate loans days past due and still accruing interest 
total loans in non accrual status decreased period over period  from million at december  to million at december  non performing loans were of total loans outstanding at december   as compared to of total loans outstanding at december   a basis point decrease between the periods 
the decrease in non performing loans to total loans was principally due to significant growth in loans outstanding between comparable periods 
the non performing loans were not concentrated in any single industry or closely related group of industries 
we have  however  identified an increase in substandard loans made to borrowers operating in the automotive and other vehicle dealership industry 
impaired loans 
the following table provides information on impaired loans for the periods presented as of and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands impaired loans allowance for impaired loans average recorded investment in impaired loans the level of impaired loans increased from million at december  to million at december  in spite of the increase in total impaired loans  only million of the impaired loans required specific reserve allocations totaling million 
by comparison  at december   million of the impaired loans had a specific reserve allocation of million 
we attribute the decrease in specific reserve allocations to management s general practice of obtaining strong collateral positions in the loans it originates 
k 
index other real estate owned and repossessed assets 
other real estate owned oreo consists of properties formerly pledged as collateral on loans  that have been acquired by us through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
oreo is carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the real estate  less estimated costs to sell 
at both december  and december  we held modest amounts of oreo property totaling thousand and thousand  respectively 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as non performing at some time in the future 
potential problem loans are typically loans classified by our loan rating system as substandard 
potential problem loans may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a rating upgrade of loans previously classified as substandard or a rating downgrade of loans previously carried in a less risky credit classification particularly those with balances in excess of million 
we have identified through normal credit review procedures potential problem loans totaling million or of total loans outstanding at december  by comparison  at december   potential problem loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding 
this represents a million increase in potential problem loans between december  and december  we generally attribute the increase in potential problem loans to the identification of sub standard performance of the operating companies of a few large borrowers and a weakening economy 
management cannot predict economic conditions or other factors that may impact each potential problem loan 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on non accrual status  become restructured  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
loan concentrations 
we classify our loan portfolio by collateral type and industry to determine and monitor the level of our loan concentrations 
we generally consider industry concentrations to exist when the total loan obligations outstanding loans and unfunded commitments to the industry exceed of the bank s tier ii capital 
the bank s tier ii capital at december  was million  which established our industry concentration threshold at million 
we also review the geographic concentration and economic trends within each industry concentration to further segment and analyze the risk 
the following narrative summarizes our concentrations of credit 
at december   we had million in total loan obligations or of the bank s tier ii capital secured by non owner occupied commercial rental properties  including strip malls  office complexes  warehouse  storage  and manufacturing facilities 
at december   the portfolio consisted of approximately loans with an average loan size of thousand 
the geographic locations and types of properties securing this portfolio were very diverse 
two of the loans in this portfolio totaling thousand were classified as substandard at december  at december   we had million in total loan obligations or of the bank s tier ii capital secured by residential rental properties  including family units  family units  and mobile home parks 
at december   the portfolio consisted of approximately loans with an average loan size of thousand 
the geographic locations and types of properties securing this portfolio were fairly diverse 
five of the loans in this portfolio totaling thousand were classified as substandard at december  at december  we had loans with million in total loan obligations to borrowers who operate in the automotive and other vehicle dealership industry 
the total loan obligations to this industry sector represent of the bank s tier ii capital and consists of more than borrowers whose primary revenue is derived from the retail sale and servicing of new and used motor vehicles  motor cycles  and or recreational vehicles 
loans to this industry consist of commercial real estate mortgages  equipment financing  working capital lines of credit  and inventory lines dealer floor plans 
we maintain dealer floor plan lines within this portfolio totaling million  million of which was outstanding at december  due to the significant risk posed by dealer floor plan lending  management monitors the dealer floor plan loans by conducting inventory reviews on a monthly basis 
at december   there were five borrowers within this area of industry concentration with million in aggregate loan obligations outstanding that were classified as substandard 
the substantial majority of our loan obligations in this area of concentration were made to dealerships that primarily sell american automobiles 
in  american automobile manufacturers lost substantial market share to foreign automobile retailers 
at december   we had loans with million in total loan obligations or of the bank s tier ii capital to borrowers who operate in the hotel motel industry  including lodges  bed and breakfast inns  and a limited number of campgrounds and boarding houses 
the single largest borrower has million in total loans outstanding on six separate motel properties 
another twelve borrowers have loans exceeding million 
the hotel motel properties that we finance are geographically dispersed throughout our market area and the broader statewide region 
many of these properties  however  are dependent upon tourism and have a seasonality that peaks in july and august 
at december   million of these loans were deemed to be of acceptable risk pass rated by our k 
index management  with no delinquency noted 
two loans in the hotel motel sector with an outstanding balance of million were risk rated as substandard at december  due to insufficient cash flow generated by the operations of the motels 
at december   loan obligations to the healthcare industry  including hospitals  medical practices  and residential and independent care facilities  totaled million or of the bank s tier ii capital 
this portfolio was comprised of approximately loans with an average size of thousand 
this portfolio presently contains four of the largest borrowers in the bank with loan obligations totaling million 
all of these loans were pass rated at december  and were performing in compliance with contractual terms 
only one loan obligation in this portfolio was identified as substandard at december  the borrower is a small hospital with an unused line of credit totaling thousand 
at december   we had borrowers whose total loan obligations were equal to or exceeded million 
in aggregate  these borrowers total loan obligations were million 
although these large relationships were dispersed among borrowers who operate in various industries  the decline in the financial condition of one of our large borrowers could significantly impact the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
at december   one of our large borrowers  with total loans outstanding of million  was classified as substandard

index there was significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets during turmoil in the energy  housing  and mortgage markets adversely impacted both domestic and global markets and had significant negative impacts on the credit markets  financial institution liquidity and global economic activity 
these market conditions were attributable to a variety of factors  in particular the fallout associated with subprime mortgage loans a type of lending we have never actively pursued 
the disruption has been exacerbated by the continued decline of the real estate and housing market 
while we continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards  in the event that there was a sharp downturn in the housing market in our central and upstate new york market areas  it could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans 
adverse changes in the economy may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely loan payments  which would have a negative impact on our earnings 
an increase in loan delinquencies could adversely impact our loan loss experience  causing increases in our provision and allowance for loan losses in future periods 
during the allowance for loan losses increased thousand or  from million at december  to million at december  during we recorded million in the provision for loan losses  while net loan charge offs totaled thousand 
by comparison  during we recorded thousand in the provision for loan losses and thousand in net charge offs 
the increase in the allowance for loan losses was principally due to significant loan growth in the third and fourth quarters of  a modest deterioration in some of our credit quality metrics and deteriorating economic conditions 
more specifically  due to growth in the loan portfolio and the weakening state of the national economy during the second half of and a decline in some of our credit quality metrics in the fourth quarter of  we significantly increased the provision for loan losses  and in turn  the allowance for loan losses 
in particular  during the second half of we recorded million in the provision for loan losses versus thousand in the first half of  a thousand or increase in the second half of the year 
the allowance for loan losses was million at june  versus million at december   a thousand or increase in the last six months of the year 
the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding was at december  this compares to at december  the basis point decrease in this measure was principally due to significant loan growth in  partially offset by a modest deterioration in credit quality and deteriorating economic conditions 
during we expanded into the greater syracuse and capital district markets of new york 
most of our commercial and consumer real estate loan growth was originated in these new markets with a special focus on credit quality given current economic conditions 
the loans originated in the new markets were originated at lower rates of interest than loans originated in our traditional markets given their lower risk profile 
newly originated loans generally require a lower level of allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans and the non performing loans to total loans both remained relatively stable on a comparable period basis 
in particular  the allowance for loan losses to non performing totaled at december   as compared to at december  the non performing loans to total loans outstanding decreased from at december  to at december  both our management and board of directors deemed the allowance for loan losses adequate at december  and december  allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
we allocate our allowance for loan losses among the loan categories indicated in the following table 
although we estimate and allocate probable losses by category of loan  this allocation should not be interpreted as the precise amount of future charge offs or a proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories 
additionally  since management regards the allowance for loan losses as a general balance  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories

in order to operate the bank on a daily basis  it is necessary for us to maintain a limited amount of cash at our teller stations and within our vaults and atms to meet customers demands 
in addition  we always maintain an amount of check and other presentment items in the process of collection or float 
we are also required to maintain minimum target balances at our correspondent banks 
at december   we maintained million or of total assets in these categories of non earning assets 
this compares to million or of total assets at december  we are also required to maintain a clearing reserve balance at the federal reserve bank of new york and minimum target balances at our correspondent banks 
at december  we also maintained a clearing reserve balance at the federal reserve bank of new york totaling thousand which was included in cash and due from banks 
at december   this clearing balance totaling million was classified in interest bearing balances with banks due to the federal reserve s fourth quarter policy change to pay interest on these balances 
premises and equipment 
the net book value of premises and equipment increased thousand or  from million at december  to million at december  during we opened a full service office in halfmoon  new york saratoga county and a representative loan production office in cicero  new york onondaga county 
the increase in premises and equipment associated with these new offices and other various building improvements and equipment purchases were offset  in part  by depreciation of existing premises and equipment 
bank owned life insurance 
the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance at december  was million  as compared to million at december   a thousand or increase 
during  we recorded a thousand increase in cash surrender of bank owned life insurance 
throughout  the bank held policies on former and current members of the bank s senior management 
the cash surrender value on each policy was increased throughout the year at the net crediting rate applied by the various insurance carriers 
the policies were issued by five life insurance companies who all carry strong financial strength ratings 
the net crediting rates applied on each policy were determined by each insurance carrier based on the performance of their general account 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill was unchanged between december  and december  during we did not acquire any new businesses  nor did we incur any impairment on previous acquisitions 
goodwill totaled million at december  and the current global financial crisis has depressed stock market trading values  particularly those of financial institutions 
as of december   the company s stock price was above the company s book value and therefore no impairment test of goodwill was warranted 
should our common stock value trade consistently below our book value  we would reevaluate the amount of goodwill through an impairment test 
if impairment is warranted  the amount would be recorded through the income statement as a reduction to current period earnings 
k 
index during other intangible assets decreased thousand  from thousand at december  to thousand at december  the decrease was due  in part to the amortization of core the deposit intangible asset recorded in prior period bank branch acquisitions 
in addition  during we sold our ownership interest in mang wilber llc  our former insurance agency subsidiary 
in connection with the sale  we recorded a decrease in the customer list intangible asset associated with prior period agency acquisitions 
pension asset 
at december   our pension plan was over funded due to strong plan asset performance 
more specifically  at december  our pension asset was million 
by comparison  during the investment securities held by the pension plan generated significant losses due principally to the global economic crisis and related financial market performance 
in addition  the plan liability increased between the and plan measurement dates  due to a decrease in the discount rate on plan liabilities 
these conditions prompted us to contribute million toward the plan assets 
in spite of this contribution  at december  the plan was under funded by thousand at december   this amount was recorded as a liability at december  we expect to continue to fund this plan on an as needed basis and do not foresee any issues or conditions that could negatively impact the payment of benefit obligations to plan participants

deposits are our primary funding source 
at december  and december  deposits represented approximately of our total liabilities 
total deposits at december  were million 
this compares to million at december   a million or increase 
the increase in total deposits between december  and december  was attributable to significant increases in money market deposit accounts  now accounts and certificates of deposit over thousand totaling million  as well as modest increases in demand deposits and other deposits totaling million  offset  in part  by decreases in savings accounts and certificates of deposit under thousand totaling million 
during  we successfully marketed our wealth management money market deposit account and attracted new municipal customer deposits increasing outstanding balances in money market deposit accounts  now accounts and certificates of deposit over thousand 
conversely  due to a generally declining interest rate environment we lowered the interest rate paid on savings accounts and retail certificates of deposit  prompting deposit customers to seek out higher yielding alternatives

summary 
net income for was million 
this compares to million in  a million or decrease year over year 
the significant decrease in net income between comparable periods was attributable to a few primary factors  namely a significant increase in total non interest expense  a decrease in total non interest income  and an increase in the provision for loan losses 
more specifically  during we recorded a million increase in non interest expense  a thousand decease in non interest income and a thousand increase in the provision for loan losses 
these reductions in income were offset  in part  by a million increase in net interest income and a thousand decrease in income taxes 
earnings per share decreased from in to in  an per share or decrease 
during  we adopted a strategic plan to accelerate the growth of the company s earning assets  particularly loans 
to fulfill our growth objectives  we expanded into new geographic markets and opened a loan production office in cicero  new york onondaga county in the first quarter of and a full service branch office in halfmoon  new york saratoga county in the second quarter of we also hired additional sales  branch  and operations personnel and outsourced our core computer operating system to accommodate both the current and anticipated growth 
these activities caused a significant increase in total non interest expense 
due to the loan growth and an increase in the associated probable estimated losses in the loan portfolio  it was also necessary to increase the provision for loan losses during  particularly in the second half of the year 
net interest income 
net interest income is our most significant source of revenue 
net interest income is comprised of the interest and dividend income generated on our earning assets  including  but not limited to  loans and investment securities  less interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities  including  customer deposits and borrowings 
during  net interest income comprised of our total revenues net interest income plus non interest income 
the other was due to non interest income 
this compares to and  respectively  for the following asset and yield summary table  interest rate table and rate and volume table and the associated narrative provide detailed net interest income information and analysis that are important to understanding our results of operations 
the following table summarizes the total dollar amount of interest income from average earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense and rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities

average loans include loans held for sale  net deferred loan fees and costs  non accrual loans and excludes the allowance for loan losses 
net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin  also known as the net yield on average interest earning assets  represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
k 
index the level of our net interest income is dependent on several factors including  but not limited to our ability to attract and retain deposits  our ability to generate and retain loans  regional and local economic conditions  regional competition  capital market conditions  the national interest rate environment  as well as our tolerance for risk 
throughout and  our net interest income was affected by all of these factors 
net interest income increased significantly during in particular  we recorded million of net interest income during versus million during the million or increase in net interest income between comparable periods was due to a significant increase in our earning asset balances  in particularly loans outstanding  and substantial reductions in our cost of funding as the level of interest rates dropped throughout the year 
during we recorded million in interest income versus million in  a thousand or increase in spite of significant decreases in the yield on all categories of earning assets 
interest expense  by comparison  decreased million or  from million in to million in during  average earning assets increased million or  from million in to million in  while the average yield on earning assets dropped from in to in the growth in our average earning assets was consistent with our strategic plan to increase the overall earning asset base 
the decrease in our interest expense and cost of funding was principally due to a decrease in the general level of interest rates throughout as the national economy slid into recession 
in spite of decreasing the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings and significantly increasing average loans outstanding  our tax equivalent net interest margin declined between and during  our tax equivalent net interest margin was 
this compares to in  a basis point decrease between comparable years 
the yield on our earning assets decreased basis points between comparable periods  from in to in between september and december  the federal open market committee lowered the target federal funds interest rate by basis points  from to  due to a rapidly slowing national economy 
this  in turn  caused a decrease in the national prime lending rate  an interest rate to which a significant portion of our loan portfolio is indexed 
these actions  along with decreases in other short term interest rates  reduced the yield on all categories of our earning assets between comparable periods  including federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits at other banks  investment securities and loans 
our strategy to grow the earning assets  with a special emphasis on loans  our highest yielding portfolio  counteracted the precipitous drop in earning assets yields 
we recorded million of interest income on loans during  as compared to million in  a thousand or increase despite a basis point decrease in yield between the periods 
the average outstanding balance of our loan portfolio was million in  as compared to million  a million or increase  while loan yields decreased from in to in during  we hired several experienced commercial lenders to staff our cicero  new york loan production office and continued to originate new loans in our core markets and the capital district  which resulted in substantial loan portfolio growth  particularly in the second half of similarly  we recorded an increase in interest income on investment securities despite a drop in interest rates during the substantial majority of our investment securities are fixed rate instruments 
although market interest rates dropped significantly throughout  we only recorded a basis point decrease in yield on our investment securities portfolio  while increasing the average outstanding balance from million in to million in interest income on the investment securities portfolio increased thousand or  from million in to million in due to the combination of these factors 
on a combined basis  we recorded thousand in interest income on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits at other banks during this compares to million in interest income during the decrease in interest income on federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits at other banks between comparable years was principally due to a precipitous drop in market interest rates during we recorded million in total interest expense during  as compared to million during  a million or decrease between the periods 
the significant decrease in market interest rates between comparable periods allowed us to reduce the average rate paid on all categories of our interest bearing liabilities 
between periods  however  the average outstanding balance in savings accounts  the least expensive category of interest bearing deposits  decreased  while the average outstanding balances in time accounts and money market accounts  our more expensive categories of interest bearing deposits  increased 
this change in the composition of interest bearing deposits reduced the potential cost savings of our deposit rate actions between the periods 
k 
index between comparable years  the average rate paid on savings accounts decreased from in to in in addition  due to the low rate of interest offered on savings accounts  the average outstanding balance in savings accounts declined from million during to million during  a million or decrease 
correspondingly  interest expense on savings accounts decreased from thousand in to thousand in the average outstanding balances in now accounts  money market accounts  and time and other deposit accounts all increased between and on a combined basis  the average outstanding balances in these interest bearing deposit categories increased million or despite declining interest rates 
the average rate paid on money market accounts decreased from during to during  but average outstanding balances increased from million to million between these same periods 
we recorded interest expense on money market accounts of million during versus million during  a thousand or decrease between periods 
the increase in money market balances was principally due to growth in municipal customer deposits and significant growth in our wealth management deposit account 
similarly  the average rate paid on time and other deposit accounts decreased from during to during  but average outstanding balances increased from million to million between these same periods 
we recorded interest expense on time and other deposit accounts of million during versus million during  a thousand or decrease between periods 
as market interest rates declined throughout our maturing certificates of deposit were renewed or replaced by new certificates at lower rates of interest 
the increase in the average outstanding balance of time and other deposit accounts was principally due to an increase in certificates of deposit over  held by municipal depositors 
between and  the average outstanding balance of now accounts increased by million or  but the average interest rate paid decreased by only basis points  from during to during as a result of these changes  interest expense on now accounts increased from thousand in to million in  a thousand or increase between comparable periods 
the increase in average outstanding balances between the periods was principally due to an increase in municipal deposits  which was consistent with our strategy to secure more deposits from this customer segment 
interest on borrowings increased from million during to million during  a thousand or increase 
although the average rate paid for borrowings decreased basis points  from to  between comparable periods  interest expense increased due to an increase in the average outstanding balance in borrowings 
to fund long term fixed rate residential and commercial real estate loans  we borrowed long term funds at the fhlbny between periods  resulting in an million net increase in average outstanding borrowings between comparable periods  from million in to million in rate and volume analysis the following table presents changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume change in average balance multiplied by prior year rate  changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and the net change in net interest income

net interest income increased million between and between the periods  we recorded a thousand increase in interest income and a million decrease in interest expense 
the increase in interest income between and was principally driven by a significant increase in the average loan balances outstanding  offset  in part  by a decrease in the yield on all categories of earning assets 
the decrease in interest expense was driven by a reduction in the average interest paid on all categories of interest bearing liabilities  offset  in part  by an increase in the average volume in all categories of interest bearing liabilities except savings accounts 
between and there was a significant drop in the federal funds rate and other market interest rates 
this helped drive a significant reduction in both our earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs  resulting in a million decrease in net interest income due to rate factors 
conversely  our strategy to increase the company s size drove increases in both interest income and interest expense  resulting in a million increase in net interest income due to volume factors 
more specifically  total interest income increased thousand between and due to a significant increase in the volume of earning assets  offset  in part  by a decrease in the average yield on earning assets 
between and the volume of earning assets increased million  which contributed million of additional interest income 
between the same periods  the interest income generated on earning assets decreased million due to rate factors 
throughout and  we focused our personnel and marketing resources on increasing the outstanding balances in our loan portfolio with the goal of increasing interest income 
due to these efforts  we increased the average outstanding balances in our loan portfolio from million during to during the growth in the loan portfolio contributed million of additional interest income between comparable periods 
this improvement  however  was offset by a million decrease in interest income due to a decrease in the average yield on loans between comparable periods as market interest rates dropped 
due to these two factors  the interest income recorded on loans increased thousand between and we recorded a thousand decrease in interest income on federal funds sold between and  due to both rate factors and volume factors 
throughout the first three quarters of  the federal open market committee set the target federal funds rate at 
this was followed by ten separate reductions in the target federal funds rate leaving the target rate at to at december  these actions resulted in an a basis point decrease in the average yield on federal funds sold between and  or a thousand decrease in interest income due to k 
index changes in rate 
in addition the average volume of federal funds sold decreased from million in to million in  causing a thousand decrease in interest income due to volume 
the interest income recorded on the investment securities portfolio increased thousand between and we recorded thousand of additional interest income due to volume factors  offset  in part  by a thousand decrease in interest income due to rate factors 
as we increased deposit liabilities and borrowings between comparable periods  we invested a portion of these funds in investment securities 
these actions reduced slightly the yield on the investment securities portfolio decreased slightly from in to in the average outstanding balances in our interest bearing deposits at other banks increased from million in to million in due to a decrease in short term interest rates between periods  the average yield on this portfolio declined from in to in these factors resulted in a thousand decrease in interest income on this portfolio between the periods 
a thousand decrease in interest income due to a decrease in rate of the portfolio was offset  in part  by a thousand increase in interest income due to volume 
we recorded million in interest expense on time and other accounts during as compared to million during  a thousand or decrease in interest expense between periods 
due primarily to an increase in municipal customer certificates of deposit  the average outstanding balances in time and other deposit accounts increased million between and this increase in the volume of time and other deposit accounts increased interest expense by million between comparable periods 
as short term interest rates dropped in late and  we lowered the interest rates offered on new and renewed certificates of deposit 
these factors decreased interest expense on time and other deposit accounts by million between and interest expense on money market deposit accounts decreased thousand between and as short term interest rates trended downward between june and december  we lowered the interest rate paid on money market deposit accounts 
although this decreased interest expense on money market deposit accounts by million between and  the decrease was offset  in part  by a million increase in interest expense on money market deposit accounts due to volume 
during we decreased the interest rates paid on our statement savings and passbook savings accounts 
the low interest rates offered on these accounts caused a decrease in the average outstanding balances 
these factors resulted in a thousand decrease in interest expense between and  thousand due to rate and thousand due to volume 
between and  the average outstanding balances in now accounts increased million or 
this growth in the volume of the portfolio increased interest expense thousand between comparable years 
however  due to a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on these deposits between and  interest expense on now accounts decreased thousand due to rate 
the increase in interest expense due to these factors totaled thousand between comparable periods 
between the second quarter of and the third quarter of  we secured long term borrowings to fund our long term fixed rate residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans 
the rates of interest on these new long term borrowings were generally slightly less than the rates of interest on maturing long term borrowings  which dropped our average cost on borrowings from in to in interest expense on borrowings  however  increased thousand between comparable years due to an increase in the average volume of borrowings outstanding 
more specifically  between and  an increase in the average volume of borrowings increased interest expense thousand  while the decrease in the average rate paid on borrowings decreased interest expense thousand 
provision for loan losses 
during  we recorded million in the provision for loan losses 
this represents a thousand or increase over the thousand we recorded in the provision for loan losses during the increase in the provision for loan losses between comparable years was principally due to a modest deterioration in most of our credit quality metrics and significant growth in loans outstanding between the periods 
the amount of net charge offs  delinquent loans  non performing loans  impaired loans and potential problem loans increased between december  and december   while the allowance for impaired loans and non performing loans to period loans decreased 
we recorded thousand in net charge offs during versus thousand in net charge offs in net charge offs to average loans outstanding totaled in  as compared to in  a basis point increase 
loans to days delinquent increased from million or of total loans outstanding at december  to million or of total loans outstanding at december  non performing loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding at december   as compared to million or of total loans outstanding at december  this represents a million increase in non performing loans and basis point decrease in non performing loans to total loans outstanding between the periods 
although total impaired loans increased from million at december  to million at december   the allowance for impaired k 
index loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  lastly  potential problem loans increased from million or of loans outstanding at december  to million or of loans outstanding at december due to declining national economic conditions and the continued growth in total loans outstanding  management anticipates recording a significant increase in the provision for loan losses during the first and second quarters of as compared to the comparable quarters in non interest income 
non interest income is comprised of trust fees  service charges on deposit accounts  commission income  net investment security gains  net gain on sale of loans  income and gains on bank owned life insurance  other service fees  gain on sale of insurance subsidiary and other income 
non interest income decreased between and in particular  total non interest income decreased from million in to million in  a thousand or decrease 
the decrease in non interest income between comparable periods was significantly influenced by four distinct events that in total were responsible for an thousand decrease in non interest income between comparable years  offset  in part  by a thousand net increase in other categories of non interest income 
first  during we recorded a thousand gain on the sale of our membership interest in our former insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc 
this positive contribution toward non interest income was offset  in part  by a thousand decrease in commission income due to cessation of insurance sales activities 
was effected by the following three distinct events i a thousand non taxable gain on life insurance coverage due to the unexpected death of a senior executive  ii thousand in flood recovery grant income in connection with certain flood related impairment charges we incurred in  and iii a thousand deferred gain on the sale of our norwich town branch office building and related equipment to the landowner 
in addition to these four distinct events  we recorded a significant increase in service charges on deposit accounts and slight increases in trust service fees  other service fees and the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
these improvements were offset by significant decreases in commission income  net gain on sale of loans and other income 
during we recorded million in service charges on deposit accounts 
this compares to million during  a thousand or increase 
the net increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily due to two factors an increase in penalty charges on checking accounts and an increase in deposit service charges on business checking accounts 
during we began offering our courtesy overdraft service to an increased number of our checking account customers  which caused an increase in the product s usage and increasing penalty charges on checking accounts 
also  in the first quarter of we increased the monthly and per item fees across our business checking account product line 
the commission earned on the sale of insurance policies and products through our former insurance agency subsidiary  mang wilber llc  was recorded in commission income 
in the second quarter of we sold our membership interest in mang wilber llc and effectively exited the insurance sales line of business 
consequently  we did not record any commission income during the second half of  which was the primary reason commission income decreased thousand between comparable years 
during we recorded thousand of commission income  as compared to thousand during during the first quarter of we acquired provantage funding corporation  a new york state licensed mortgage banker  to gain a foothold in the new york state capital district market and provide additional residential mortgage options to our borrowers 
during the third quarter of we merged provantage funding corporation into the company s principal subsidiary  wilber national bank  to improve the overall efficiency of our mortgage origination process 
we now operate provantage funding corporation as a division of wilber national bank 
in the normal course of its business  our provantage home loan division sells a portion of the loans it originates to third party financial institutions

our trading securities portfolio consists of mutual funds and individual equity and debt securities held by the company s executive deferred compensation plan

specifically  we abandoned the development of a branch office in dewitt  new york onondaga county and recorded a thousand expense for site planning  architectural design  and engineering studies in the second quarter of the remaining losses totaling thousand were due to losses incurred on the sale of other real estate owned 
by comparison  during we recorded thousand in losses on the disposal impairment or sale of fixed assets and other real estate due principally to losses recorded on the sale of other real estate 
due to the recent global financial crisis and the related losses incurred by the fdic deposit insurance fund  we were recently advised that during there will be a substantial increase in the fdic insurance premium rates charged to member banks 
based on preliminary estimates  our fdic related expense could increase between thousand and thousand per quarter  or thousand to million annually 
the fdic also approved an interim rule in february that will institute a one time special assessment of cents per of domestic deposits on the banking industry in order to quickly restore its deposit insurance fund 
the fdic s deposit insurance fund reserve ratio is required to be maintained at 
due to the high number of bank failures during  the deposit insurance fund s reserve ratio stood at at december  the company estimates that this one time special assessment that was announced would result in approximately million in additional non interest expense during immediately following the fdic s special assessment announcement several comments were provided by member institutions and banking industry advocates  including the american bankers association  recommending that the fdic consider alternative deposit insurance fund funding options including an increase in the fdic s line of credit with the us department of treasury 
the fdic s chair person followed with a public statement indicating the special assessment could be reduced to basis points if an increase in the line of credit with the us treasury department were granted 
in the event  the special assessment were reduced from basis points to basis points  we estimate that the company would record approximately thousand in additional non interest expense during k 
index income taxes 
income tax expense decreased from million during to million during the decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in income before tax 
our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively

liquidity liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations in the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund our current and planned expenditures 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position 
accordingly  we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis through our daily funds management process 
this includes maintaining the appropriate levels of currency throughout our branch system to meet the daily cash needs of our customers  balancing our mandated deposit or reserve requirements at the federal reserve bank of new york  maintaining adequate cash balances at our correspondent banks  and assuring that adequate levels of federal funds sold  liquid assets  and borrowing resources are available to meet obligations  including reasonably anticipated daily fluctuations 
the following list represents the sources of funds available to meet our liquidity requirements 
our primary sources of funds are denoted by an asterisk 
sources of funding currency federal reserve and correspondent bank balances federal funds sold loan and investment principal and interest payments investment security maturities and calls demand deposits and now accounts savings and money market deposits certificates of deposit and other time deposits repurchase agreements fhlbny advances lines of credit sale of available for sale investment securities brokered deposits correspondent lines of credit federal reserve discount window borrowings sale of loans proceeds from issuance of equity securities branch acquisition in addition to the daily funds management process  we also monitor certain liquidity ratios and complete a liquidity assessment on a monthly basis 
the monthly evaluation report  known as the liquidity contingency scorecard  is reviewed by the asset and liability committee alco and the bank s board of directors 
the report provides management with various ratios and financial market data that are compared to limits established within the bank s asset and liability management policy 
it was designed to provide an early warning signal for a potential liquidity crisis 
based on the limits established in our asset and liability management policy  we determined that at december  and the bank was in a b liquidity position 
based on management s internal rating system  a b liquidity position means management can continue operating the company in the normal course of business  but liquidity risk merits heightened attention 
k 
index the following table summarizes several of our key liquidity measures for the periods stated table of liquidity measures liquidity measure december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents available for sale and held to maturity investment securities at estimated fair value less securities pledged for state and municipal deposits and borrowings total loan to total asset ratio fhlbny remaining borrowing capacity available correspondent bank lines of credit federal reserve bank discount window our overall liquidity position decreased between december  and december  at december  we maintained million in cash and cash equivalents  million in unpledged available for sale at estimated fair value and held to maturity investment securities  and million of readily available lines of credit at other banks to fund any anticipated or unanticipated growth in earning assets 
this compares to million in cash and cash equivalents  million in unpledged available for sale at estimated fair value and held to maturity investment securities  and million of readily available lines of credit at other banks on december  in aggregate  these potential funding sources provided million of short and long term liquidity at december   as compared to million at december   a million decrease between periods 
the decrease in our liquidity is largely due to a significant increase in loans outstanding between periods 
despite our significant loan growth between periods  our total loan to total asset ratios of at december  and at december  were low relative to those of our comparative peer group of financial institutions 
our commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit increased significantly between december  and december  commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit totaled million at december  versus million at december   a million or increase 
the increase between periods was principally due to increases in unused portions of commercial lines of credit and commitments to fund commercial construction loans 
our experience indicates that draws on the commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit do not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and therefore are not expected to materially impact our liquidity prospectively 
on a quarterly basis we prepare a forward looking day sources and uses report to determine future liquidity needs 
based on this report  our deposit retention experience  anticipated loan and investment funding and prepayment activity  the product offerings of our competitors  the level of interest rates  the level of regional economic activity  and our current pricing strategies  we anticipate that we will have sufficient levels of liquidity to meet our funding commitments over the next several quarters prospectively 
although our internal liquidity measurement systems portend adequate amounts of liquidity and we generally rely on customer deposits to fund our operation  during the second half of one of our important funding sources  the fhlbny  experienced a significant decrease in its ability to extend credit to its member banks 
the federal home loan bank system relies heavily on foreign creditors 
due to the global financial crisis  these creditors have withdrawn significantly from the credit market  which has directly affected the fhlbny s ability to provide long term advances loans to its member banks  including us 
historically  we have relied on fhlbny advances to fund select loans and investments 
although we ultimately expect the fhlbny to resume its credit and lending practices  this situation has negatively affected our ability to fund certain aspects of our operation  in particular long term fixed rate commercial and residential loans  at a reasonable cost 
f 
capital resources and dividends the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by our management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is k 
index to provide an adequate return to shareholders while maintaining a sufficient capital base to provide for future expansion and complying with all regulatory standards due to the significant growth in total assets during  total shareholders equity to total assets decreased from at december  to at december  between december  and december   total shareholders equity decreased million or 
total shareholders equity was million at december  as compared to million at december  the net decrease in shareholders equity between periods was due to a few factors  some positive and some negative 
during we recorded net income of million 
we also recorded a million positive change in net unrealized loss on investment securities  net of tax  due to a general decrease in the level of interest rates  and a thousand positive adjustment to retained earnings to recognize the effect of the change in the measurement date of our defined benefit pension plan 
these factors were offset by cash dividend payments totaling million in  a change in the funded status of our defined benefit plan  net of taxes  a change in the net unrealized loss on our split dollar life insurance plan and the adoption of a new accounting standard 
during  our pension plan recorded a significant decrease in the value of its plan assets due to weak capital markets performance  as well as a significant increase in the plan s projected benefit obligation 
this change in the funded status of this plan required us to decrease shareholders equity by million at the end of similarly  we revalued our split dollar life insurance plan at december resulting in a thousand decrease in shareholders equity 
and finally  in the fasb eitf issued new accounting guidance  eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements  that required us to record an estimated liability for our executive split dollar life insurance benefit plan through retained earnings 
accordingly  we recorded a million decrease in retained earnings  due to the adoption of this standard 
the company and the bank are both subject to regulatory capital guidelines as established by federal bank regulators 
under these guidelines  in order to be adequately capitalized the company and the bank must both maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of 
tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity less intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income 
total capital for this risk based capital standard includes tier capital plus allowable portions of the company s allowance for loan losses 
similarly  for the bank to be considered well capitalized  it must maintain a tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of and a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
the company exceeded all capital adequacy guidelines  and the bank exceeded all well capitalized guidelines at december  and december  in addition  the bank s board of directors has established a minimum capital policy that exceeds well capitalized regulatory standards to ensure the safety and soundness of the company s banking subsidiary 
the company s tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets ratio at december  were and  respectively 
this compares to and  respectively  at december  the principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company has been dividends declared and paid to the company by its subsidiary bank 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its subsidiaries  as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
at december   under these statutory limitations  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiary to the company without special regulatory approval was approximately million 
the ability of the company and the bank to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines  and applicable laws

on december   the treasury notified the company that its application to participate in the cpp had been preliminarily approved for million  or approximately of the company s risk weighted assets 
at a special meeting held on february   the company s shareholders approved an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
although the amendment to the certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue preferred stock to the treasury under cpp  a final decision to do so has not yet been rendered
