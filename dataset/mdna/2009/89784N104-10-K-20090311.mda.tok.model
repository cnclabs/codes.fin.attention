table of contents stock based compensation stock options effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the costs are recognized over the period during which an employee or director is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  to measure compensation costs for our stock based compensation programs 
under apb  we recorded no compensation expense for stock options granted to employees and directors if the options strike price was equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
if the option price was below the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date  we recognized compensation expense over the stock option s vesting period 
also  the vesting terms for some stock options granted in were later accelerated which resulted in compensation expense in some cases 
for stock options granted to employees and directors where the options strike price was below the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date  compensation expense was recognized for the difference between the strike price and the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this accounting method  stock based compensation expense considered the unvested portion of all stock options outstanding  calculated using the provisions of sfas no 
as provided for under the modified prospective method  we did not restate our results for the periods prior to restricted stock compensation we recognize restricted stock compensation expense for awards with only service conditions using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the entire award 
the requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award  which often is the vesting period 
if a portion of the restricted stock vests immediately or in another period such that the cumulative vested amount exceeds the cumulative straight line expense amount  we record compensation expense equal to at least the cumulative compensation expense of the vested amount of the restricted stock 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards with performance based conditions is recognized on an accelerated basis using the graded attribution method over the requisite service period 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we establish valuation allowances for tax benefits when we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with fin  we regularly evaluate the likelihood of recognizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances  and 
table of contents information available 
for those benefits that we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained  we recognize the largest amount we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
the adoption of fin had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we record interest and penalties  if any  on any underpayment of income taxes as a component of provision for income taxes and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively
