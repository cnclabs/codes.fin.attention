item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we are a biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of improved next generation protein pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease and serious medical conditions 
we use our molecularbreeding directed evolution technology platform  along with ancillary technologies  in an effort to create improved  proprietary proteins 
our portfolio of next generation product candidates includes maxy g and maxy our maxy g product candidate has been designed to be an improved next generation pegylated  granulocyte colony stimulating factor  or g csf  for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia 
we recently completed a phase iia clinical trial of maxy g in breast cancer patients in eastern europe 
our maxy product candidates are designed to be superior  next generation ctla ig therapeutics for the treatment of a broad array of autoimmune disorders  including rheumatoid arthritis 
in september  we entered into a co development and commercialization agreement with astellas pharma  inc  or astellas  relating to the development and commercialization of our maxy product candidates for autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection 
in addition to our development stage product candidates  we have other  earlier stage programs in preclinical research and assets outside of our core business  including vaccine research and an investment in codexis  inc  a biotechnology company focused on developing biocatalytic process technologies for certain pharmaceutical  energy and industrial chemical applications 
developments in in july  we sold our hematology assets  including maxy vii  our factor viia program  and our assets related to factor viii and factor ix  and granted certain licenses to our molecularbreeding technology platform to bayer healthcare llc  or bayer  for aggregate cash proceeds of million 
we are also eligible to receive future cash milestone payments of up to an additional million based on the achievement of certain events related to the potential initiation of a phase ii clinical trial of maxy vii and the satisfaction of certain patent related conditions associated with the maxy vii program 
our maxy vii product candidate was designed to be a superior next generation factor viia product to treat hemophilia and  potentially  acute bleeding indications 
factor viia is a natural protein with a pivotal role in blood coagulation and clotting 
in september  we entered into a co development and collaboration agreement with astellas pharma inc  or astellas  relating to the development and commercialization of our maxy product candidates for autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection 
under the agreement  we received an upfront fee of million and are eligible to receive future milestone payments totaling million 
astellas will also be responsible for payment of the first million of certain pre clinical development costs that would otherwise be shared by the parties 
in october  we announced plans to delay both phase iii manufacturing activities and a phase iib clinical trial of our maxy g program until we identify a partner who can share these costs 
the phase iii manufacturing costs were anticipated to begin in september  and the delay of this expenditure is expected to have a material impact on the maxy g project timeline 
our original schedule called for the phase iib trial 
table of contents to begin in the second half of we also implemented a restructuring plan that will result in the termination of approximately of our workforce and announced that we would be evaluating potential strategic options  including a sale or disposition of one or more corporate assets  a strategic business combination  or other transactions  and that we had hired a financial advisor to assist us in this process 
in december  we completed a phase iia clinical trial of maxy g in breast cancer patients in eastern europe 
in this phase iia clinical trial  patients were administered a single dose of maxy g therapy per three week chemotherapy cycle  with each patient receiving six cycles of tac docetaxel  adriamycin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy 
the study investigated safety  efficacy and pharmacokinetics of maxy g across the dose range of g kg to g kg 
background to date  we have generated revenues from collaborations with pharmaceutical  chemical and agriculture companies and from government grants and from the sale of certain assets 
revenues from our collaboration agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
astellas was the only collaborative partner that contributed to our collaborative research and development revenues during during and  we also recorded million and  in revenue from related party under our license agreement with codexis 
these revenues reflect amounts due to us from payments received by codexis under its collaboration arrangement with shell oil products us that began in november and an expanded collaboration agreement between royal dutch shell plc and codexis for the development of new enzymes to convert biomass to fuel 
we expect our total revenues to decrease in compared to  primarily due to the million we received from bayer in july in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and grant of certain licenses to our molecularbreeding technology platform 
our revenues may fluctuate substantially from year to year based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements  our receipt of any development related milestones  royalties and other payments under such agreements  or the completion of any strategic transactions 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will enter into any new licensing or collaborative agreements  receive any milestone  royalty or other payments under any existing or future licensing  collaboration or other agreements  whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product or whether we will consummate any strategic transaction 
we have incurred significant operating losses from continuing operations since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have invested heavily in establishing our proprietary technologies 
our research and development expenses for were million  compared to million in and million in we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years and may never achieve sustained profitability 
we continue to maintain a strong cash position to fund our expanded product development efforts  with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd

critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents goodwill impairment statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired  using a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
we operate one reporting unit  that is  our human therapeutics segment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment would then be measured in the second step in which we determine the implied fair value of goodwill based on the allocation of the estimated fair value determined in the initial step to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
in the second quarter of  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test due to the significant decline of our stock price subsequent to the announcement on june  of certain patent matters related to our maxy g product candidate and concluded that the carrying value of the our net assets that is  the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded our fair value  based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
accordingly  we performed the second step  as required by sfas  which indicated that an impairment loss existed because the implied fair value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet was zero 
as a result  we recorded an estimated impairment charge of million in the second quarter of relating to the write off of our goodwill 
we completed our determination of the fair value of the affected goodwill during the third quarter of and concluded that no revision of the estimated charge was required 
no impairment charges were recorded in or source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenues from collaboration agreements as earned upon our achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our corporate collaboration agreements have generally provided for research funding for a specified number of full time equivalent researchers working in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned as the related research work is performed 
in addition  a collaborator may make technology advancement payments that are intended to fund further development of our core technology  as opposed to a defined research program 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
such payments are recognized ratably over the related research and development period 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment and we judge the event to be the culmination of a separate earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on sales to third parties of licensed products 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable upfront payments received in connection with collaboration agreements  including license fees  and technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of the company s core technologies  are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue over the relevant research and development periods specified in the agreement 
under arrangements where the company expects its research and development obligations to be performed evenly over the specified period  the upfront payments are recognized on a straight line basis over the period 
under arrangements where the company expects its research and development obligations to vary significantly from period to period  the company recognizes the upfront payments based upon the actual amount of research and development efforts incurred relative to the amount of the total expected effort to be incurred by the company 
in cases where the planned levels of research services 
table of contents fluctuate substantially over the research term  this requires the company to make critical estimates of both the remaining time period and the total expected costs of its obligations and  therefore  a change in the estimate of total costs to be incurred or in the remaining time period could have a significant impact on the revenue recognized in future periods 
the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables as required under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires management to exercise judgment as to whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the collaborator and to estimate whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
collaborative agreements also may contain multiple deliverables that require management to determine whether or not the deliverables are separate units of accounting 
revenue from license agreements for which no further performance obligations exist is recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or when the amount can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to grant agreements with various government agencies is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred  and when these research and development expenses are within the prior approved funding amounts 
certain grant agreements provide an option for the government to audit the amount of research and development expenses  both direct and indirect  that have been submitted to the government agency for reimbursement 
we believe the overhead rates we used to calculate our indirect research and development expenses are within the contractual guidelines of allowable costs and are reasonable estimates of our indirect expenses incurred through the term of the agreements 
as noted above  we are currently evaluation our strategic options  which may include a sale or disposition of one or more corporate assets  a strategic business combination  or other transactions  if we continue our operations  our sources of potential revenues for the next several years are likely to be license payments and research funding under existing and possible future government research grants and may include research funding and milestone payments under our existing collaboration agreement with astellas or under possible future collaborative arrangements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for clinical trial costs we charge research and development costs  including clinical study costs  to expense when incurred  consistent with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
clinical study costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
most of our clinical studies are performed by a third party contract research organization cro 
the clinical trials generally have three distinctive stages plus pass through costs start up initial setting up of the trial  site and study management of the trial  and close down and reporting of the trial 
we review the list of expenses for the trial from the original signed agreements and separate them into what we perceive as start up  enrollment or closedown expenses of the clinical trial 
the start up costs  which usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and include costs  such as study initiation  site recruitment  regulatory applications and investigator meetings  are expensed ratably over the start up period 
the site management  study management  medical and safety monitoring and data management expenses are calculated on a per patient basis and expensed ratably over the treatment period beginning on the date that the patient enrolls 
the close down and reporting expenses are expensed ratably over the close out period of time 
pass through costs  including the costs of the drugs  are expensed as incurred 

table of contents in general  our service agreements permit us to terminate at will where we would continue to be responsible for payment of all services completed or pro rata completed at the time of notice of termination  plus any non cancellable expenses that have been entered into by the cro on our behalf 
restructuring charges in october  we implemented a restructuring plan that will result in the termination of approximately of our workforce  with staggered terminations through the end of april in addition  in november  we implemented a plan to consolidate our research and development activities at our us facilities in redwood city  california 
the consolidation resulted in the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps  our wholly owned subsidiary in denmark 
in connection with these restructuring and consolidation plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  costs associated with restructuring activities generally have been recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
however  in the case of leases  the expense is estimated and accrued when the property is vacated or at the point when we cease to use the leased equipment 
given the significance of  and the timing of  the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including estimating the salvage value of equipment consistent with abandonment date 
in addition  post employment benefits accrued for workforce reductions related to restructuring activities are accounted for under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas 
a liability for post employment benefits is recorded when payment is probable  the amount is reasonably estimable  the obligation is attributable to employees services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under this restructuring 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
in connection with the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps  we determined that the remaining useful lives of certain of the fixed assets at maxygen aps had been shortened to three months for equipment and to six months for leasehold improvements at november  the remaining book value of these assets was depreciated over the shorter estimated remaining useful lives and the depreciation expense is reflected in research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock options and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and espp shares using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of each award 
we estimate expected volatility and future stock price trends based on historical volatilities 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures  the expected volatility  and a comparison to relevant peer group data 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we have adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized during the years ended december   and include a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 
table of contents accounting for stock based compensation sfas  amortized on a graded vesting basis over the options vesting period  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
under this method of implementation  no restatement of prior periods has been made 
prior to our implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas since the exercise price of all options granted was not below the fair market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date  prior to our implementation of sfas r we generally recognized no equity based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption stock based compensation for a further discussion 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   and was as follows in thousands year ended december  employee stock options restricted stock units consultant options espp stock based compensation expense before income taxes income tax benefit total stock based compensation expense after income taxes the implementation of sfas r increased basic and fully diluted loss per share from continuing operations by  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sfas r did not have an impact on cash flows from operations during the years ended december  and for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation expense related to the grant of stock options to consultants was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative stock based compensation expense before income taxes income tax benefit total stock based compensation expense after income taxes in connection with the cessation of our operations in denmark and the consolidation of our operations in the united states  we recorded stock compensation expense of  in as part of the restructuring charge 
this expense resulted from the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options held by affected employees of maxygen aps  as required under danish law in connection with the termination of such employees 

table of contents results of operations revenues our revenues have been derived primarily from collaboration agreements  technology and license arrangements and government research grants 
total revenues were million in  million in and million in the increase in revenue from to was primarily due to the recognition of the million of cash proceeds we received under our agreements with bayer for the sale of our hematology assets and the license of our molecularbreeding technology platform 
the decrease in revenue from to resulted primarily from changes in revenues recognized under our prior collaboration agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  as discussed below 
revenues from our collaboration agreements were million in  million in and million in astellas was the only collaborative partner that contributed to our collaborative research and development revenues during collaborative research and development revenues during includes the recognition of million of the million upfront fee we received from astellas under the maxy co development and commercialization agreement and million earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities performed under this agreement during roche was the only collaborative partner that contributed significantly to our collaborative research and development revenues during and the initial funded research term of our collaboration with roche for our maxy alpha product candidates ended in december and the collaboration agreement was terminated in november in december  we entered into a new collaboration with roche for co development and commercialization of our maxy vii product candidates for acute bleeding indications 
this agreement was terminated by roche in april the decrease in collaborative research and development revenue from to and from to was primarily due to the loss of collaborative research and development revenue under the co development and commercialization agreement with roche for our maxy vii product candidates 
for  our collaborative research and development revenue included million earned as net reimbursement of our research and development activities prior to the termination of this agreement 
the termination of this agreement also caused us to accelerate the recognition of million of deferred revenue in the first half of relating to the million non refundable upfront license fee received from roche in technology and license revenue including related party was million for the year ended december   compared to million in these revenues include the million we received from bayer for the sale of our hematology assets and the license of our molecularbreeding technology platform 
also included in technology and license revenue is million in and  in for amounts received under our license agreement with codexis 
these revenues reflect amounts due to us from payments received by codexis under its collaboration arrangement with shell oil products us that began in november and an expanded collaboration agreement between royal dutch shell plc and codexis for the development of new enzymes to convert biomass to fuel 
technology and license revenue in also includes a million non refundable license fee received from sanofi pasteur 
there was no significant technology and license revenue in revenues from government research grants were million in  million in and million in the increase in grant revenue from to is due to increased activity on existing and two new nih grants and two new department of defense grants 
revenues from government research grants in include million from one nih contract for hiv vaccine development 
the increase in grant revenues from to reflects an increase in activity on three new government grant projects begun in the third quarter of in  revenues from government research grants also include million from a contract with the us department of defense for hiv vaccine discovery that expired in october excluding the impact of the one time payment from bayer in  we expect our revenues for to increase compared to primarily due to collaborative research and development revenue we expect to receive in under our collaboration agreement with astellas revenues under this agreement in reflect only 
table of contents three months of revenues from astellas 
our revenues may fluctuate substantially in based on the completion of any strategic transactions or new licensing or collaborative agreements and our receipt of any development related milestones  royalties and other payments under such agreements 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will enter into any strategic transaction or new licensing or collaborative agreements or receive any milestone  royalty or other payments under any existing or future licensing  collaboration or other agreements or whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing and clinical trial expenses  salaries and benefits  facility costs  supplies  research consultants  depreciation and stock compensation expense 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily related to reduced salaries  benefits and other operating expenses resulting from the cessation of operations in denmark in the first quarter of and decreased external expenses associated with the development of our product candidates  including expenses related to clinical trials of our maxy g product candidates and the manufacture of maxy g and maxy vii product for clinical trials 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in stock compensation expenses 
the increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily related to increased external expenses associated with the development of our product candidates  including expenses related to clinical trials of our maxy g product candidates  the manufacture of maxy g and maxy vii product for clinical trials and increased salaries and benefits 
stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of our issuance of restricted stock units in may these increases were partially offset by our cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps  our wholly owned subsidiary in denmark 
there was no additional stock compensation related to the danish employees during stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the issuance of stock options to new us employees that we hired to expand our clinical regulatory organization and to replace capabilities previously performed in denmark 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project 
however  we do estimate  based on full time equivalent personnel effort  the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for projects funded by collaborators and government grants  on the one hand  and projects funded by us  on the other hand 
to approximate research and development expenses by funding category  the number of hours expended in each category has been multiplied by the approximate cost per hour of research and development effort and added to project specific external costs 
in the case where a collaborative partner is sharing the research and development costs  the expenses for that project are allocated proportionately between the collaborative projects funded by third parties and internal projects 
we believe that presenting our research and development expenses in these categories will provide our investors with meaningful information on how our resources are being used 

table of contents the following table presents our approximate research and development expenses by funding category in thousands year ended december  collaborative projects and transition services related to technology and license revenue funded by third parties government grants internal projects total research and development expenses related to collaborative projects funded by third parties may be less than the reported revenues due to the amortization of non refundable upfront payments  as well as a portion of the collaborative research and development revenue that is charged for general and administrative expenses 
our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality and may be barred from commercialization if they are found to infringe or otherwise violate a third party s intellectual property rights 
in addition  competitors may develop superior competing products 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time to completion and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report entitled item a risk factors 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
we expect our research and development expenses to decrease somewhat in the future based on our continued reduction in spending on our maxy g program 
this decrease will be partially offset by research and development costs resulting from the preclinical development of our maxy product candidates  the cost of which will be shared by astellas  and any recommencement or increase in development activities on our maxy g program 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  general management  business development and human resources  insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as external expenditures for legal and accounting services  and stock compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in included in general and administrative expenses were stock based compensation expenses of million in  million in and million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee related costs  including lower expenditures on salaries and benefits related to the cessation of our operations in denmark  offset in part by an increase in external legal and accounting costs in 
table of contents the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to million lower stock compensation expense resulting from consultant options granted in april which were fully amortized by april and an increased number of unvested options being cancelled in compared to the decrease also reflects lower expenditures on external consultants and market analysis 
our general and administrative expenses during should be less than general and administrative expenses for  depending on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in  the use of external consultants and market analysis  and expenditures for legal and accounting services 
goodwill impairment in the second quarter of  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test due to the significant decline of our stock price subsequent to the announcement on june  of certain patent matters related to our maxy g product candidate and concluded that the carrying value of the net assets exceeded our fair value  based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
accordingly  we performed an additional analysis  as required by sfas no 
 which indicated that an impairment loss was probable because the implied fair value of goodwill that was recorded on our balance sheet was zero 
as a result  we recorded an estimated impairment charge of million in the second quarter of relating to the write off of our goodwill 
we completed our determination of the fair value of the affected goodwill during the third quarter of and concluded that no revision of the estimated charge was required 
restructuring charges we recognized charges of in resulting from the cessation of operations at maxygen aps  our danish subsidiary  and the consolidation of our operations in the united states  which we implemented beginning in november we recognized charges of million in  of which million related to the cessation of operations at maxygen aps and million related to the restructuring plan we implemented in october that will result in the termination of approximately of our workforce 
these charges primarily reflect one time termination benefits for the affected employees of maxygen  inc and maxygen aps and other costs associated with the closure of the maxygen aps facility  the disposal of remaining fixed assets and termination of various leases 
the charge in also includes stock compensation expense of approximately  resulting from the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options held by affected employees of maxygen aps  as required under danish law in connection with the termination of such employees 
we completed the activities related to our consolidation of our danish operations during the first half of and do not expect to incur any additional costs relating to this consolidation 
we expect to complete the activities related to our current restructuring plan by april see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these matters 
interest income and other income expense  net interest income and other income expense  net represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  foreign currency gains or losses related to our danish subsidiary  maxygen aps  gain or loss on disposal of equipment and interest expense  if any 
amounts included in interest income and other income expense  net are as follows in thousands year ended december  interest income foreign exchange gains losses gains losses on disposal of equipment and interest expense total interest income and other income expense  net 
table of contents the decrease from to was due to lower interest income resulting from significantly lower interest rates on a slightly higher average investment base partially offset by the million swing in foreign exchange from a million loss in to a  gain in the decrease from to reflects foreign exchange losses in offset by slightly higher interest income resulting from higher interest rates on a lower investment base 
equity in losses of minority investee equity in losses of minority investee reflects our share of the net loss of codexis 
in may  we purchased  of secured subordinated convertible promissory notes and  in august  the notes and accrued interest were converted into codexis preferred stock and we purchased approximately  of additional preferred stock 
subsequent to our investments in may and august  we recorded losses of million under the equity method of accounting and as of december   we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in codexis 
we are not obligated to fund the operations or other capital requirements of codexis 
accordingly  no additional equity losses have been recognized 
as of december   our equity interest in codexis was approximately of its outstanding capital stock 
gain on sale of equity investment on october   amgen inc completed the acquisition of avidia and avidia became a wholly owned subsidiary of amgen inc as a result of the acquisition  we received cash proceeds of approximately million before  of income taxes in the fourth quarter of in exchange for our equity interests in avidia and may receive up to an additional million in cash  contingent upon the development of certain avidia products by amgen inc this contingent amount was reduced from million based on the discontinuation by amgen inc of certain development activities 
we reported an income tax provision of  attributable to federal alternative minimum taxes as a result of the gain on sale of our equity interests in avidia 
accordingly  we recorded a gain net of taxes on disposal of this investment of approximately million in the fourth quarter of see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes no income tax expense was recorded from continuing operations for the years ended december  and income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended december  was  in  we reported an income tax provision of  attributable to federal alternative minimum taxes as a result of the gain on the sale of our equity interests in avidia 
this amount has been netted against the gain on sale of our equity interests in avidia and is reflected in gain on sale of equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations 
for  there was no provision for us federal  us state  or foreign income taxes as we incurred operating losses for all jurisdictions or had sufficient operating losses to carry forward and to reduce any operating income to zero 
for  we will utilize prior year federal net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the federal taxable income to zero for regular tax purposes 
however  for federal purposes  we will be subject to alternative minimum tax which will be fully offset by the refundable research credit claimed under the provisions in the housing and economic recovery act of in there was no provision for us state as we had incurred operating losses and no provision for foreign income taxes as we generated operating income in a foreign jurisdiction that is not subject to tax 
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance decreased by million in due primarily to decreases in deferred taxes related to fixed asset depreciation resulting from the disposal of fixed assets  foreign net operating loss carryforwards related to the cessation of operations in denmark  state net operating losses carryforwards resulting from to an election to exclude certain entities from state filings and federal net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the use of federal net operating loss carryforwards 
this decrease was offset in part by increases in deferred taxes related to deductible stock option compensation 
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance increased by million in due primarily to increases in federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and deferred taxes related to deductible stock option compensation  offset in part by the use of foreign net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that have no expiration date 
as a result of our decision to cease operations in denmark  we have written off our net operating loss carryforwards in denmark and therefore as of december   we had no net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes 
utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization

sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb ratified the final consensus reached by the eitf on issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf  which requires certain income statement presentation of transactions with third parties and of payments between parties to the collaborative arrangement  along with disclosure about the nature and purpose of the arrangement 
eitf is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
during  we adopted the following accounting standards on june   the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires entities to defer income statement recognition of non refundable advance payments for research and development activities  such as upfront non refundable payments to contract research organizations  if the contracted party has not yet performed activities related to the upfront payment 
amounts deferred are to be recognized by the contracting company as expense when the goods are delivered or the research and development activities are performed 
the deferral of income statement recognition of non refundable advance payments for research and development activities under eitf is consistent with how we have accounted for such payments prior to the adoption of eitf we adopted eitf effective january  and there was no effect upon adoption of eitf

sfas 
sfas allows entities the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   except that under fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 companies are allowed to delay the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november  effective january   we have adopted the provisions of sfas and measure our required financial assets and liabilities at fair value

liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our continuing operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities  research and development funding from collaborators and government grants 
we have also financed our operations through the sale or license of various assets 
in july  we received cash proceeds of million from the sale of our hematology assets and the grant of certain license rights to our molecularbreeding technology platform and  in september  we received an upfront fee of million from astellas under our co development and commercialization agreement with astellas for our maxy product candidates 
as a result of the acquisition of avidia by amgen inc  we received cash proceeds of approximately million before  of income taxes in the fourth quarter of in exchange for our equity interests in avidia 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in and net cash used in operating activities was million in and million in the net cash provided by operating activities during was primarily due to the receipt of million of cash from bayer resulting from the sale of our hematology assets and the million upfront payment received from astellas 
these amounts were offset in part by cash used to fund our operating expenses 
for and the uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund losses from continuing operations 
the million increase in cash used in operating activities from to primarily relates to the timing of payments received from roche under our prior collaboration agreements and the payments received under our license agreement with codexis 
for  net cash used in operating activities includes the receipt of million related to various milestone payments under our collaboration agreements with roche 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  million in and million in the cash provided during  and was primarily related to maturities of available for sale securities in excess of purchases 
in addition  in  we received cash proceeds of million before  of income taxes from the sale of our equity interests in avidia 
we expect to continue to make investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our operations 
we may use a portion of our cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  or to obtain the right to use such technologies 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in the cash provided during  and relate to proceeds from the sale of common stock in connection with our espp and the exercise of stock options by employees 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 foreign currency translation  the functional currency for our danish operations was its local currency through november  however  as the result of the consolidation of our research and development activities to our us facilities in redwood city  california and cessation of operations at maxygen aps  we determined that the functional currency of our danish operations is the us dollar after november  consequently  maxygen aps no longer generates translation adjustments which would impact the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
translation adjustments from prior periods will continue to remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
in  there was no effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was an increase of  in and a reduction of  in the following are contractual commitments as of december  associated with lease obligations and purchase obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total as of december   we are eligible to receive up to million in potential milestone and event based payments  including up to million from astellas based on the achievement of certain events related to the development and commercialization of our maxy program  up to million from bayer based on the achievement of certain events related to the potential initiation of a phase ii clinical trial of maxy vii and the satisfaction of certain patent related conditions associated with the maxy vii program  and up to million from sanofi pasteur  the vaccines division of the sanofi aventis group  under our existing license agreement relating to the development of a vaccine for the dengue virus 
however  there can be no assurances that we will receive any milestone or event based payments under any of these agreements 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with funding expected to be received from collaborators  licensors and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed may harm our business and operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange 
to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all investments and substantially all cash and cash equivalents are held in us currency  with approximately of cash and cash equivalents held in danish kroner at december  as of december   of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in one year or less 

table of contents the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
due to the recent adverse developments in the credit markets  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which averages one year or less and may not exceed two years 
however  if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
as of december   we held million of commercial debt securities  with an average time to maturity of days 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but should such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and the maturities of short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we have the ability and intent to hold our debt securities to maturity when they will be redeemed at full par value 
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations previously consisted of research and development activities performed in denmark by our wholly owned subsidiary  maxygen aps 
the functional currency of our danish operations was its local currency through november  however  in november  we implemented a plan to consolidate our research and development activities at our us facilities in redwood city  california  resulting in the cessation of research and development operations at maxygen aps 
as a result  we reevaluated the functional currency for our danish operations and determined that it is the us dollar after november  in  excluding stock compensation expenses  approximately of our operating expenses related to maxygen aps 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the danish kroner and the euro 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar against the danish kroner or the euro will result in an increase of our reported operating expenses 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements are intended to reduce  but may not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us on the amounts hedged 
at december  we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts totaling million 
we had no such foreign currency contracts outstanding at december  during  we recognized  in foreign exchange losses from hedge contracts and  during  we recognized  in foreign exchange gains from hedge contracts 
these gains and losses were included with interest income and other income expense  net
