table of contents general during fiscal  certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations 
more specifically according to some industry estimates  cellular handset unit volumes eroded in excess of between and primarily as a result of adverse global macroeconomic conditions 
despite the overall estimated decrease of approximately in demand  our revenues declined by only or million year over year due to market share gains and a strengthening position in high dollar content g and multimode segments 
we maintained relatively consistent gross profit margins of approximately for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the prior fiscal year despite a year over year decrease in the overall revenue base 
this was principally the result of aggressive year over year material cost reductions  yield improvements  leverage of our fixed costs and cost control measures including capacity management enhanced by the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model 
we generated million in cash provided by operations for fiscal as compared to in fiscal a increase year over year 
this resulted in a cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of million at october   as compared to million at october  in fiscal year  we retired million and million of our convertible notes due in and  respectively 
these retirements reduced the remaining principal balance on our convertible notes to million 
in addition we generated million of cash in fiscal year which has allowed us to improve our net cash position from million at october  to million at october  as revenue declined million sequentially between fiscal and  we implemented broad based cost control measures in order to offset the anticipated decline in operating income 
as a result  our operating income declined only modestly by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal net revenues fiscal years ended october  october  september  dollars in thousands change change net revenues we market and sell our products directly to original equipment manufacturers oems of communication electronic products  third party original design manufacturers odms and contract manufacturers  and indirectly through electronic components distributors 
we periodically enter into revenue generating arrangements that leverage our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our non core patents or other intellectual property 
we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 
overall revenues in fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal this revenue decline was principally due to a reduction in demand in our end markets as a result of adverse global macroeconomic conditions  in addition to our exit from certain product areas such as mobile transceivers in the second fiscal quarter of net revenues from our top three customers decreased to for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to for the corresponding period in the prior year  reflecting continued diversification of our customer base 
overall revenues in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal this revenue growth was principally due to the ramp of new mobile platform products  the addition of new mobile platform customers  
table of contents diversification into new  adjacent markets and the expansion of our market share in increasingly complex front end modules at our existing customers

gross profit fiscal years ended october  october  september  dollars in thousands change change gross profit of net revenues gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation and equity based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing 
we maintained relatively consistent gross profit margins of for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the prior fiscal year despite a year over year decrease in the overall revenue base between the two fiscal years 
this was principally the result of aggressive year over year material cost reductions  yield improvements  leverage of our fixed costs and cost control measures including capacity management enhanced by the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model 
gross profit in aggregate dollars decreased million between fiscal year and fiscal year primarily as the result of the aforementioned million decrease in overall revenues 
in fiscal year  we continued to benefit from higher gross margins associated with intellectual property revenues 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to in fiscal year  from in fiscal year  and was principally the result of a more favorable revenue mix 
additionally  gross profit margin improved as a result of higher equipment efficiencies at all of our factories as our established hybrid manufacturing model with multiple external foundries allows us to maintain high internal capacity utilization by using second sources for high fixed cost services like foundry and assembly 
this approach provides supply chain flexibility  lower capital investment  the ability to meet upside demand and provides cost advantages 
furthermore  yield improvements and year over year material cost reductions along with the increased overall revenue contributed to the gross profit and margin improvement in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales 
in fiscal year  we continued to benefit from higher gross margins associated with intellectual property revenue 
research and development fiscal years ended october  october  september  dollars in thousands change change research and development of net revenues research and development expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  costs for pre production evaluation and testing of new devices  masks and engineering prototypes  equity based compensation expense and design and test tool costs 
the decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is principally attributable to the restructuring plan implemented on january  in which we exited non core product areas 
the increase in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is principally attributable to increased labor and benefit costs and increases in engineering builds

selling  general and administrative expenses increased in aggregate dollars for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to higher share based compensation expense  higher incentive compensation costs and higher sales commissions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of net revenue growth greater than increases in selling  general and administrative costs 
amortization of intangible assets fiscal years ended october  october  september  dollars in thousands change change amortization of net revenues the increase in amortization expense during the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal year is due to additional amortization expense on intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition of axiom microdevices  inc  completed in the third fiscal quarter of the increase in amortization expense during the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal is due to the acquisitions completed in october and the associated amortizable customer relationships  patents  order backlog  foundry services agreement and developed technology that were acquired

we retired a total of million of our convertible notes in fiscal year in september  we retired million and million of our convertible notes due in and  respectively 
we recorded a loss of million during the three months and fiscal year ended october  related to the early retirement of these notes

other income  net fiscal years ended october  october  september  dollars in thousands change change other income  net of net revenues other income  net is comprised primarily of interest income on invested cash balances  other non operating income and expense items and foreign exchange gains losses 
the decreases in other income in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal as well as for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal  is due to an overall decline in interest income on invested cash balances due to lower interest rates in fiscal and benefit for income taxes fiscal years ended october  october  september  dollars in thousands change change benefit for income taxes of net revenues income tax benefit for fiscal was million as compared to a million benefit for fiscal and million for fiscal the fiscal benefit is due to a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to current year utilization and the recognition of future tax benefits on united states state net operating losses  credit carryforwards  and other temporary items and united states income tax benefit of million  offset by reserves for tax uncertainties of million 
the fiscal benefit of million is due to a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on united states federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards  offset by united states income tax expense of million  and a charge in lieu of tax expense of million 
the fiscal charge in lieu of tax expense resulted from a partial recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time of acquisition  the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill 
the fiscal united states income tax benefit of million is due to a 
table of contents million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on united states federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of million of tax reserve no longer required 
the provision benefit for foreign income taxes for fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the foreign tax benefit for fiscal included a reversal of million of reserves for tax uncertainties that are no longer required 
in accordance with gaap  management has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of our historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized 
accordingly  as of october   we have maintained a valuation allowance of million of which million relates to our united states deferred tax assets and million relates to our foreign operations 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating taxable income in the future 
we have considered several factors in evaluating our capacity to generate future earnings 
skyworks has produced a strong earnings trend generating cumulative earnings before income taxes of million in fiscal years through in addition  despite the current economic slowdown  earnings before income taxes of million were reported for fiscal year based on management s evaluation of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets through the generation of future income  million of our valuation allowance was reversed at october  the amount reversed consisted of million recognized as income tax benefit  and million recognized as a reduction to goodwill  which includes million related to the acquired axiom deferred tax assets 
the remaining valuation allowance as of october  is million  principally related to state research tax credits that management has determined is more likely than not that it will not be realized 
when recognized  the tax benefits relating to any future reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as follows approximately million will be recognized as an income tax benefit  million will be recognized as a reduction to goodwill and million will be recognized as an increase to shareholders equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options 
we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance in future periods and depending upon the outcome of that assessment  additional amounts could be reversed or recorded and recognized as a reduction to goodwill or an adjustment to income tax benefit or expense 
such adjustments could cause our effective income tax rate to vary in future periods 
we will need to generate million of future united states federal taxable income to utilize all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards as of october  no provision has been made for united states  state  or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to determine the united states federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
on september   we adopted asc income taxes asc formerly referenced as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this statement also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in the interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of asc will be applied to all income tax provisions commencing from that date 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits at october   million would impact the effective tax rate  if recognized 
there are no positions which we anticipate could change within the next twelve months 
on october   mexico enacted a new flat tax regime which became effective january  gaap prescribes that the effect of the new tax on deferred taxes must be included in tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
the effect of recording deferred taxes in the first fiscal quarter of to the foreign tax provision benefit was million 
we have accrued flat tax for the year ended october  of million

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title  in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
revenue from license fees and intellectual property is 
table of contents recognized when these fees are due and payable  and all other criteria of asc revenue recognition  have been met 
we ship product on consignment to certain customers and only recognize revenue when the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed 
revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete 
certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and or a right of return on unsold products 
a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain general allowances for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
these reserves are determined quarterly and require management to make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  the age of the accounts receivable balances and the impact of the current economic climate on a customer s ability to pay 
in addition  as we become aware of any specific receivables which may be uncollectable  we perform additional analysis and reserves are recorded if deemed necessary 
determination of such additional specific reserves require management to make judgments and estimates pertaining to factors such as a customer s credit worthiness  intent and ability to pay  and overall financial position 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
each quarter  we estimate and establish reserves for excess  obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
these reserves are generally equal to the historical cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory and once recorded are considered permanent adjustments 
calculation of the reserves requires management to use judgment and make assumptions about forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand  competitiveness of our product offerings  general market conditions and product life cycles upon which the reserves are based 
when inventory on hand exceeds foreseeable demand generally in excess of twelve months  reserves are established for the value of such inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory reserves may be required and our results of operations could be materially affected 
some or all of the inventories that have been reserved may be retained and made available for sale  however  they are generally scrapped over time 
share based compensation the company applies asc compensation stock compensation asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options  employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan  restricted stock and other special equity awards based on estimated fair values 
we adopted asc using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the applicable accounting standard as of october   the first day of our fiscal year share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
share based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  only included share based payment awards granted subsequent to september  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adoption of asc  we elected to retain our method of valuation for share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model which was also previously used for our pro forma information disclosure required under previous accounting guidance 
our determination of 
table of contents fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
for more complex awards with market based performance conditions  we employ a monte carlo simulation method which calculates many potential outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the most likely outcome 
asc requires us to evaluate and periodically validate several assumptions in conjunction with calculating share based compensation expense 
these assumptions include the expected life of a stock option or other equity based award  expected volatility  pre vesting forfeiture  risk free rate and expected dividend yield 
all of these assumptions affect to one degree or another  the valuation of our equity based awards or the recognition of the resulting share based compensation expense 
the most significant assumptions in our calculations are described below 
expected life of an option or other equity based award since employee options are non transferable  asc allows the use of an expected life to more accurately estimate the value of an employee stock option rather than using the full contractual term 
the vesting of the majority of our stock options are graded over four years at each anniversary and the contractual term is either years or years 
we analyzed our historical exercise experience and exercise behavior by job group 
we analyzed the following three exercise metrics exercise at full vesting  exercise at midpoint in the contractual life and exercise at the end of the full contractual term 
we chose the mid point alternative as the estimate which most closely approximated actual exercise experience of our employee population 
the valuation and resulting share based compensation expense recorded is sensitive to what alternative is chosen and the choice of another alternative in the future could result in a material difference in the amount of share based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 
expected volatility expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period 
asc does not specify a method for estimating expected volatility  instead it provides a list of factors that should be considered when estimating volatility historical volatility that is generally commensurate with the expected option life  implied volatilities  the length of time a stock has been publicly traded  regular intervals for price observations  corporate and capital structure and the possibility of mean reversion 
we analyzed our volatility history and determined that the selection of a weighting of to historical volatility and to implied volatility as measured by examining the underlying volatility in the open market of publicly traded call options would provide the best estimate of expected future volatility of the stock price 
the selection of another methodology to calculate volatility or even a different weighting between implied volatility and historical volatility could materially impact the valuation of stock options and other equity based awards and the resulting amount of share based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 
pre vesting forfeiture asc specifies that initial accruals of share based compensation expense should be based on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
we examined our options forfeiture history and computed an average annualized forfeiture percentage 
we determined that a weighted average of historical annualized forfeitures is the best estimate of future actual forfeiture experience 
the application of a different methodology for calculating estimated forfeitures could materially impact the amount of share based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 
valuation of long lived assets carrying values for long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets  which exclude goodwill  are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected  historical or projected future operating results  
table of contents significant changes in the manner of use of assets or our business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
in addition  impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever asset asset group values are deemed to be unrecoverable relative to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that particular asset asset group 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset asset group and its eventual disposition 
such estimates require management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding factors such as future revenue streams  operating expenditures  cost allocation and asset utilization levels  all of which collectively impact future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of an asset or asset group  we would recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of asc intangibles goodwill and other asc 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise an insignificant portion of the total book value of our goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the need to test our goodwill for impairment on a regular basis 
pursuant to the guidance provided under asc segment reporting asc  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for the purposes of allocating and testing goodwill under asc the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of our impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment 
to determine fair value  asc allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states that quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for measuring fair value where available 
in our assessment of our fair value  we consider the average market price of our common stock surrounding the selected testing date  the number of shares of our common stock outstanding during such period and other marketplace activity and related control premiums 
if the calculated fair value is determined to be less than the book value of the company  then we perform step two of the impairment analysis 
step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill  to the book value of our goodwill 
if the book value of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of our goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
in step of our annual impairment analysis  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation  which includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies  to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill 
significant management judgment is required in preparing the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
should step two of the impairment test be required  the estimates we would use would be consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
in addition to testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  factors such as unexpected adverse business conditions  deterioration of the economic climate  unanticipated technological changes  adverse changes in the competitive environment  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts  are considered by management and may signal that our intangible assets have become impaired and result in additional interim impairment testing 
in fiscal  we performed impairment tests of our goodwill on january   april  and on july  the first impairment test was triggered by a significant decline in our stock price and deterioration in the macro economic climate during the first fiscal quarter 
the second impairment test was triggered by a restructuring action announced on january  and the third test was conducted on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter  july   in accordance with our regularly scheduled annual testing 
the results of all three of these tests indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired based on step of the test  accordingly step of the test was not performed 
any management judgments and assumptions made in these tests were generally consistent with those made in prior periods 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective 
table of contents tax basis 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly 
likewise  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of goodwill in the period such determination was made 
the determination of recording or releasing tax valuation allowances is made  in part  pursuant to an assessment performed by management regarding the likelihood that we will generate future taxable income against which benefits of our deferred tax assets may or may not be realized 
this assessment requires management to exercise significant judgment and make estimates with respect to our ability to generate revenues  gross profits  operating income and taxable income in future periods 
amongst other factors  management must make assumptions regarding overall business and semiconductor industry conditions  operating efficiencies  our ability to develop products to our customers specifications  technological change  the competitive environment and changes in regulatory requirements which may impact our ability to generate taxable income and  in turn  realize the value of our deferred tax assets 
in addition  the current uncertain economic environment limits our ability to confidently forecast our taxable income 
in fiscal years and  our estimates of future taxable income were prepared in a manner consistent with our assessment of various factors  including market and industry conditions  operating trends  product life cycles and competitive and regulatory environments 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
with the implementation effective september   asc income taxes formerly referenced as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with gaap 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether it is more likely than not that the positions we have taken in tax filings will be sustained upon tax audit  and the extent to which  additional taxes would be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
recently issued accounting pronouncements asc in december  the fasb issued amendments to asc business combinations asc  which established principles and requirements for the acquirer of a business to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets including in process research and development and defensive assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the amendments to asc are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  prior to the adoption of asc  in process research and development costs were immediately expensed and acquisition costs were capitalized 
under asc all acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
the standard also provides guidance for recognizing and 
table of contents measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
in april the fasb updated asc to amend the provisions for the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting  and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations 
this update also eliminates the distinction between contractual and non contractual contingencies 
the company expects asc will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions the company consummates after the october  effective date 
asc in december  the fasb issued amendments to asc consolidation asc 
asc amends previously issued authoritative literature to amend accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it also amends certain of consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of asc this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially adopted 
the company does not expect the adoption of asc to impact its results of operations or financial position because the company does not have any minority interests 
asc in september  the fasb issued asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  for financial assets carried at fair value  and years beginning after november  for non financial assets not carried at fair value 
the company has determined that the adoption of asc will not have a material impact on the company s results from operations or financial position 
asc in february  the fasb issued asc financial instruments asc  including an amendment of asc investments debt and equity securities asc  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
asc is effective for the company beginning on october  the adoption of asc will not have a material impact on the company s results from operations or financial position 
asc in may  the fasb issued asc debt  debt with conversions and other options asc 
asc alters the accounting treatment for convertible debt instruments that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlements 
asc is expected to impact the company s accounting for its convertible notes and previously held junior notes 
this authoritative accounting literature requires registrants with specified convertible note features to recognize non cash interest expense based on the market rate for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
furthermore  pursuant to its retrospective accounting treatment  the accounting literature requires prior period interest expense recognition 
asc is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating asc and the impact that it will have on its consolidated financial statements 
the company will adopt asc topic on october  asc in may  the fasb established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued 
this guidance was included in the codification under asc subsequent events asc  and became effective for the company beginning with the third fiscal 
table of contents quarter of we performed an evaluation of subsequent events through november   and we issued our financial statements on november  asc in june  the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
this guidance was included in the codification under asc generally accepted accounting principles asc 
all prior accounting standard documents were superseded by the codification and any accounting literature not included in the codification is no longer authoritative 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
the codification became effective for the company beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of therefore  beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of  all references made by the company to gaap in its notes to the consolidated financial statements use the new codification numbering system 
the codification does not change or alter existing gaap and  therefore  did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asu and asu in september  the fasb reached a consensus on accounting standards update asu revenue recognition asc multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu and asu software asc certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu modifies the requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vsoe or ii third party evidence  or tpe  before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these asus will have on our consolidated financial statements 
other matters inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the three year period ended october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to foreign currency  market rate and interest risks as described below investment and interest rate risk our exposure to interest and market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio  which as of october  consisted of the following in thousands cash and cash equivalents time deposits  overnight repurchase agreements and money market funds restricted cash time deposits and certificates of deposit available for sale securities auction rate securities 
table of contents the main objective of our investment activities is the liquidity and preservation of capital 
credit risk associated with our investments is not significant as our investment policy prescribes high credit quality standards and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading  speculative or investment purposes 
in general  our cash and cash equivalent investments have short term maturity periods which dampen the impact of significant market or interest rate risk 
we are  however  subject to overall financial market risks  such as changes in market liquidity  credit quality and interest rates 
available for sale securities carry a longer maturity period contractual maturities exceed ten years 
in fiscal  we experienced what we believe will be a temporary unrealized loss on our investment in auction rate securities primarily caused by a disruption in the liquidity of the dutch auction process which resets interest rates each period 
we classified auction rate securities in prior periods as current assets under short term investments 
given the failed auctions  the auction rate securities are effectively illiquid until there is a successful auction 
accordingly  the remaining auction rate securities balance has been reclassified to non current other assets 
however  it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the auction rate securities prior to maturity 
our short term debt consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank  na of million 
interest related to our borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank  na is at libor plus and was approximately at october  consequently  we do not have significant cash flow exposure on this short term debt or interest rate risk 
our long term debt at october  consists of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes convertible notes  of which million are classified in short term debt as current maturities 
these convertible notes contain cash settlement provisions  which permit the application of the treasury stock method in determining potential share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the company s common stock exceed 
it has been the company s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments  and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future  including settlement of the convertible notes issued in march these shares have been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended october  exchange rate risk substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results 
a small percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those operating costs 
for the fiscal years ended october   october   and september   the company had unrealized foreign exchange gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies
