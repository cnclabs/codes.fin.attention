item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with risk factors appearing in item a of this annual report on form k  selected financial data appearing in item of this annual report on form k and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including note to such financial statements 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to  among other things  our critical accounting estimates discussed below and important other factors set forth in this annual report on form k 
please see special note regarding forward looking statements above 
overview we are a provider of high performance optical components  modules and subsystems to the telecommunications telecom market  and believe we are one of the largest providers into metro and long haul network applications 
we leverage proprietary core technologies and vertically integrated product development to provide our telecommunications customers with cost effective and innovative optical solutions through the transmission products and regeneration and optical routing products of our telecom segment 
since our april  merger with avanex corporation avanex  we have been realigning the resulting combined telecom business segment into two product groups i transmission  and ii regeneration and optical routing 
we also have an advanced photonics solutions division that is chartered with diversification and growth into new markets  leveraging our brand  chip design and manufacturing expertise 
we are a global company with chip fabrication facilities in the united kingdom  switzerland and italy  as well as in arizona on a temporary basis during the transition of manufacturing related activities acquired from newport corporation newport on july  to our european facilities over the upcoming quarters  manufacturing sites in the united states  thailand and china  and research and development teams in the united states  united kingdom  switzerland  italy and china 
we are the result of the april  merger of bookham  inc bookham and avanex  with bookham becoming the parent company and changing its name to oclaro  inc oclaro upon the close of the merger 
subsequent to the merger  avanex corporation changed its name to oclaro north america  inc all references in this annual report on form k to bookham refer to oclaro  inc  and all references to avanex refer to oclaro north america  inc we issued approximately  shares of oclaro common stock for all of the shares of avanex outstanding on april  under the terms of the merger  avanex stockholders received shares of oclaro common stock for every share of avanex common stock they owned 
the combination is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization for federal income tax purposes 
all financial information herein prior to april  relates to the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the former bookham  and all financial information subsequent to april  herein relates to the consolidated financial position and results of operations of oclaro  which includes the consolidated financial information of avanex since april  we have accounted for this merger under the purchase method of accounting  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and the results of operations of avanex from the closing date of the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements at june  and for the fiscal year then ended 
for accounting purposes  the fair value of the consideration paid in the merger was million  which includes the issuance of million in common stock  based on a price of per share of oclaro common stock  which was the weighted average of the closing market prices of oclaro s common stock for a period beginning two days before and ending two days after january   the day the merger was announced  million for the assumption of vested stock options and warrants to purchase oclaro common stock  and million in acquisition related transaction costs 

table of contents the following table presents the allocation of the purchase price  including professional fees and other related transaction costs  to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values as of april  purchase price allocation thousands cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash accounts receivable inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets property and equipment other non current assets accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities other long term liabilities total purchase price on july   we closed a transaction with newport  under which newport acquired the assets of the new focus business of oclaro photonics  inc  which is in our advanced photonics solutions division  in exchange for the assets of the high power laser diodes business of newport  which will become part of our advanced photonics solutions division 
we also received million in cash proceeds in the transaction  which is expected to fund the substantial portion of related transition and integration costs 
we expect the acquisition to leverage our existing state of the art global manufacturing infrastructure and lower certain of our product costs  including the costs of certain of our transmission products  as a result of operating efficiencies achieved through economies of scale and greater factory utilization

application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from those based on our estimates and judgments or could be materially different if we used different assumptions  estimates or conditions 
in addition  our financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of such estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that the policies described below involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition and sales returns revenue represents the amounts  excluding sales taxes  derived from the provision of goods and services to third party customers during a given period 
our revenue recognition policy follows securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
specifically  we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  title has transferred  collectability is reasonably assured  fees are fixed or determinable and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
for certain sales  we are required to determine  in particular  whether the delivery has occurred  whether items will be returned and whether we will be paid under normal commercial terms 
for certain products sold to customers  we specify delivery terms in the agreement under which the sale was made and assess each 
table of contents shipment against those terms  and only recognize revenue when we are certain that the delivery terms have been met 
for shipments to new customers and evaluation units  including initial shipments of new products  where the customer has the right of return through the end of an evaluation period  we recognize revenue on these shipments at the end of the evaluation period  if not returned  and when collection is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded  which is netted against revenue 
these estimates for sales returns are based on historical sales return rates  other known factors and our return policy 
before accepting a new customer  we review publicly available information and credit rating databases to provide ourselves with reasonable assurance that the new customer will pay all outstanding amounts in accordance with our standard terms 
for existing customers  we monitor historic payment patterns to assess whether we can expect payment in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement under which the sale was made 
we recognize revenues from financially distressed customers when collectability becomes reasonably assured  assuming all other above criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in fiscal year we issued billings of i million for products that were shipped to nortel  but for which payment was not received prior to nortel s bankruptcy filing on january   and ii million for products that were shipped to a contract manufacturer for which payment might not have been received due to the nortel bankruptcy filing 
as a result  an aggregate of million in revenue was deferred  and therefore was not recognized as revenues or accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at the time of such billings  as we determined that such amounts were not reasonably assured of collectability in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
as of june   we had contractual receivables from nortel totaling million which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that collectability becomes reasonably assured for these deferred billings in future periods  our future results of operations will benefit from the recognition of these amounts 
inventory valuation in general  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost to acquire or manufacture our products or market value  less write offs of inventory we believe could prove to be unsaleable 
manufacturing costs include the cost of the components purchased to produce our products and related labor and overhead 
we review our inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if it is saleable 
products may be unsaleable because they are technically obsolete due to substitute products  specification changes or excess inventory relative to customer forecasts 
we currently reserve for inventory using methods that take these factors into account 
in addition  if we find that the cost of inventory is greater than the current market price  we will write the inventory down to the selling price  less the cost to complete and sell the product 
accounting for acquisitions and goodwill through june   we have accounted for acquisitions using the purchase accounting method in accordance with sfas no 
under this method  the total estimated purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their fair values  with any excess allocated to goodwill defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our judgments as to fair value of the assets will  therefore  affect the amount of goodwill that we record 
these judgments include estimating the useful lives over which the fair values will be amortized to expense 
for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  we estimate useful lives by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and specific factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  patents  supply agreements  capitalized licenses and customer contracts 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from three to six years and  in the case of one specific customer contract  fifteen years 
acquisitions consummated after june   including the acquisition of the high power laser diodes business from newport on july   will be accounted for pursuant to sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r there are significant differences as compared to sfas no 
in determining the purchase price of an acquired entity  including the requirement to expense transaction costs and to reflect the fair value of contingent purchase price adjustments at the date of acquisition 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested annually for impairment  in our case during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if an event or circumstance suggests impairment has occurred 
in addition  we review identifiable intangibles  excluding goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes to the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly below carrying value before the end of its estimated useful life 
sfas no 
requires that the first phase of testing goodwill for impairment be based on a reporting unit s fair value  which is generally determined through market prices 
in certain cases  due to the absence of market prices for a particular element of our business  and as permitted by sfas no 
 we have elected to base our testing on discounted future expected cash flows 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the forecasted cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we perform and present to our board of directors 
in this process  each reporting unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three to seven years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels and general economic trends 
the discount rates used for determining discounted future cash flows are generally based on our weighted average cost of capital and are then adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results and country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three to seven year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used in our models are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industry in which we operate 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable  various economic factors could cause the results of our goodwill testing to vary significantly 
during the year ended june   we observed indicators of potential impairment of our goodwill  including the impact of the current general economic downturn on our future prospects and the continued decline of our market capitalization  which caused us to conduct a goodwill impairment analysis 
specifically  indicators emerged for sfas no 
purposes within the oclaro photonics  inc reporting unit the new focus reporting unit  which includes the technology acquired in the march acquisition of oclaro photonics  inc and is in our non telecom segment  and one other reporting unit in our non telecom segment that includes the technology acquired in the march acquisition of avalon photonics ag the avalon reporting unit 
these indicators led us to conclude that a sfas no 
impairment test was required to be performed for goodwill related to these reporting units 
we determined  in our first step goodwill impairment analysis  that our goodwill related to the new focus and avalon reporting units was in fact impaired 
based upon preliminary calculations  we recorded million for the impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended december  during the three months ended march   we completed our full evaluation of the second step impairment analysis  which indicated that the goodwill of million was fully impaired 
the impairment will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended june   in conjunction with our full evaluation of the second step goodwill impairment analysis  we also evaluated the fair value of the intangible assets of these two reporting units  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on this testing  we have determined that the intangibles of our new focus reporting unit were impaired by million and that the intangibles of our avalon reporting unit were impaired by million 
we recorded million for the impairment loss related to the avalon reporting unit in continuing operations and million for the impairment 
table of contents loss related to the new focus reporting unit in discontinued operations in our fiscal year consolidated statement of operations 
accounting for share based payments sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  requires companies to recognize in their statement of operations all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  based on their fair values on the grant dates 
the application of sfas no 
r involves significant amounts of judgment in the determination of inputs into the black scholes merton valuation model which we use to determine the fair value of share based awards 
these inputs are based upon highly subjective assumptions as to the volatility of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates and the expected life of the options 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited during any given period 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
during the years ended june   june  and june   we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively  in our results from continuing operations 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information 
results of operations on june  we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with newport  under which newport would acquire the new focus business of our advanced photonics solutions division in exchange for the newport high power laser diodes business 
the transaction closed on july  we have classified the financial results of the new focus business as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the following presentations relate to continuing operations only  unless otherwise indicated 
fiscal years ended june  and june  the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended june  and june   and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended increase june  june  change decrease thousands thousands thousands net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring and severance charges legal settlements    n m impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets   n m gain on sale of property and equipment total operating expenses

net revenues for the year ended june  increased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended june  the increase was primarily related to the inclusion of million of avanex related revenues subsequent to our merger on april   as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  largely offset by decreased revenues of million related to our pre merger telecom and million related to our advanced photonics solution segments 
we believe the decrease in our telecom sales was primarily attributable to the uncertainty in the global economic downturn  in particular within north american and europe  and the resulting impact on certain of our customers and the overall markets for our products 
for the year ended june   huawei accounted for million  or percent  of our net revenues and nortel accounted for million  or percent  of our net revenues 
for the year ended june   nortel accounted for million  or percent  of our net revenues and huawei accounted for million  or percent  of our net revenues 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with manufacturing our products  and includes the purchase of raw materials  labor costs and related overhead  including stock based compensation charges  and the costs charged by our contract manufacturers on the products they manufacture 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory  including in regards to inventories procured by contract manufacturers on our behalf  the cost of product returns and warranty costs are also included in cost of revenues 
costs and expenses related to our manufacturing resources which are incurred in connection with the development of new products are included in research and development expense 
our cost of revenues for the year ended june  increased million  or percent  from the year ended june  the increase was primarily related to the inclusion of million in avanex related cost of revenues subsequent to our merger on april   largely offset by decreases from realizing the full year benefits of previous cost reduction efforts described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and temporary measures taken to reduce costs in our manufacturing facilities during the economic downtown in the second half of fiscal year cost of revenues for the year ended june  relative to the year ended june   were also favorably impacted by a million reduction in our uk manufacturing costs associated with the weakening of the uk pound sterling relative to the us dollar 
cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended june  included million of stock based compensation charges compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  gross profit 
gross profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues 
gross margin rate is gross profit reflected as a percentage of revenues 

table of contents our gross margin rate increased to percent for the year ended june   compared to percent for the year ended june  the increase in gross margin rate was due to improved costs and yields in certain product areas in our telecom segment  including our tunable products  the benefit of previous manufacturing overhead cost reduction efforts being in place for an entire year  and from temporary measures to reduce the costs in our manufacturing sites during the economic downturn 
gross margin for the year ended june  relative to the ended june   was also favorably impacted by a million reduction in our uk manufacturing costs associated with the weakening of the uk pound sterling relative to the uk dollar 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research and design activities  including stock based compensation charges related to those employees  costs of design tools and computer hardware  and costs related to prototyping 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to million in cost savings associated with the uk pound sterling weakening relative to the us dollar  of which approximately million was personnel related 
there was a further million reduction in stock based compensation 
these reductions were offset by increased spend on materials used in new product development  increased research and development expenditures of million in our shenzhen  china site and the addition of million in research and development expenses from avanex for the period from april  to june  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation charges related to employees engaged in sales  general and administrative functions  legal and professional fees  facilities expenses  insurance expenses and certain information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily the result of million in cost reductions associated with the uk pound sterling weakening relative to the uk dollar  million in lower stock compensation charges  and million in other cost reductions  partially offset by million in expenses from avanex for the period from april  to june  amortization of intangible assets 
during fiscal year  certain of the purchased intangible assets from our prior business acquisitions became fully amortized 
additionally  purchased intangible assets related to our avalon reporting unit were determined to be impaired in the third quarter of fiscal year  and written down to fair value as described above 
collectively  these events reduced our expense for amortization of purchased intangible assets for the year ended june  by million as compared to the year ended june  at june   there are million in remaining intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization and impairment charges  subject to the amortization provisions of sfas no 
amortization expense is expected to be million in each of the next five years 
the purchase accounting for our merger with avanex on april  did not generate additional intangible assets 
restructuring and severance charges 
in connection with our merger with avanex  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we initiated an overhead cost reduction plan which includes workforce rationalizations as well as shut downs and or relocations of our fremont  california and villebon  france facilities 
during fiscal year we accrued merger related restructuring charges of approximately million for employee separation charges and million in expenses for lease commitments related to vacating our fremont and villebon locations 
we expect to incur  and pay within the next twelve months  a total of approximately million in restructuring and related charges associates with our merger with avanex 
in fiscal year  we also expect to incur and pay approximately million in restructuring and related charges associated with our acquisition of newport s laser diode business and fabrication facility in tucson and the related move of the fabrication activities to europe 
we anticipate paying for these expenses with the million in proceeds received from newport in connection with this transaction 
in connection with earlier plans of restructuring  during fiscal year we accrued approximately million in additional expenses for revised estimates of the cash flows for lease cancellations and commitments  
table of contents and approximately million for additional employee separation charges 
these additional restructuring costs were substantially associated with the advanced photonics solutions segment 
in connection with earlier plans of restructuring  during fiscal year we accrued approximately million in additional expenses for revised estimates of the cash flows for lease cancellations and commitments  and approximately million for additional employee separation charges 
the additional lease costs were associated with the advanced photonics solutions segment and the additional employee separation charges were primarily associated with our telecom segment 
legal settlements 
on april   we settled outstanding litigation with a competitor 
in connection with the settlement of these lawsuits  for the year ended june   we recorded legal settlement expense of million 
of these amounts  million represents settlement payments paid or payable  and million represents legal fees incurred in connection with the litigation and settlement 
for additional information on this settlement  see legal proceedings  in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
in the year ended june   we also recorded million in additional gain  revising our original estimate of a gain on settlement of a legal action in connection with our sale of land in swindon  uk to a third party in in the year ended june   we recorded a gain from legal settlements  net of costs  of million associated with the settlement of a legal action connected with our sale of land in swindon  uk to a third party in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the fiscal year ended june  we determined  in accordance with sfas no 
 that the goodwill related to our new focus and avalon reporting units was fully impaired  and we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million for goodwill impairment 
in conjunction with our review of goodwill  we recorded million for the impairment loss related to certain intangible assets related to our avalon reporting unit in our fiscal year statement of operations 
the impairment charges will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
gain on sale of property and equipment 
gain on sale of property and equipment in the year ended june  was not significant  compared to million in the year ended june  gain on sale of property and equipment in fiscal year was primarily associated with the sale of fixed assets which became surplus as a result of our various restructurings and cost reduction programs  including the shutting down of sites and transfers of certain manufacturing operations 
other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended june  increased by million compared to the year ended june   primarily related to an increase of million related to the re measurement of short term balances among our international subsidiaries due to fluctuations in the us dollar during the periods relative to our other local functional currencies  partially offset by a million expense related to the fair value impairment of our short term investment in a debt security of lehman brothers holdings inc  and a million decrease in interest income for the year ended june  due to lower average invested balances and lower average interest rates 
interest expense was million and million in the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively  and consisted of bank charges and costs primarily associated with our million senior secured bank credit facility 
gain loss on foreign exchange includes the net impact from the re measurement of intercompany balances and monetary accounts not denominated in functional currencies  other than the us dollar  and realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency contracts not designated as hedges 
the net results for the fiscal years ended june  and june  are largely a function of exchange rate changes between the u 
s dollar and the uk pound sterling and to a lesser degree the exchange rate changes between the us dollar and the swiss franc  the chinese yuan  the euro and in fiscal year  the thai baht 
income tax provision 
for the fiscal year ended june  our income tax provision was million  primarily due to a one time expense of million related to our restructuring activities in france as a result of the avanex merger and million in provision related to our manufacturing operations in italy 
our income tax provision was negligible for fiscal year based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our 
table of contents historical operating performance and the recorded cumulative net losses in prior periods  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million and million at june  and june   respectively 
fiscal years ended june  and june  the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended june  and june   and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts thousands and as a percentage of net sales  except where indicated year ended increase june  june  change decrease thousands thousands thousands net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring and severance charges legal settlements   n m impairment of other long lived assets   n m gain on sale of property and equipment total operating expenses operating loss other income expense interest income interest expense gain loss on foreign exchange    n m total other income expense    n m loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax n m net loss not meaningful net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended june  increased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended june  our telecom segment revenues for the year ended june  increased by million  to million  from million in the year ended june   primarily related to a million increase in sales of our tunable products 
our advanced photonics solutions segment revenues for the year ended june  increased by million  to million  from million in the year ended june   primarily related to increased sales of high power lasers and industrial filter products 
for the fiscal year ended june   nortel accounted for percent and huawei accounted for percent of our net revenues 
for the fiscal year ended june   nortel accounted for percent  cisco systems accounted for percent and huawei accounted for percent of our netrevenues 

table of contents cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues for the year ended june  increased by percent compared to the year ended june   primarily associated with the increased sales mentioned above  partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from the restructuring and cost reduction plans described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
gross profit 
our gross margin rate increased to percent for the year ended june  compared to percent for the year ended june  the increase in gross margin was primarily associated with increased sales volumes in both of our operating segments for the year ended june  as compared to june   spread against a manufacturing overhead cost base which had decreased for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  as a result of the restructuring and cost reduction plans described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june   primarily as a result of decreases in personnel and related costs associated with restructuring and cost reduction plans 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at million in the year ended june   compared to million in the year ended june  decreases in professional fees including audit and accounting services and information systems costs savings were offset by an increase in stock based compensation related to stock awards with performance based vesting 
in the years ended june  and june   our selling  general and administrative expenses included million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense recorded in accordance with sfas no 
r 
amortization of intangible assets 
decreases in our amortization of intangible assets to million in the year ended june  from million in the year ended june  were due to the balances of certain of the purchased intangible assets associated with previous acquisitions becoming fully amortized during the years ended june  and june  restructuring and severance charges 
decreases in our restructuring and severance charges to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  were due to progress in our restructuring and cost reduction plans  as described below

we began implementing this overhead cost reduction plan in the quarter ended march   and the related actions also included consolidation of certain head office functions in our san jose  california facility 
a substantial portion of the costs associated with this plan were personnel severance and retention related expenses 
as of december  the plan was substantially complete 
we incurred  and have paid  related expenses of million associated with this plan 
in may  september and december  we announced restructuring plans  including the transfer of our assembly and test operations from paignton  uk to shenzhen  china  along with reductions in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
these cost reduction efforts were expanded in november to include the transfer of our chip on carrier assembly from paignton to shenzhen

other income expense 
the million increase in other income expense for the year ended june  when compared to the year ended june  was primarily related to i an increase of million in gain on foreign exchange from the re measurement of intercompany balances and monetary accounts not denominated in functional currencies  other than the us dollar  and ii realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency contracts not designated as hedges

future cash requirements as of june   we held million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash and million in short term investments 
on april  we closed our merger with avanex  which contributed million in cash balances and short term investments to the combined entity 
we expect that our cash generated from operations  together with our current cash balances  short term investments  and amounts expected to be available under our amended credit agreement  which are based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the amended credit agreement at the time the advance is requested  will provide us with sufficient financial resources in order to operate as a going concern through at least the four fiscal quarters subsequent to the fiscal year ended june  to strengthen our financial position  in the event of unforeseen circumstances  or in the event needed to fund growth in future financial periods  we may raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity  debt or convertible debt or the sale of certain product lines and or 
table of contents portions of our business 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
from time to time  we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines  technologies and businesses  such as our merger with avanex and recently announced exchange of assets agreement with newport  as described elsewhere herein  and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates 
any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities  debt  and or cash consideration 
we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition  through either the issuance of equity securities or borrowings 
if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
risk management foreign currency risk as our business is multinational in scope  we are increasingly subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
in the future we expect that a majority of our revenues will be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the us pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the swiss franc  the thai baht and the euro  in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen  china  zurich  switzerland  bangkok  thailand and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and the chinese yuan were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling  and we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of june   we held seven foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to december during the year ended june   we recorded a net loss of million in our statement of operations in connection with foreign exchange contracts that expired during that year 
as of june  we recorded an unrealized loss of million to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at june   by nature of the obligation and amount due over identified periods of time  are set out in the table below operating sublease purchase long term leases income obligations obligations thousands thereafter the purchase obligations consist of our total outstanding purchase order commitments as at june  any capital purchases to which we are committed are included in these outstanding purchase orders under standard terms and conditions 
operating leases are future annual commitments under non cancelable operating leases  including rents payable for land and buildings 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we indemnify our directors and certain employees as permitted by law  and have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers 
we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements as we historically have not incurred any costs associated with such indemnification obligations and do not expect to in the future 
costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain  however such insurance may not cover any  or may cover only a portion of  the amounts we may be required to pay 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
we also have indemnification clauses in various contracts that we enter into in the normal course of business  such as those issued by our bankers in favor of several of our suppliers or indemnification in favor of customers in respect of liabilities they may incur as a result of purchasing our products should such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have not historically paid out any amounts related to these indemnifications and do not expect to in the future  therefore no accrual has been made for these indemnifications 
other than as set forth above  we are not currently party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we finance our operations through a mixture of issuances of equity securities  operating leases  working capital and the expected ability to draw on the amended credit agreement 
our only exposure to interest rate fluctuations is on our cash deposits  our short term investments and for amounts borrowed under the amended credit agreement 
at june  and june   there were no amounts outstanding under this credit agreement 
as of june   we had million in outstanding standby letters of credits with a vendor secured under this credit agreement 
we monitor our interest rate risk on cash balances primarily through cash flow forecasting 
cash that is surplus to immediate requirements is invested in short term deposits with banks accessible with one day s notice and invested in overnight money market accounts 
we believe our current interest rate risk is immaterial 
foreign currency as our business has grown and become multinational in scope  we have become increasingly subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
despite our change in domicile from the united kingdom to the united states in  and our movement of certain functions  including assembly and test operations  from the united kingdom to china  in the future we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the uk pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses  could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the swiss franc  the thai baht and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen  china  zurich  switzerland  bangkok  thailand and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
as of june   our uk subsidiary had million  net  in us dollar denominated operating intercompany payables and million in us dollar denominated accounts receivable related to sales to external customers 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the us dollar relative to the us pound sterling would lead to a profit of million us dollar strengthening  or loss of million us dollar weakening on the translation of these receivables  which would be recorded as gain loss on foreign exchange in our statement of operations 

table of contents hedging program we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to the swiss franc or the chinese yuan  but we may in the future if conditions warrant 
we also do not currently hedge our exposure related to our us dollar denominated intercompany payables and receivables 
we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of june   we held seven foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to december and we have recorded an unrealized loss of million to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the dollar between june  and the maturity dates of the put and call instruments underlying these contracts would lead to a profit of million us dollar weakening or loss of million us dollar strengthening on our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  should they be held to maturity
