we have experienced no material difficulties in complying with legislative or regulatory standards and believe that these standards have not materially impacted our financial position or results of operations 
although our future compliance with additional environmental requirements could necessitate capital outlays  we do not believe that these expenditures would ultimately result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

risk factors you should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this form k  including the following risk factors  before investing in any of our securities 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports that we file with the sec in the future 
our business is cyclical and can be negatively impacted by prolonged economic downturns or tightening in the credit markets that reduce the level of construction activity and demand for our products 

table of contents demand for our concrete reinforcing products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in the economy and in the credit markets 
our products are sold primarily to manufacturers of concrete products for the construction industry and used for a broad range of nonresidential and residential construction applications 
demand in these markets is driven by the level of construction activity  which tends to be correlated with conditions in the general economy as well as other factors beyond our control 
the tightening in the credit markets during fiscal could continue to unfavorably impact demand for our products by reducing the availability of financing to our customers and the construction industry as a whole 
although the implementation of unprecedented measures by the federal government have improved liquidity in the financial markets  the availability of financing continues to be constrained and the ultimate impact of these measures remains uncertain 
future prolonged periods of economic weakness or reduced availability of financing could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
demand for our products is highly variable and difficult to forecast due to our minimal backlog and the unanticipated changes that can occur in customer order patterns or inventory levels 
demand for our products is highly variable 
the short lead times for customer orders and minimal backlog that characterize our business make it difficult to forecast the future level of demand for our products 
in some cases  unanticipated downturns in demand have been exacerbated by inventory reduction measures pursued by our customers 
the combination of these factors may cause significant fluctuations in our sales  profitability and cash flows 
our customers may be adversely affected by the continued negative macroeconomic conditions and tightening in the credit markets 
current negative macroeconomic conditions and the tightening in the credit markets could limit the ability of our customers to fund their financing requirements  thereby reducing their purchasing volume with us 
further  the reduction in the availability of credit may increase the risk of customers defaulting on their payment obligations to us 
the continuation or occurrence of these events could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the additional federal infrastructure related funding provided for under the american recovery and reinvestment act arra is expected to have a favorable impact on demand for our products  the timing and magnitude of the impact are uncertain 
arra provides for significant increases in federal infrastructure related funding  which should have a favorable impact on demand for our products 
however  the timing and magnitude of the impact are uncertain  and we do not expect that it would be sufficient to offset the reduced demand for our products resulting from the continued weakening in nonresidential construction attributable to the economic downturn and the tightening in the credit markets 
our financial results can be negatively impacted by the volatility in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled carbon steel wire rod 
the primary raw material used to manufacture our products is hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in the price of wire rod as such instruments are currently unavailable in the financial markets 
beginning in fiscal  a tightening of supply in the rod market together with fluctuations in the raw material costs of rod producers resulted in increased price volatility which continued through fiscal  when wire rod prices rose to a record high 
during  wire rod prices plummeted in response to weakening demand due to the recessionary conditions in the economy and inventory destocking measures that were pursued throughout the supply chain 
in response to the increased pricing volatility  wire rod producers have resorted to increasing the frequency of price adjustments  typically on a monthly basis as well as unilaterally changing the terms of prior commitments 
although changes in our wire rod costs and selling prices tend to be correlated  depending upon market conditions  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should raw material costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory  as experienced during fiscal our financial results can also be significantly impacted if raw material supplies are inadequate to satisfy our purchasing requirements 
trade actions by domestic wire rod producers against offshore suppliers can also have a substantial impact on the availability and cost of imported wire rod 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duty margins by the department of 
table of contents commerce against exporting countries can have the effect of reducing or eliminating their activity in the domestic market  which is of increasing significance in view of the reductions in domestic wire rod production capacity that have occurred in recent years 
if we were unable to obtain adequate and timely delivery of our raw material requirements  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or operate our manufacturing facilities in an efficient manner which could result in lost sales and higher operating costs 
foreign competition could adversely impact our financial results 
our pc strand business has experienced increasing competitive pressures from offshore producers exporting into the domestic market  particularly from china 
beginning in the second half of fiscal  we elected not to pursue certain pc strand business that had been negatively impacted by low priced chinese import competition 
if we are unable to purchase raw materials and achieve manufacturing costs that are competitive with those of foreign producers  or if the margin and return requirements of foreign producers are substantially lower  our market share and profit margins could be negatively impacted 
in  we  together with a coalition of us producers of pc strand  obtained a favorable determination from the international trade commission the itc in response to the petitions we had filed alleging that imports of pc strand from brazil  india  korea  mexico and thailand were being dumped or sold in the us at a price that was lower than the price in their home markets or their cost and had injured the domestic pc strand industry 
the itc imposed anti dumping duties ranging from up to which had the effect of limiting the participation of these companies in the domestic market 
the itc is expected to complete its sunset review of these duties on november  should the itc vote against the continuation of the duties  imports of pc strand from these countries are likely to rise  which would have a negative impact on our pc strand business 
in may  a coalition of us pc strand producers  including insteel  filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions alleging that imports of pc strand from china were injuring the domestic pc strand industry 
the petitions allege that imports of pc strand from china were being dumped or sold in the us at a price that was lower than its fair value and that subsidies were being provided to chinese pc strand producers by the chinese government 
the petitioners are alleging dumping margins ranging from to  with an average margin of 
on october   the us department of commerce doc issued a preliminary determination in the affirmative regarding the countervailing duty case  imposing preliminary margins ranging from to on imports of pc strand from china 
as a result  importers are required to post cash deposits or bonds on all future imports of chinese pc strand in the amount of the preliminary margins calculated by the doc 
the current deadline for the preliminary decision on the antidumping case is december  if the doc rules in the affirmative on the antidumping case  importers would be required to begin posting cash deposits or bonds on all future imports of chinese pc strand in the amount of the preliminary antidumping margins calculated by the doc in addition to the preliminary countervailing duty margins 
the entire investigative process is anticipated to take approximately one year  with the final determinations of injury  dumping and subsidies expected to occur in mid our manufacturing facilities are subject to unexpected equipment failures  operational interruptions and casualty losses 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture products  including unexpected equipment failures and catastrophic losses due to other unanticipated events such as fires  explosions  accidents  adverse weather conditions and transportation interruptions 
any such equipment failures or events can subject us to material plant shutdowns  periods of reduced production or unexpected downtime 
furthermore  the resolution of certain operational interruptions may require significant capital expenditures 
although our insurance coverage could offset the losses or expenditures relating to some of these events  our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that such claims were not covered or only partially covered by our insurance 
our financial results could be adversely impacted by the continued escalation in certain of our operating costs 
our employee benefit costs  particularly our medical and workers compensation costs  have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise 
in addition  higher prices for natural gas  electricity  fuel and consumables increase our manufacturing and distribution costs 
most of our sales are made under terms whereby we incur the fuel costs and surcharges associated with the delivery of products to our customers 
although we have implemented numerous measures to offset the impact of the ongoing escalation in these costs  there can be no assurance that such actions will be effective 
if we are unable to pass these additional costs through by raising selling prices  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for our capital investment and maintenance expenditures if we were to 
table of contents experience a substantial downturn in our financial performance 
our operations are capital intensive and require substantial recurring expenditures for the routine maintenance of our equipment and facilities 
although we expect to finance our business requirements through internally generated funds or from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility  we cannot provide any assurances these resources will be sufficient to support our business 
a material adverse change in our operations or financial condition could limit our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility which could further adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition 
any significant future acquisitions could require additional financing from external sources and may not be available on favorable terms which could adversely impact our operations  growth plans  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
our business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment that could result in substantially increased capital investments and operating costs 
these laws and regulations  which are constantly evolving  are becoming increasingly stringent and the ultimate impact of compliance is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
our production and earnings could be reduced by strikes or work stoppages by our unionized employees 
as of october   we employed people  of which were represented by labor unions employees at our wilmington  delaware facility and employees at our jacksonville  florida facility 
we have collective bargaining agreements in place with each union 
the agreement for the wilmington facility expires on november  the agreement for the jacksonville facility expires on april of each year and is automatically renewed unless either party provides notification of its intent to modify or terminate the agreement 
should we experience a disruption of production at any facility  we have contingency plans in place that would enable us to continue serving our customers  although there can be no assurances that a strike  slowdown or work stoppage would not adversely impact our operating costs and overall financial results 
our stock price can be volatile  often in connection with matters beyond our control 
equity markets in the us have often been volatile 
during fiscal  our common stock traded as high as and as low as 
the following factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  several of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly and annual operating results  changes in our business outlook  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry  changes in the expectations for nonresidential and residential construction  and announcements by us  our competitors or industry participants that may be perceived to impact us or our operations

item legal proceedings 
on november   dywidag systems international  inc dsi filed a third party lawsuit in the ohio court of claims alleging that certain epoxy coated strand sold by us to dsi in  and supplied by dsi to the ohio department of transportation odot for a bridge project  was defective 
the third party action seeks recovery of any damages which may be assessed against dsi in the action filed against it by odot  which allegedly could be in excess of million  plus 
table of contents million in damages allegedly incurred by dsi 
we had previously filed a lawsuit against dsi in the north carolina superior court in surry county on july  seeking recovery of million plus interest owed for other products sold by us to dsi and a judgment declaring that we had no liability to dsi arising out of the odot bridge project 
our north carolina lawsuit was subsequently removed by dsi to the us district court for the middle district of north carolina and on july   the federal district court denied our motion to remand the matter to the surry county court 
the parties continue to contest the appropriate jurisdiction in which this litigation should proceed 
with regard to dsi s third party lawsuit  we filed a motion for summary judgment in the ohio court of claims lawsuit on june  and discovery has commenced on a limited basis 
we intend to vigorously defend the claims asserted against us by dsi in addition to pursuing full recovery of the amounts that are owed to us by dsi 
we have concluded that a loss is not yet probable with respect to this matter  and therefore no liability has been recorded 
in the event the ultimate resolution of the case is unfavorable  we have estimated that the potential loss could range up to million

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the matters discussed in this section include forward looking statements that are subject to numerous risks 
you should carefully read the cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors in this form k 
overview following our exit from the industrial wire business see note to the consolidated financial statements  our operations are entirely focused on the manufacture and marketing of concrete reinforcing products for the concrete construction industry 
the results of operations for the industrial wire business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our business strategy is focused on achieving leadership positions in our markets  operating as the lowest cost producer  and pursuing growth opportunities within our core businesses that further our penetration of current markets served or expand our geographic reach 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the application of these accounting principles in addition to certain estimates and judgments based on current available information  actuarial estimates  historical results and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the depiction of our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgments  assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition when products are shipped and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
sales taxes collected from customers are recorded on a net basis and as such  are excluded from revenue 
concentration of credit risk 
financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are held and by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
we invest excess cash primarily in money market funds  which are highly liquid securities that bear minimal risk 
our cash is concentrated primarily at one financial institution  which at times exceeds federally insured limits 
most of our accounts receivable are due from customers that are located in the us and we generally require no collateral depending upon the creditworthiness of the account 
we utilize credit insurance on certain accounts receivable due from customers located outside of the us we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment of the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments on outstanding balances owed to us 
significant management judgments and estimates are used in establishing the allowances 
these judgments and estimates consider such factors as customers financial position  cash flows and payment history as well as current and expected business conditions 
it is reasonably likely that actual collections will differ from our estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in the allowances 
adjustments to the allowances may also be required if there are significant changes in the financial condition of our customers 
inventory valuation 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory 
this evaluation includes assessing the adequacy of allowances to cover losses in the normal course of operations  providing for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensuring that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
our evaluation considers such factors as the cost of inventory  future demand  our historical experience and market conditions 
in assessing the realization of inventory values  we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding future market conditions 
because of the subjective nature of these judgments and estimates  it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates 
adjustments to these reserves may be required if actual market conditions for our products are substantially different than the assumptions underlying 
table of contents our estimates 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to medical and workers compensation claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed by the insurance industry and historical experience 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  changes in benefit levels and claim settlement patterns 
because of uncertainties related to these factors as well as the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  future adjustments to these reserves may be required 
litigation 
from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and the potential losses that we may ultimately incur 
we record expenses for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of legal counsel  the outcome of similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits and other factors 
due to the numerous factors that enter into these judgments and assumptions  it is reasonably likely that actual outcomes will differ from our estimates 
we monitor our potential exposure to these contingencies on a regular basis and may adjust our estimates as additional information becomes available or as there are significant developments 
assumptions for employee benefit plans 
we account for our defined employee benefit plans  the insteel wire products company retirement income plan for hourly employees  wilmington  delaware the delaware plan and the supplemental employee retirement plans each  a serp in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
under the provisions of asc topic  we recognize net periodic pension costs and value pension assets or liabilities based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rates we utilize for determining net periodic pension costs and the related benefit obligations for our plans are based  in part  on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings assigned by recognized rating agencies 
our discount rate assumptions are adjusted as of each valuation date to reflect current interest rates on such long term bonds 
the discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations as of the valuation date as well as the interest component of the net periodic pension cost for the following year 
the discount rate for the delaware plan was  and for  and  respectively 
the discount rate for the serps was  and for  and  respectively 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the delaware plan represents the estimated average rate of return expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plan s assets to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
the amount of net periodic pension cost that is recorded each year is based on the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and  when appropriate  rebalance the investments in the plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation 
for  and  the assumed long term rate of return utilized for plan assets of the delaware plan was 
we currently expect to use the same assumed rate for the long term return on plan assets in in determining the appropriateness of this assumption  we considered the historical rate of return of the plan assets  the current and projected asset mix  our investment objectives and information provided by our third party investment advisors 
the projected benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the delaware plan are based in part on expected increases in future compensation levels 
our assumption for the expected increase in future compensation levels is based upon our average historical experience and management s intentions regarding future compensation increases  which generally approximates average long term inflation rates 
assumed discount rates and rates of return on plan assets are reevaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in the recognition of materially different pension costs over different periods and materially different asset and liability amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals 
table of contents living longer or shorter lives than assumed in the mortality tables that are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
under gaap  actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income over future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unamortized actuarial gains 
the amounts recognized as net periodic pension cost and as pension assets or liabilities are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
we believe that all of the actuarial assumptions used for determining the net periodic pension costs and pension assets or liabilities related to the delaware plan are reasonable and appropriate 
the funding requirements for the delaware plan are based upon applicable regulations  and will generally differ from the amount of pension cost recognized under asc topic for financial reporting purposes 
no contributions were required to be made to the delaware plan during  and we currently expect to record net periodic pension costs totaling  during  although we do not expect any cash contributions to the delaware plan will be required during the year 
contributions to the serps are expected to total  during  matching the required benefit payments 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate for the delaware plan would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of october  by approximately  and the expected net periodic pension cost for by approximately  a decrease in the assumed discount rate for our serps would have increased our projected and accumulated benefit obligations as of october  by approximately  and  respectively  and increased the net periodic pension cost for by approximately  a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for the delaware plan would have increased the expected net periodic pension cost for by approximately  recent accounting pronouncements

this amendment requires objective disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets including investment policies and strategies  categories of plan assets  fair value measurements of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk 
this amendment is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years ending after december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements

the reduction in shipments was primarily due to the general economic downturn  the tightening in credit markets and the surge in low priced imports of pc strand during  which resulted in customer inventory destocking through most of the year 
the decline in average selling prices was driven by the collapse in steel prices that occurred through most of the current year together with weakening demand following the unprecedented escalation in raw material costs and selling prices that occurred during the prior year 
gross profit loss the gross loss for was million  or of net sales compared to gross profit of million  or of 
table of contents net sales in the gross loss for the year reflects a pre tax charge of million for inventory write downs to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market resulting from the decline in selling prices for certain products during the year relative to higher raw material costs under the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
the gross loss for the current year also reflects the unfavorable impact of the reductions in shipments and selling prices  the consumption of higher cost inventory that was purchased prior to the recent collapse in steel prices and the escalation in unit conversion costs resulting from reduced operating schedules at our manufacturing facilities 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense decreased to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales in primarily due to reductions in employee incentive plan expense million  supplemental employee retirement plan expense  travel expense  and bad debt expense 
the reduction in employee incentive plan expense was related to the decline in our financial performance during the current year 
the reduction in travel expense was primarily due to the implementation of various cost reduction measures 
these reductions were partially offset by the net gain on a life insurance settlement in the prior year  and increases in stock based compensation expense  legal expense  employee benefit costs  and consulting expense 
the increase in legal expense was primarily associated with the trade cases that have been filed regarding imports of pc strand from china 
the increase in employee benefit expense was largely due to higher employee medical costs 
interest expense interest expense for increased  or to  from  in primarily due to higher average outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility in the current year 
interest income interest income for decreased  or  to  from  in primarily due to lower rates of return on cash investments in the current year

earnings loss from discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations for was million per share compared with earnings of  in  which had no effect on earnings per share 
the current year loss is primarily due to a pre tax impairment charge of million million or per share after tax to write down the carrying value of the real estate held for sale associated with the industrial wire business  which we exited in the earnings in resulted from escrow payments we received that were forfeited by a prospective buyer of the industrial wire facility 
net earnings loss the net loss for was million per share compared to net earnings of million per diluted share in primarily due to the decreases in net sales and gross profit 
compared with net sales net sales increased to million in from million in average selling prices for the year increased while shipments decreased from the prior year levels 
the increase in average selling prices was driven by price increases that were implemented during the year to recover the unprecedented escalation in our raw material costs 
the 
table of contents reduction in shipments was primarily due to the continuation of weak demand from customers that have been negatively impacted by the downturn in residential construction activity 
gross profit gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales in primarily due to higher spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs  which more than offset lower shipments and higher unit conversion costs 
the widening in spreads during the current year was primarily driven by the price increases that were implemented together with the consumption of lower cost inventory under the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense increased to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales in primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs  bad debt expense  compensation expense  and supplemental employee retirement plan expense  which were partially offset by the net gain on life insurance settlements  and decreases in consulting expense  travel expense  and legal fees 
interest expense interest expense for was relatively flat at  compared to  in  primarily consisting of non cash amortization expense associated with capitalized financing costs 
interest income interest income for increased  or  to  from  in primarily due to higher average cash balances 
income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to in from in due to an increase in permanent differences resulting from higher tax credits attributable to domestic production activities and nontaxable proceeds associated with life insurance settlements

the current year loss reflects a pre tax charge of million for inventory write downs 
net working capital provided million of cash in the current year largely due to the million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from the reductions in shipments and selling prices  and the million decrease in inventories excluding the impact of the inventory write downs resulting from our inventory reduction initiatives 
these decreases were partially offset by the million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses that was primarily due to the payment of million of accrued income taxes payable and lower raw material purchases 
in addition to these changes in working capital  the million of other changes in assets and liabilities in the current year includes million of estimated income taxes receivable that were recorded in prepaid expenses and other resulting from the current year loss 
net working capital used million and million in and  respectively 
the cash used by working capital in was due to the million increase in inventories and the million increase in accounts receivable resulting from an escalation in raw material costs and selling prices  which were partially offset by an million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses largely related to higher raw material purchases 
the cash used by working capital in was primarily due to the million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the sharp reduction in raw material purchases together with changes in the mix of vendor payments 
additionally  depreciation and amortization expense increased million from to as a result of the elevated level of capital expenditures and related asset additions 
as the impact and duration of the current economic slowdown become clearer  we may make additional adjustments in our operating activities  which could materially impact our cash requirements 
while an economic slowdown adversely affects sales to our customers  it generally reduces our working capital requirements 
investing activities used million of cash during compared to million during and million in capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively  with the higher levels in the prior years primarily related to the expansion and upgrading of our manufacturing facilities 
capital expenditures are expected to total less than million for fiscal current year investing activities also include  of proceeds from the surrender of life insurance policies compared to  in the prior year and a  increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies resulting from the increase in the value of the underlying investments compared to  in and  in investing activities in also include million of proceeds from claims on life insurance policies 
investing activities are largely discretionary and future outlays could be reduced significantly or eliminated should economic conditions warrant 
financing activities used million of cash during compared to million and million during and  respectively 
during the current year  million of cash dividends were paid compared to million and million during and  respectively 
additionally  million of shares were repurchased during 
table of contents credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility in place  which matures in june and supplements our operating cash flow in funding our working capital  capital expenditure and general corporate requirements 
no borrowings were outstanding on the credit facility as of october  and september  and outstanding letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
as of october   million of borrowing capacity was available on the credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended october   ordinary course borrowings on our revolving credit facility were as high as million 
we believe that  in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands  cash and cash equivalents  and net cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our expected requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends and share repurchases  if any 
we can also access the amounts available under our revolving credit facility  which we expect to either extend or replace prior to the june maturity date 
in the event that we elected not to extend or replace the existing revolving credit facility or if we were unable to do so  we believe that cash and cash equivalents  and net cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our expected funding requirements 
however  further deterioration in general economic conditions could result in additional reductions in demand from our customers  which would likely reduce our operating cash flows 
under such circumstances  we may need to curtail capital and operating expenditures  delay or restrict share repurchases  cease dividend payments and or realign our working capital requirements 
should we determine  at any time  that we require additional short term liquidity  we would evaluate the alternative sources of financing that are potentially available to provide such funding 
there can be no assurance that any such financing  if pursued  would be obtained  or if obtained  would be adequate or on terms acceptable to us 
however  we believe that our strong balance sheet and capital structure as of october  positions us to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
our liquidity position is further supported by the borrowing capacity available to us under our existing credit facility 
impact of inflation we are subject to inflationary risks arising from fluctuations in the market prices for our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  and  to a much lesser extent  freight  energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes 
we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices to pass through increases in these costs or offset them through various cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives 
however  our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics  and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs 
during  selling prices for our products declined dramatically in response to softening demand and the inventory destocking measures pursued by our customers  which negatively impacted our financial results as we consumed higher cost inventory that was purchased prior to the collapse in steel prices 
in contrast  during  we implemented price increases in response to the unprecedented escalation in wire rod costs  which materially increased our net sales and earnings as we consumed lower cost inventory 
during  inflation did not have a material impact on our sales or earnings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  as defined by item a of regulation s k of the sec  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources or significant components of revenues or expenses 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations and commitments at october  are as follows 
table of contents payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations raw material purchase commitments supplemental employee retirement plan obligations pension benefit obligations operating leases trade letters of credit other unconditional purchase obligations commitment fee on unused portion of credit facility total non cancelable fixed price purchase commitments for raw materials 
contractual commitments for capital expenditures 
outlook our visibility for business conditions in is clouded by the continued uncertainty regarding future global economic conditions  the availability of financing in the credit markets and the timing and magnitude of the impact of the federal infrastructure related funding provided for under the american recovery and reinvestment act arra as well as the next federal highway funding authorization 
although we expect nonresidential construction  our primary demand driver  to decrease from the levels of recent years  particularly for commercial projects which have been the most severely impacted by the economic downturn  the additional infrastructure funding provided for under arra should serve to at least partially mitigate this decline 
we anticipate that residential construction will remain weak  but gradually improve over the course of the year  favorably impacting shipments to customers that have greater exposure to the housing sector 
following an extended downward trend that began in september  prices for our primary raw material  hot rolled steel wire rod  appear to have leveled out in recent months  although their future direction remains highly uncertain 
the recent closures of two us rod mills that represented over of total domestic capacity has the potential to drive prices higher  although the impact is likely to be minimized to the extent that demand for wire rod remains at depressed levels 
in response to the challenges facing us  we will continue to focus on the operational fundamentals of our business closely managing and controlling our expenses  aligning our production schedules with demand in a proactive manner as there are changes in market conditions to minimize our cash operating costs  and pursuing further improvements in the productivity and effectiveness of all of our manufacturing  selling and administrative activities 
we also expect gradually increasing contributions from the substantial investments we have made in our facilities in recent years in the form of reduced operating costs and additional capacity to support future growth when market conditions improve see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
in addition to these organic growth and cost reduction initiatives  we are continually evaluating potential acquisitions in our existing businesses that further our penetration in current markets served or expand our geographic reach 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as necessary 
commodity prices we are subject to significant fluctuations in the cost and availability of our primary raw material  hot rolled carbon steel wire rod  which we purchase from both domestic and foreign suppliers 
we negotiate quantities and pricing for both domestic and foreign steel wire rod purchases for varying periods most recently monthly for domestic suppliers  depending upon market conditions  to manage our exposure to price fluctuations and to ensure adequate availability of material consistent with our 
table of contents requirements 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in prices as such instruments are not currently available for steel wire rod 
our ability to acquire steel wire rod from foreign sources on favorable terms is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign taxes  duties  tariffs and other trade actions 
although changes in wire rod costs and our selling prices may be correlated over extended periods of time  depending upon market conditions and competitive dynamics  there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increased rod costs through higher selling prices  which would reduce our gross profit and cash flow from operations 
additionally  should wire rod costs decline  our financial results may be negatively impacted if the selling prices for our products decrease to an even greater degree and to the extent that we are consuming higher cost material from inventory 
based on our shipments and average rod cost reflected in cost of sales  a increase in the price of steel wire rod would have resulted in a million decrease in our annual pre tax earnings assuming there was not a corresponding change in our selling prices 
interest rates although we were debt free as of october   future borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange exposure we have not typically hedged foreign currency exposures related to transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and any such transactions historically have not been material 
we will occasionally hedge firm commitments for equipment purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the decision to hedge any such transactions is made by us on a case by case basis 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of october  during fiscal  a increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies to which we are typically exposed would not have had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
