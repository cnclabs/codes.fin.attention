the turn signal feature in exterior mirrors currently represents approximately one percent of our revenues  and the litigation does not involve core gentex technology 
the trial in wisconsin related to this case occurred during july and the court issued its written ruling in december the court found that muth s us patent no 
 is invalid and unenforceable  and that gentex s razor turn signal mirror does not infringe that patent 
the court also denied all but one of muth s other motions with prejudice  including its motion for an injunction  and its claims for tortuous interference with its business relationships

prepaid expenses and other current assets as of december   increased approximately  compared to december   primarily due to an increase in refundable income taxes

as automotive production schedules continued to decline  the company permanently laid off approximately hourly and salaried workers in december  which reduced overhead and operating expenses  bringing them to a level that is more in line with currently expected sales production levels in the automotive and fire protection industries 
the salaried workforce reductions will reduce overhead and operating expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis 
approximately half of the expense reductions will impact the company s overhead expenses  and the other half will impact the company s operating expenses  primarily in the engineering  research development areas 
the company currently estimates that top line revenue will decline approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in based on our current forecast for light vehicle production levels and product mix 
these estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the regions to which the company ships product  as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix 
uncertainties  including vehicle production levels  extended automotive plant shutdowns  sales rates in north america  europe and asia  and the impact of potential automotive customer including their tier suppliers bankruptcies  work stoppages  strikes  etc  which could disrupt our shipments to these customers making forecasting difficult 
due to significant uncertainties with global vehicle production volumes  it is an extremely difficult environment to forecast  and as a result  the company is not providing revenue estimates beyond the first quarter of at this time

critical accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended 
accordingly  revenue is recognized based on the terms of the customer purchase order that indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment 
sales are shown net of returns  which have not historically been significant 
the company does not generate sales from sale arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accounts receivable 
the company estimates its allowances related to receivables on historical credit and collections experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
actual collections can differ  requiring adjustments to the allowances 
inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
investments 
the company s investment committee regularly reviews its fixed income and equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other than temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in income 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  the company evaluates  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
management also considers the type of security  related industry  sector performance  as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports to evaluate its portfolio 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions continue to deteriorate  the company may incur future impairments 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
the company utilizes the black scholes model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating a the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  b the volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  c the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures and d expected dividends 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized on the consolidated condensed statements of operations
