description of business we are a billion community based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our two operating segments community banking and insurance 
our community bank  summit community bank  has a total of banking offices located in west virginia and virginia 
in addition  we also operate an insurance agency  summit insurance services  llc with an office in moorefield  west virginia which offers both commercial and personal lines of insurance and two offices in leesburg  virginia  primarily specializing in group health  life and disability benefit plans 
although our business operates as two separate segments  the insurance segment is not a reportable segment as it is immaterial  and thus our financial information is presented on an aggregated basis 
summit financial group  inc employs approximately full time equivalent employees 
overview our primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits 
business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates  business spending  and consumer confidence  as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace 
key items in net income for totaled million compared to million income from continuing operations in the decline is primarily a result of higher loan loss provisions and other than temporary impairment on securities 
we strengthened our allowance for loan losses to reflect the weaker economy and its current and future impact on asset quality 
the million loan loss provision recorded this year raised the allowance for loan losses to percent of total loans at year end  after net loan charge offs of million during the course of the year 
we felt the impact of the housing crisis as reflected by the impairment of our investments in freddie mac and fannie mae preferred stock resulting in million in charges recorded relative to these securities in asset growth of percent was primarily driven by loan growth of million  or percent year over year  which was derived principally from commercial and commercial real estate loans 

table of contents we are experiencing the challenges related to the current economic environment  as evidenced by the dramatic increase in nonperforming assets at december   climbing to million from million one year ago 
our loan quality was impacted by the contracting economy and commercial real estate market  which caused declines in real estate values and deterioration in financial condition of various borrowers 
these conditions led to our downgrading the loan quality ratings on various real estate loans through our normal loan review process 
in addition  several impaired loans became under collateralized due to the reduction in the estimated net realizable fair value of the underlying collateral 
stability of the net interest margin  this continues to be a highlight of our performance despite the rapid decline of interest rates beginning in third quarter however  the impact of foregone interest income from nonaccruing loans has negatively impacted the margin during the last two quarters of we remained well capitalized by regulatory capital guidelines at december   however access to new capital resources is presently constrained 
we mutually terminated the greater atlantic merger agreement 
outlook summit remains well capitalized  adequately reserved and profitable 
the company has adequate liquidity and is positioned to weather the current economic conditions and return to increased profitability when conditions improve 
in the short term  however  management anticipates the company s net income and earnings per common share will continue to be negatively impacted  probably significantly  by continuing high levels of loan losses and nonperforming assets  a weak economy  low asset and revenue growth  low interest rates  and higher fdic premiums 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of goodwill and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section of this financial review 
goodwill goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded 
table of contents balances are necessary 
a fair value is determined based on at least one of three various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair value equals or exceeds the book value  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value 
during the third quarter of  we completed the required annual impairment test and determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
we can not assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
see notes and of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets  which include goodwill 
fair value measurements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  on january  this standard provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with the three level hierarchy eg  level  level and level established under sfas fair value determination in accordance with sfas requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

a summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion 
net interest income the major component of our net earnings is net interest income  which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds 
net interest income is affected by changes in volume  resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet s composition  fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds 
we seek to maximize net interest income through management of our balance sheet components 
this is accomplished by determining the optimal product mix with respect to yields on assets and costs of funds in light of projected economic conditions  while maintaining portfolio risk at an acceptable level 
consolidated net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis  consolidated average balance sheet amounts  and corresponding average yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years  and are presented in table i 
table ii presents  for the periods indicated  the changes in consolidated interest income and 
table of contents expense attributable to a changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate and b changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior period volume 
changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
tables i and ii are presented on a consolidated basis 
the results would not vary significantly if presented on a continuing operations basis 
consolidated net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis  totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing a increase in and in these increases in net interest income are the result of substantial loan growth in the commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios in all three years 
total average earning assets increased to  at december  from  at december  total average interest bearing liabilities increased to  at december   compared to  at december  as identified in table ii  consolidated tax equivalent net interest income grew  and  during and  respectively 
our consolidated net interest margin was for compared to and for and  respectively 
our consolidated net interest margin decreased basis points in  driven primarily by the reversal of loan interest income related to nonaccrual loans placed on nonaccrual status during late and the continued reduction in interest income as a result of these loans remaining on nonaccrual status  and by a slight change in our balance sheet mix as the basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets was mirrored by a basis point decrease in our cost of interest bearing funds 
our consolidated net interest margin decreased basis points in  driven by a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing funds while the increase on the yields on interest earning assets was only basis points 
see tables i and ii for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our consolidated net interest income 
we anticipate a stable net interest margin in the near term as we do not expect interest rates to rise in the near future  we do not expect significant growth in our interest earning assets  nor do we expect our nonperforming asset balances to decline significantly in the near future 
we continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact 
see the market risk management section for further discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us

we also recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million the entire amount on our investment in greater atlantic financial corp 
stock  which we continue to own 
at december  we had million in unrealized losses related to residential mortgage backed securities issued by nongovernment sponsored entities 
we monitor the performance of the mortgages underlying these bonds 
although there has been some deterioration in collateral performance  we only hold the most senior tranches of each issue which provides protection against defaults 
we attribute the unrealized loss on these mortgage backed securities held largely to the current absence of liquidity in the credit markets and not to deterioration in credit quality 
we expect to receive all contractual principal and interest payments due on our debt securities and have the ability and intent to hold these investments until their fair value recovers or until maturity 
the mortgages in these asset pools have been made to borrowers with strong credit history and significant equity invested in their homes 
they are well diversified geographically 
nonetheless  significant further weakening of economic fundamentals coupled with significant increases in unemployment and substantial deterioration in the value of high end residential properties could extend distress to this borrower population 
this could increase default rates and put additional pressure on property values 
should these conditions occur  the value of these securities could decline and trigger the recognition of an other than temporary impairment charge 
at december   we did not own securities of any one issuer that were not issued by the us treasury or a us government agency that exceeded ten percent of shareholders equity

asset quality during  certain of our customers began experiencing difficulty making timely payments on their loans 
due to current declining economic conditions  borrowers have in many cases been unable to refinance their loans due to a range of factors including declining property values 
as a result  we have experienced higher delinquencies and nonperforming assets  particularly in our residential real estate loan portfolios and in commercial construction loans to residential real estate developers 
it is not known when the housing market will stabilize 
while management anticipates loan delinquencies will remain higher than historical levels for the foreseeable future  we anticipate that nonperforming assets will remain elevated in the near term

all nonperforming loans are individually reviewed and adequate reserves are in place 
the majority of nonperforming loans are secured by real property with values supported by appraisals 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impaired loans which are included in the above balances 
as a result of our internal loan review process  the ratio of internally classified loans to total loans increased from at december  to at december  our internal loan review process includes a watch list of loans that have 
table of contents been specifically identified through the use of various sources  including past due loan reports  previous internal and external loan evaluations  classified loans identified as part of regulatory agency loan reviews and reviews of new loans representative of current lending practices 
once this watch list is reviewed to ensure it is complete  we review the specific loans for collectibility  performance and collateral protection 
in addition  a grade is assigned to the individual loans utilizing internal grading criteria  which is somewhat similar to the criteria utilized by our subsidiary bank s primary regulatory agency 
the increase in internally classified loans at december  occurred throughout our portfolios of real estate related loans  as shown in the table below  as several of these loans have been downgraded by management as they fell outside of our internal lending policy guidelines  became past due or were placed on nonaccrual status 
internally classified loans balance at december  dollars in thousands commerical commercial real estate land development construction residential real estate consumer total included in the net balance of loans are nonaccrual loans amounting to  and  at december  and  respectively 
if these loans had been on accrual status throughout  the amount of interest income that we would have recognized would have been  the actual amount of interest income recognized in on these loans was  in addition to nonperforming loans discussed above  we have also identified approximately million of potential problem loans at december  related to relationships 
these potential problem loans are loans that were performing at december   but known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated 
we conduct quarterly evaluations of our loan portfolio to determine its adequacy 
in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we conduct a two part evaluation 
first  we specifically identify loans that have weaknesses that have been identified  using the fair value of collateral method 
second  we stratify the loan portfolio into homogeneous loan pools  including commercial real estate  other commercial  residential real estate  autos  and others 
historical loss rates  as adjusted  are applied against the then outstanding balance of loans in each classification to estimate probable losses inherent in each segment of the portfolio 
historical loss rates are adjusted using potential risk factors that could result in actual losses deviating from prior loss experience 
such risk factors considered are levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and term of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practice  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
in addition  we conduct comprehensive  ongoing reviews of our loan portfolio  which encompasses the identification of all potential problem credits to be included on an internally generated watch list 
the identification of loans for inclusion on the watch list of loans that have been specifically identified is facilitated through the use of various sources  including past due loan reports  previous internal and external loan evaluations  classified loans identified as part of regulatory agency loan reviews and reviews of new loans representative of current lending practices 
once this list is reviewed to ensure it is complete  we review the specific loans for collectibility  performance and collateral protection 
in addition  a grade is assigned to the individual loans utilizing internal grading criteria  which is somewhat similar to the criteria 
table of contents utilized by our subsidiary bank s primary regulatory agency 
based on the results of these reviews  specific reserves for potential losses are identified and the allowance for loan losses is adjusted appropriately through a provision for loan losses 
the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is established on a loan by loan and pool by pool basis 
the unallocated portion is for inherent losses that probably exist as of the evaluation date  but which have not been specifically identified by the processes used to establish the allocated portion due to inherent imprecision in the objective processes we utilize to identify probable and estimable losses 
this unallocated portion is subjective and requires judgment based on various qualitative factors in the loan portfolio and the market in which we operate 
the entire allowance for loan losses was allocated at december  and at december   the unallocated portion of the allowance approximated  or of the total allowance 
this unallocated portion of the allowance is considered necessary based on consideration of the known risk elements in certain pools of loans in the loan portfolio and our assessment of the economic environment in which we operate 
more specifically  while loan quality remains good  the subsidiary bank has typically experienced greater losses within certain homogeneous loan pools when our market area has experienced economic downturns or other significant negative factors or trends  such as increases in bankruptcies  unemployment rates or past due loans 
at december  and  our allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans and  or of total loans  respectively  and is considered adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio

liquidity is provided primarily by funds invested in cash and due from banks net of float and reserves  federal funds sold  non pledged securities  and available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank  which totaled approximately  or of total consolidated assets at december  our liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits and other borrowed funds while maintaining an adequate level of short and medium term investments to meet normal daily loan and deposit activity 
core deposits increased million in  while loans increased approximately million

future cash dividends will depend on the earnings  and financial condition of our subsidiary bank and our capital adequacy as well as general economic conditions 
the primary source of funds for the dividends paid to our shareholders is dividends received from our subsidiary bank 
dividends paid by our subsidiary bank are subject to restrictions by banking regulations 
the most restrictive provision requires approval by the bank s regulatory agency if dividends declared in any year exceed the bank s current year s net income  as defined  plus its retained net profits of the two preceding years 
during  the net retained profits available for distribution to summit as dividends without regulatory approval are approximately  plus net income for the interim periods through the date of declaration

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of embedded options 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to minimize interest rate risk and our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of our asset liability management committee alco 
the alco is comprised of members of senior management and members of the board of directors 
the alco actively formulates the economic assumptions that we use in our financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor our sources  uses and prices of funds 
some amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate to the banking business 
our net income is affected by changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   our interest rate risk position was liability sensitive 
that is  liabilities are likely to reprice faster than assets  resulting in a decrease in net interest income in a rising rate environment  while a falling interest rate environment would produce an increase in net interest income 
net interest income is also subject to changes in the shape of the yield curve 
in general  a flat yield curve results in a decline in our earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates  while a steepening would result in increased earnings as margins widen 
several techniques are available to monitor and control the level of interest rate risk 
we primarily use earnings simulations modeling to monitor interest rate risk 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
each increase or decrease in rates is assumed to gradually take place over a month period  and then remain stable 
assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits are derived from historical analysis 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit repricings are modeled on historical patterns 
the following table presents the estimated sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates  as measured by our earnings simulation model as of december  the sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income given the stated changes in interest rates gradual change over months  stable thereafter compared to net interest income with rates unchanged in the same period 
the estimated changes set forth below are dependent on the assumptions discussed above and are well within our alco policy limit  which is a reduction in net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
change in interest rates estimated change in net interest income over basis points months months down up up up  flattening yield curve assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve assumes flattening curve whereby short term rates increase by basis points while long term rates increase soas to bear the same average relationship to short term rates that existed during thru  the last extended period of a flat yield curve environment
