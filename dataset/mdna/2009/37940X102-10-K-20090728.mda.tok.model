see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and item a risk factors for a discussion of risks involved with our international operations 
merchant services overview our merchant acquiring services are similar around the world in that we accept a variety of card based payments at the point of sale 
we conduct our merchant acquiring business using two different business models direct and indirect 
in the direct model  merchants are our end customers 
we provide our merchant customers with the ability to accept card based and check payments 
the term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services 
we sell our services through multiple sales channels around the world and target customers in many vertical industries 
card based payment forms consist of credit  debit  gift  stored value  and electronic benefits transfer cards 
credit and debit 
table of contents 
index to financial statements card transaction processing includes the processing of visa  mastercard  discover and jcb credit cards  cards issued by other card networks like american express and debit cards 
credit and debit card processing involves a consumer or cardholder acquiring goods or services from a merchant and using a credit or debit card as the form of payment 
we are the processing intermediary between the merchant  the credit and debit networks and the financial institutions that issue cards 
our services include a comprehensive offering including terminal sales and deployment  front end authorization processing  settlement and funding processing  full customer support and help desk functions  chargeback resolution  industry compliance  pci security  consolidated billing and statements  and on line reporting 
our value proposition is to provide high quality  responsive  secure and full end to end service to all of our customers 
currently  we market direct merchant services in the united states  canada  the asia pacific region  the united kingdom  and the russian federation 
indirect merchant services provides similar basic products and services as our direct merchant services model  primarily to financial institutions and a limited number of isos on an unbundled basis  that in turn resell our products and services to merchants 
these services are marketed in the united states and parts of eastern europe  primarily in the czech republic and the russian federation 
we also offer sales  installation and servicing of atm and point of sale pos terminals and selected card issuing services  including card management and card personalization  which are components of indirect merchant services  through global payments europe and ucs 
direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value  whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a specified fee per transaction or per service rendered 
in both merchant services models  we also charge other fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value 
credit and debit card transaction processing the credit and debit networks consist of member financial institutions  who establish uniform regulations that govern much of the industry 
during a typical card transaction  the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other  but instead rely on merchant acquirers 
merchant acquirers are typically financial institutions or independent processors  such as global payments 
global payments performs a series of services including authorization  electronic draft capture  file transfers to facilitate the funds settlement and certain exception based  back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 
electronic draft capture is the process of transferring sales draft data into an electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement 
the card networks  primarily visa and mastercard  use a system known as interchange  in the case of credit and signature debit cards 
financial institutions use the debit networks  for pin debit cards  to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and us to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
debit card payments differ slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction  or the debit card transaction will not be authorized 
pin based debit transactions are sent through a debit network  while signature based debit  or check card transactions  which are offered exclusively in the united states  are sent through visa and mastercard and require a signature at the time of purchase 
also  pin based debit transactions typically deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder s deposit account within a day of the purchase  depending on the time of the purchase 
signature based debit  or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder s deposit account two to three days after the purchase  although the funds are held with a memo posted to the cardholder s bank account 
a credit card transaction posts to a cardholder s account  reducing the available credit limit in a similar manner 
in order to provide credit and signature based debit card transaction processing services  we must be designated as a certified processor by mastercard and visa  in addition to a merchant service provider by mastercard and an independent sales organization by visa 
these designations are dependent upon member clearing banks of either organization sponsoring us and our adherence to the standards of the visa and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements mastercard networks 
a financial institution that is a member of the visa and or mastercard card networks the member must sponsor an electronic transaction payment processor such as global payments 
we have five primary financial institution sponsors in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the asia pacific region and the russian federation with whom we have sponsorship or depository and processing agreements 
these agreements allow us to route transactions under the member banks control and identification numbers to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard 
visa and mastercard set the standards with which we must comply 
we also provide credit card transaction processing for discover financial services or discover card discover and are designated as an acquirer by discover 
this designation provides us with a direct relationship between us and discover  and therefore a member sponsorship is not required 
our agreement with discover allows us to route and clear transactions directly through discover s network 
otherwise  we process discover transactions similarly to how we process mastercard and visa transactions 
discover publishes acquirer operating regulations  with which we must comply 
we use our members to assist in funding merchants for discover transactions 
how a card transaction works a card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a pos terminal card reader  which may be provided by global payments 
alternatively  card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device by one of a number of products that we offer directly or through a value added reseller var 
for a credit card transaction  authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits 
the terminal electronically records sales draft information  such as the credit card identification number  transaction date and value of the goods or services purchased 
after the card and transaction information is captured by the pos device  the terminal automatically either dials a pre programmed phone number or otherwise connects to our network  through the internet or a leased line  in order to receive authorization of the transaction 
we route the request to the applicable credit or debit network 
the credit or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer  who determines a response based on the status of the cardholder s account 
the response is returned to the merchant s terminal via the same communication network 
this entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds 
timing differences  interchange expenses  merchant reserves and exception items cause differences between the amount the member receives from the card networks and the amount funded to the merchants 
the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds  and  instead  require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant is funded 
however  in practice and in accordance with the terms of our sponsorship agreements with our members  we generally follow a net settlement process whereby  if the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member s funding obligation to the merchant  we temporarily hold the surplus on behalf of the member  in a joint deposit account or in an account at the member bank  and record a corresponding liability 
conversely  if the member s funding obligation to the merchant precedes the incoming amount from the card networks  the amount of the member s net receivable position is either subsequently advanced to the member by us or the member satisfies this obligation with its own funds 
if the member uses its own funds  the member assesses a funding cost 
each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for its services 
as an illustration  on a credit card transaction  the card issuer may fund the member after retaining approximately referred to as an interchange fee or interchange expense 
the card issuer seeks reimbursement of from the cardholder in the cardholder s monthly credit card bill 
the member would  in turn  pay the merchant 
the net settlement after this transaction would require global payments to advance to the member 
after the end of the month  we would bill the merchant a percentage of the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements transaction  or discount  to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our net revenue from the transaction 
if our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was  we would bill the merchant at the end of the month for the transaction  reimburse ourselves for approximately in interchange fees and retain as our net revenue for the transaction 
our gross profit on the transaction reflects the net revenue less operating expenses  including the network and systems cost to process the transaction including assessments and commissions paid to our sales force or iso 
assessments are fees charged by visa and mastercard based on the dollar value of transactions processed through their networks 
north america merchant services segment north america merchant services represent of our total consolidated fiscal revenues and include operations in the united states and canada 
in the us we sell our services via isos  a direct sales force  trade associations  agent and var referral arrangements  as well as proprietary telesales groups 
our iso channel targets a variety of merchant types with a typical annual bankcard volume of  or less 
the isos contract with global payments to provide processing and other services depending on the isos requirements 
these contracts are multi year and priced by service on a per transaction basis 
the isos act as a third party sales group selling global payments branded merchant acquiring products and services  with the majority of global s isos marketing direct merchant acquiring 
because global payments is a primary party to the contract as a result of the company s bank sponsor relationship  the full amount of revenue collected from the merchant is recorded as revenue 
the excess of revenue earned over the iso contractual transaction fee plus assessments is remitted to the iso in the form of a residual payment on a monthly basis and is recorded in sales  general and administrative expenses 
our direct sales channel receives qualified leads from our agent bank  var and trade association referral partners signing a variety of mid to large sized merchants with annual bankcard volume above  our sales force is paid a combination of base salary  commission and benefits 
our united states revenue also includes check and gaming services and indirect merchant services 
our check products offer merchant customers risk management alternatives  in the case of our verification and recovery offerings  or risk elimination  in the case of our guarantee offerings  by leveraging our internal and external databases of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter 
our check services products are part of our domestic direct service offering 
check guarantee services include comprehensive check verification and guarantee services designed for a merchant s specific needs and risk adversity 
this service offering guarantees payment of all checks that are electronically verified 
if a verified check is dishonored  our check guarantee service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check s face value  and then we pursue collection of the check through our internal collection services 
while we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter  we have historically recovered less than of the guaranteed checks 
we derive revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check 
check verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service  except that these services do not guarantee payment of the verified checks 
we derive revenues for these services primarily from the service fees collected from delinquent check writers  fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check  and fees charged to merchants for specialized services  such as electronic re deposits of dishonored checks 
in the specialized vertical market of gaming  our vip lightspeed proprietary software and vip preferred advantage product provide the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for the casinos customers 
our gaming products allow fast access to cash with high limits so that gaming establishments can increase the flow of money to their gaming floors and reduce risk 
we derive revenue from our gaming products primarily based on a percentage of the transaction value

money transfer segment our money transfer segment provides consumer money transfer services 
revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our electronic money transfer services marketed under our dolex brand to first and second generation latin americans living in the united states 
this segment regularly transfers money to family and friends living in latin america 
following the europhil acquisition in december  we expanded our money transfer origination locations to europe and our settlement locations to morocco  the philippines  romania and poland 
money transfer represents percent of our total consolidated fiscal revenues 
in a typical money transfer transaction  a customer visits one of our originating branch locations and pays a fee based on the nature and amount of the transaction performed on the customer s behalf 
where applicable  the customer is quoted a retail foreign currency exchange rate when the money transfer transaction is requested 
the customer will receive a receipt that includes the amount the beneficiary will receive  the retail exchange rate  money transfer fee  settlement location and total amount that was remitted to us 
we earn additional revenue based on the difference between the retail exchange rate that is quoted and the wholesale exchange rate when the currency is purchased  which is in much larger denominations than the individual customer s transaction 
on each business day  we estimate the amount of currency needed by our settlement locations  bid the wholesale exchange rates based on the amount needed and purchase currency at the best available rates

table of contents 
index to financial statements industry overview and target markets industry overview payment processing service providers offer high volume electronic transaction payment processing and support services directly to financial institutions  merchants  multinational corporations  government agencies and isos 
generally  the payment processing market in the united states and canada continues to transition from traditional financial institution providers to independent merchant acquirers  such as global payments 
we believe merchants seek more efficient distribution channels  as well as increased technological capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation  processing  handling  storage  and retrieval of information 
based on the nilson report  dated march  we are a leading mid market and small market merchant acquirer in the united states and we directly compete with chase paymentech  first data corporation  and bank of america merchant services 
according to that report chase paymentech is the largest electronic transaction payment processor in the united states 
in canada  we have a significant market share with the largest company being moneris solutions 
moneris solutions is a joint venture between the royal bank of canada and the bank of montreal 
we also consider chase paymentech solutions and td merchant services to be major competitors in the canadian market 
in the european and asia pacific regions  financial institutions remain the dominant providers of payment processing services to merchants  although the outsourcing of merchant processing services to third party service providers is becoming more prevalent 
throughout all markets  processing services have become increasingly complex  requiring significant capital commitments to develop  maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price 
our primary competitors within the united kingdom are the royal bank of scotland and barclays 
the russian federation payments market is highly fragmented and our competition is made up of various financial institutions  including sberbank and russian standard bank 
in the czech republic  our primary competitors for processing are first data  sinsys  and euronet 
in the asia pacific region  our primary competition is from financial institutions that offer merchant acquiring services as well as merchant solutions  which is a joint venture between first data and standard chartered plc 
as a result of continued growth in our industry  several large merchant acquirers  including us  have expanded operations both domestically and internationally 
this expansion has come in the form of acquisitions and the creation of alliances and joint ventures 
we believe that the electronic payment transaction processing and money transfer industries will continue to consolidate as banks and independent processors that do not have the necessary infrastructure to participate in a highly competitive environment look to exit the business 
in the canadian market  visa  mastercard and interac are planning to migrate to cards containing chip technology over the coming years 
chip technology provides the ability to process payment transactions securely by protecting the cardholder information in an encrypted and confidential manner 
the chip is difficult to copy and has the additional capacity to be personalized by a card issuer  including the ability to be programmed with spending and usage limits  making it possible to authorize some transactions off line 
chip technology can also help enable a variety of additional card features including applications such as loyalty  access control  rewards and public transit passes 
we expect that it will take multiple years for all participants to implement the computer equipment and merchant terminals necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions in the canadian marketplace 
we have developed a long term plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the canadian market 
in addition  we have begun to deploy chip card capable terminals in the canadian market 
chip card technology is already prevalent in the european and asia pacific markets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we also provide electronic money transfer services to consumers in the united states and europe who send money to latin america  morocco  the philippines  romania  poland and other destinations 
unlike our major competitors in the latin american corridor that operate an agent based network  we generally utilize a branch owned network strategy at the point of sale 
we believe that this differentiation allows us to be more flexible and competitive when setting our prices and introducing new products and services 
we believe the number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies 
to help our customers reduce their transaction costs and speed up the transaction approval process  we have integrated new technologies into our service offerings such as internet protocol communications and check truncation or conversion at the point of sale 
if new technologies like radio frequency identification or contactless payment cards continue to evolve and are desired by merchants and consumers  we plan to continue developing new products and services that will exploit the benefits that these new technologies can offer our customers 
we also believe that new emerging markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper based transactions 
industries such as quick service restaurants  government  recurring payments  and business to business should continue to see transaction volumes migrate to more electronic based settlement solutions 
we believe that the continued development of new products and services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business for the foreseeable future 
target markets we believe that significant global opportunities exist for continued growth in the application of electronic transaction payment processing and money transfer services 
although the united states accounts for the largest payment processing volume in the world  global expansion by financial institutions into new geographies and the increased recognition by governments of the ability of payment cards to facilitate economic growth are rapidly transforming the electronic commerce market into a global opportunity 
the growth of retail credit card transactions  as well as the rapid growth in the utilization of debit cards  directly correlates with the historic growth of our business 
according to the nilson report dated may  worldwide annual general purpose card purchase volume increased to trillion in general purpose cards include the major card networks brands such as mastercard  visa  american express  discover  diners club and jcb 
in canada  general purpose cards also include interac debit cards 
the nilson report dated may estimates that more than trillion of annual consumer spending was charged in using general purpose cards in the united states  a increase from based on the nilson report dated april  the united states industry mix of visa and mastercard debit and credit purchase transactions are approximately and  respectively 
the nilson report dated february reported that billion us of annual canadian consumer spending uses general purpose cards as the form of payment  representing an increase of over also based on the nilson report dated february  the canadian industry mix of visa and mastercard credit cards and interac debit cards purchase transactions are approximately and  respectively 
the nilson report dated may estimates that trillion of annual consumer spending was charged in using general purpose cards in europe  a increase from the industry mix in the united kingdom  based on the united kingdom purchase transaction payments authority apacs for visa and mastercard debit and credit cards are approximately and  respectively 
we process in eleven countries and territories in the asia pacific region 
this market includes almost of the world s population and of the total asia pacific population according to the cia world factbook 
these markets are largely cash based 
we believe there are significant  long term growth opportunities for payment processing in this market 
the growth rate of remittances from the united states to latin america has decreased over the past year  primarily due to a slowing united states economy  a downturn in the united states housing and construction markets  and increased enforcement of immigration policies

index to financial statements strategy in pursuing our business strategy  we seek to leverage the rapid adoption of and transition to card based payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in north america  asia pacific and europe  and investing in and leveraging technology and people  thereby maximizing shareholder value 
we intend to accomplish this overall strategy as follows existing offerings in pursuing this business strategy  we intend to increase our penetration of existing markets and to further leverage our infrastructure 
our objectives to execute this strategy include the following expand our direct merchant services distribution channels  primarily our existing sales force  isos  oems  vars and other referral relationships  provide the best possible customer service at levels that exceed our competitors by investing in technology  training and product enhancements  grow our direct merchant services market share in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the asia pacific region and the russian federation by concentrating on the small and mid market merchant segments  provide the latest  secure and enhanced products and services by developing value added applications  enhancing existing products and developing new systems and services to blend technology with our customer needs  and focus on potential domestic and international acquisitions or investments and alliances with companies that have high growth potential or significant market presence and operate in profitable sectors of payments related industries through compatible products and services  and development and distribution capabilities 
international markets we intend to focus on further diversification in international markets with high payments industry growth  such as europe and the asia pacific region 
we may expand our direct merchant services and indirect merchant services offerings into these markets  either organically or through acquisitions 
we are evaluating these markets due to the following attractive characteristics currently low but growing credit and debit card utilization  a target with significant market share presence  or the absence of a dominant merchant acquirer or processor 
infrastructure our focus on the existing infrastructure will center on attracting  developing and retaining talent to execute our strategy and migrate our systems to leading edge technology 
we intend to continue systems integrations  primarily the consolidation of both our front and back end operating platforms 
we continue to make progress on our next generation technology processing platform  referred to as g this platform is planned to be a new front end operating environment for our merchant processing in the united states  asia pacific  the united kingdom  and canada  and is intended to replace several legacy platforms that have higher cost structures 
aside from cost advantages  there are many other benefits to this new platform  such as increased speed to market of new products  ease of scalability  enhanced reporting options  hardware environment flexibility  and compliance with emv and pci standards 
in addition  the platform is being designed as a potential integration platform for future acquisitions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements compliance money transfer licensing and regulations we are subject to various united states federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the sale of payment instruments  such as official checks and money orders 
in the united states  most states license consumer money transfer service providers and issuers of money orders such as dolex 
the applicable state statutes and regulations typically require dolex to obtain and maintain certain required licenses as a condition to performing these activities 
these statutes and regulations vary  but generally require dolex to do the following a satisfy minimum net worth and other financial covenant requirements  b periodically submit information regarding financial results  changes in corporate documentation or ownership  insurance  and other relevant information  c procure and maintain a surety bond with minimum statutory levels of coverage  d demonstrate the character and fitness of the officers and directors of dolex  and e be subject to periodic financial and operational audits 
the state licenses have varying renewal periods 
certain licenses have a specific term of one or more years and require renewals at the end of such term  while others remain in effect unless revoked 
the money transfer service offering also is subject to regulation by various agencies of the federal government that are charged with implementing and enforcing anti money laundering laws and regulations  including the bank secrecy act  as amended by the usa patriot act of  collectively referred to as the bsa 
the bsa  among other things  requires money transfer companies to develop and implement risk based anti money laundering programs  report large cash transactions and suspicious activity  and maintain transaction records 
in addition  certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the treasury department s office of foreign assets control  or ofac  prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries  their governments  and in certain circumstances  their nationals  and with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries  narcotics traffickers  and terrorists or terrorist organizations 
global payments european money transfer companies  created through europhil  our acquisition in december  are regulated by various governmental agencies in spain  and the united kingdom in their money transfer activities 
prior to its acquisition by global payments  europhil received approval from these governmental agencies to act as a money transfer service provider 
the requirements of these governmental agencies vary  but generally require europhil to do the following a satisfy minimum share capital requirements  b periodically submit information regarding financial results  changes in corporate documentation or ownership  insurance  and other relevant information  c register and maintain transaction information  d maintain adequate insurance coverage  e ensure the transparency of the conditions of the transactions to its customers  f implement safeguards and restrictions to prevent money laundering  and g subject itself to periodic audits 
in addition  the money transfer service offerings are subject to regulation in the settlement countries in which dolex and europhil offer their services 
these regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services  limitations on the amount of principal that can be moved into or out of a country  limitations on the number of money transfers that may be received by a customer  limitations on the exchange rates between foreign currencies  and regulations intended to help detect and prevent money laundering 
dolex and europhil have developed compliance programs to monitor regulatory requirements and developments and to implement policies and procedures to help satisfy these requirements in each origination and settlement jurisdiction 
in addition  dolex and europhil s use of a branch network for the origination of electronic money transfers  rather than an agent model typically utilized by our larger competitors  allows for greater control over regulatory compliance  as our customers interface at the point of sale with dolex and europhil employees  rather than the employees of third party agents

index to financial statements item a risk factors our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship 
in order to provide our transaction processing services  we must be registered as a merchant processor of mastercard and visa 
these designations are dependent upon our being sponsored by member clearing banks of both organizations and our continuing adherence to the visa and mastercard standards 
there are a limited number of member clearing banks worldwide that are willing to sponsor merchant processors  such as us  and attaining new sponsorship agreements is difficult 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with these standards  our designation as a registered merchant processor of mastercard and visa could be suspended or terminated 
the termination of any of these designations  the loss of any of our five primary sponsor banks  or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would likely result in the loss of merchant customers and lead to a material reduction in our revenues and earnings 
loss of key independent sales organizations could reduce our revenue growth 
our iso sales channel  which purchases and resells our end to end services to its own portfolio of merchant customers  is a strong contributor to our revenue growth in our north america merchant services segment 
if an iso switches to another transaction processor  shuts down or becomes insolvent  we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso 
in addition  we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso 
consequently  if we lose a key iso  our revenues and earnings could be negatively affected 
risks associated with operations outside the united states could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates because of our significant international operations  as well as our significant electronic money transfer operations in the united states  latin america and europe 
volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 
for example  for fiscal year  currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by million and our earnings by per diluted share 
we do not use forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the risks associated with currency exchange risk 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency 
we are subject to the risk that currency exchange rates between these regions and the united states will fluctuate  potentially resulting in a loss of some of our revenue and earnings when such amounts are exchanged into united states dollars 
we also have significant money transfer operations in the united states  latin america and europe which subject us to foreign currency exchange risks as our customers deposit funds in the local currencies of the originating countries where our branches are located  and we typically deliver funds denominated in the home country currencies to each of our settlement locations 
in addition  in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currency into united states dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions

companies who are larger than we are have greater financial and operational resources than we have 
this may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers  which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well 
either of these actions could have a significant effect on our revenues and earnings 
in addition  our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies  including internet payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable to customers  again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our offerings 
lastly  our competitors may be willing or able to pay more than us for acquisitions  which may cause us to lose certain acquisitions that we would otherwise desire to complete 
our money transfer service offerings are dependent on financial institutions to provide such offerings 
our money transfer service offerings involve transferring funds internationally and are dependent upon foreign and domestic financial institutions  including our competitors  to execute funds transfers and foreign currency transactions 
changes to existing regulations of financial institution operations  such as those designed to combat terrorism or money laundering  could require us to change our operational procedures in such a way that might increase our costs of doing business or could require us to terminate certain product offerings 
in addition  as a result of existing regulations and or changes to such regulations  financial institutions could decide to cease providing the services on which we depend entirely  requiring us to terminate certain product offerings in specifically impacted markets 
in the future  the inability to purchase these services from significant regional or national financial institutions would likely result in a material reduction to our money transfer revenue and earnings 
we are subject to the business cycles and credit risk of our merchant customers and  to a lesser extent  consumer checkwriters 
the current recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings  resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us 
our merchants are liable for any charges properly reversed by the card issuer on behalf of the cardholder 
our merchants and isos are also liable for any fines  or penalties  that may be assessed by any card networks 
in the event  however  that we are not able to collect such amounts from the merchants  due to merchant fraud  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such charges  resulting in lower earnings for us 
we process billions of dollars in annual volume that are subject to these risks 
the current recessionary economic environment could also cause checkwriters to dishonor a greater number of checks issued to our merchant customers 
if we are unable to collect the face value of these checks  we may incur higher losses and lower earnings 
in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings  we must continually update our products and services  a process which could result in increased research and development costs in excess of historical levels and the loss of revenues  earnings and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 
the electronic payments and money transfer markets in which we compete include a wide range of products and services including electronic transaction payment processing  money transfer  transaction reporting and other customer support services 
these markets are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  
table of contents 
index to financial statements evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
in order to remain competitive  we are continually involved in a number of research and development projects including the development of a new front end platform for electronic payments processing 
these projects carry the risks associated with any research and development effort  including cost overruns  delays in delivery and performance problems 
in the electronic payments and money transfer markets these risks are even more acute 
our markets are constantly experiencing rapid technological change 
any delay in the delivery of new products or services could render them less desirable to our customers  or possibly even obsolete 
in addition  the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments and money transfer markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions  all at very high volumes and processing speeds 
any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors 
as a result of these factors  our research and development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenue and earnings if promised new products are not timely delivered to our customers or do not perform as anticipated 
security breaches or system failures could harm our reputation and adversely affect future earnings 
we handle personal consumer data  such as names  credit and debit account numbers  checking account numbers and payment history records 
we process that data and deliver our products and services by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated both by us and by third party service providers 
although plans and procedures are in place to protect this sensitive data and to prevent failure of  and to provide backup for  our systems  we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful 
a security breach or other misuse of such data  or failures of key operating systems and their back ups  could harm our reputation and deter customers from using our products and services  increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures  expose us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability  increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny including the imposition of penalties and fines under state  federal and foreign laws  and adversely affect our continued visa and mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship 
changes in state  federal and foreign laws and regulations affecting the electronic money transfer industry might make it more difficult for our customers to initiate money transfers  which would adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
if state  federal or foreign authorities adopt new regulations or raise enforcement levels on existing regulations that make it more difficult for our customers to initiate  or their beneficiaries to receive  electronic money transfers  then our revenues and earnings may be negatively affected 
this particular topic has been widely debated in the united states at both the state and federal levels  with a currently unclear outcome 
any regulation or enforcement practices that are more restrictive than historical levels that relate to latin american immigrants  including those who are not legal residents of the united states  could adversely impact our electronic money transfer revenue and earnings 
changes in immigration patterns can adversely affect our revenues and earnings from electronic money transfers 
our electronic money transfer business primarily focuses on customers who immigrate to the united states from latin american countries in order to find higher paying jobs and then send a portion of their earnings to family members in latin america 
in addition  our electronic money transfer business also focuses on customers who immigrate to spain from latin american countries  morocco  the philippines  romania  poland and other countries 
any changes in these immigration patterns for any reason  including government policies or enforcement or deteriorating economic conditions which reverse immigration patterns  may negatively affect the number of immigrants in the united states  spain and any new countries in which we expand our money transfer service offering in the future  which may reduce our customer base and our corresponding revenues and earnings 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in order for us to continue to grow and increase our profitability  we must continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments and money transfer markets and also expand into new markets 
our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate  the further expansion of these markets  the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing  including internet payment systems  and our ability to penetrate these markets 
as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion  we are continually looking for acquisition opportunities  investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration  technological capabilities  product offerings and distribution capabilities 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition  investment and alliance candidates in the future  and if we do  they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated 
once completed  investments and alliances may not realize the value that we expect 
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market 
we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets 
if we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments and money transfer markets  we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 
any changes made to laws  regulations  card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results 
there may be changes in the laws  regulations  card network rules or other industry standards that affect the way we do business 
in the united states  legislation has recently been introduced at the federal level to regulate the fees charged to merchants for card processing services 
we are unable to predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted or whether any card network rule or other industry standard will change 
furthermore  we cannot predict the impact of any of these changes on our operations and financial condition 
these changes may require significant efforts to change our systems and products and may require changes to how we price our services to customers 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations  and standards may impact our ability to do business and jeopardize our card network registration and financial institution sponsorship 
increases in credit card network fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our earnings 
from time to time  the credit card networks  including visa and mastercard  increase the fees interchange and assessment fees that they charge processors such as us 
we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers  but this strategy might result in the loss of those customers to our competitors who do not pass along the increases 
if competitive practices prevent our passing along such increased fees to our merchant customers in the future  we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings 
utility and system interruptions or processing errors could adversely affect our operations 
in order to process transactions promptly  our computer equipment and network servers must be functional on a hour basis  which requires access to telecommunications facilities and the availability of electricity 
furthermore  with respect to certain processing services  we are dependent on the systems and services of third party vendors 
telecommunications services and the electricity supply are susceptible to disruption 
computer system interruptions and other processing errors  whether involving our own systems or the systems operated by our third party vendors  may result from such disruption or from human error or other unrelated causes 
any extensive or long term disruptions in our processing services could cause us to incur substantial additional expense and the loss of customers  which could have an adverse affect on our operations and financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the integration of our acquired operations  or other future acquisitions  if any  could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating both businesses as one are not achieved  a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process  and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 
the integration of these businesses with ours presents several challenges  including the fact that they may be based in the regions where we do not currently have operations 
if the integration process does not proceed smoothly  the following factors could reduce our revenues and earnings  increase our operating costs  and or result in a loss of projected synergies if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans  duties and responsibilities  and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business  we could lose employees to our competitors in the region  which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration  if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services  or the quality of those services  we could lose customers to our competitors  which would reduce our revenues and earnings  and the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new electronic payments markets 
continued consolidation in the banking and retail industries could adversely affect our growth 
the current recessionary environment has resulted in multiple bank failures and government encouraged consolidation 
as banks continue to consolidate  our ability to offer our services through indirect channels successfully will depend in part on whether the institutions that survive are willing to outsource their credit and debit card processing to third party vendors and whether those institutions have pre existing relationships with any of our competitors 
larger banks and larger merchants with greater transaction volumes may demand lower fees which could result in lower revenues and earnings for us 
loss of strategic industries could reduce revenues and earnings 
although our merchant acquiring portfolio is well diversified and neither one economic sector nor any customer concentration represents a significant portion of our business  a decrease in strategic industries could cause us to lose significant revenues and earnings 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the rapidly changing transaction processing and money transfer industries  and the selected markets in which we offer our services 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our key personnel would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage  and retain additional qualified management and technical personnel as we grow 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel 
our financial results may be adversely affected if we have to impair our intangible assets or goodwill 
as a result of our acquisitions  a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets including goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets  net of amortization  together accounted for approximately and of the total assets on our balance sheet as of may  and may   respectively 
we may not realize the full fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill 
we expect to engage in additional acquisitions  
table of contents 
index to financial statements which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill 
under current accounting standards  we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset  while goodwill is not amortized 
we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired 
under current accounting rules  any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets  resulting in a charge to our earnings 
such a write off could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million in our money transfer business resulting from our annual goodwill impairment test 
risks associated with reduced levels of consumer spending could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
significant portions of our revenue and earnings are derived from fees from processing consumer credit card and debit card transactions and electronic money transfer transactions 
we are exposed to general economic conditions that effect consumer confidence  consumer spending  consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits 
a general reduction in consumer spending in the united states or any other country where we do business could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
for example  in fiscal year compared to the prior year  our united states direct credit card average dollar value of transaction  or average ticket  decreased in the high single single digit percentage range 
we believe this decline  while partially due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our isos  was in part driven by lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy  and we expect this trend to continue 
we may become subject to additional united states  state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchant services or money transfer customers  in which case our earnings could be adversely affected 
payment processing companies like us may be subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or certain portions of our fees charged to customers for our services 
application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on this topic 
if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax expense through to our merchant customers  our costs will increase  reducing our earnings 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
further  this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we may complete 
in the united kingdom and certain markets in the asia pacific region  hsbc performs payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to transition services agreements 
we expect that hsbc will continue to provide these services until we integrate these functions into our operations 
until we can integrate the acquisitions financial reporting functions into our own  we will rely on hsbc to provide financial data  such as revenue billed to merchants  to assist us with compiling our accounting records 
accordingly  our internal controls over financial reporting could be materially affected  or are reasonably likely to be materially affected  by hsbc internal controls and procedures 
in order to mitigate this risk  we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting which monitor the accuracy of the financial data being provided by hsbc 
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market s perception of our business and our stock price

index to financial statements anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  our rights agreement and provisions of georgia law could delay or prevent a change of control that individual shareholders favor 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  our rights agreement and provisions of applicable georgia law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable 
the provisions of our articles and by laws  among other things divide our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected in staggered three year terms  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
we may not be able to or we may decide not to pay dividends or repurchase shares at a level anticipated by shareholders on our common stock  which could reduce shareholder returns 
the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares are at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to our financial results  our working capital requirements  the availability of acquisitions and other business opportunities  the availability of surplus funds  interest rate levels  debt covenants  our stock price levels and restrictions under financing agreements 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends or repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future 
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense 
we have established contingent liabilities for tax exposures relating to deductions  transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority 
while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability 
an unfavorable resolution  therefore  could negatively impact our results of operations 
we conduct a portion of our business in various latin american  eastern european and asia pacific countries  and the russian federation  where the risk of continued political  economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the united states 
we expect to continue to expand our operations into various countries in latin america  eastern europe  and the asia pacific regions 
some of these countries  and other foreign countries in which we operate  have undergone significant political  economic and social change in recent years  and the risk of new  unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the united states 
in particular  changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations  whether caused by a change in government or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in many countries
