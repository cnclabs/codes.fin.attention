for more information regarding our business segments  see item business of this annual report 
business update general economic conditions continue to impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending patterns across the states in which we operate 
customers in both of our businesses are increasingly value conscious and price sensitive 
accordingly  we have undertaken a number of initiatives designed to highlight the value propositions we offer customers in a number of areas such as exclusive product offerings and the delivery of customized technology solutions at competitive prices 
forward looking  we believe that a combination of economic and regulatory factors and the potential of higher fuel prices could adversely affect our sales  gross margins  and operating profits into the foreseeable future 
however  we are hopeful that our conservative strategy of cost containment  aggressively targeting new business  and maintaining maximum liquidity  will position us well to capture market share  execute strategic acquisitions and open new retail stores and ultimately increase shareholder value 
business update wholesale distribution segment the wholesale distribution industry is mature and continues to be intensely competitive 
we expect future sales and profitability will be pressured by a number of prominent trends declining revenue streams historically  cigarette and tobacco products have represented one of the largest sales categories for convenience stores and their distributors alike 
recent legislative actions such as excise tax increases  smoking bans  as well as a general decline in the number of smokers in the united states  has decreased demand for these products 
in april  significant increases in the federal excise taxes were imposed on cigarette and tobacco products in conjunction with the state children s health insurance program law schip 
additionally  in june new legislation was signed into law which provided the fda with broad new authority to regulate the manufacture  distribution  marketing  and sale of cigarette and tobacco products 
in one of its first major regulatory actions  the fda banned the manufacture  shipment  and sale of certain flavored cigarettes effective september  on a long term basis  we believe these factors will reduce the demand for cigarette and tobacco products  while at the same time increasing the company s inventory carrying costs and customer credit risk 
gross profit erosion efforts to retain and capture market share have prompted aggressive pricing and have resulted in gross profit erosion industry wide 

table of contents we believe the long term implications of these trends may be detrimental to smaller distributors 
a combination of declining revenue streams  gross profit erosion  and limited access to credit and or new capital may force many distributors from the market  resulting in substantial industry consolidation 
as one of the nation s largest wholesale distributors  we believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on these trends and expand our strategic footprint 
business update retail health food segment sales in our retail health food segment have been negatively impacted by weaknesses in both of our geographic markets 
in particular  sales in our florida stores have been hurt by the severe economic downturn in that state  in addition to increased competition from other natural food chains 
in the near term  our retail segment faces a challenging operating environment as consumer behavior has been adversely impacted by the recession 
in response  we have worked to better align our cost structure to demand  while reemphasizing the value choices found throughout our stores  such as our private label offerings and other product lines unique to our stores 
despite the impact of the recession  we believe the long term prospects for this segment remain attractive and we will continue to pursue growth through ongoing evaluations of potential new locations 
if health food retailers can demonstrate value and provide consumers with affordable choices  we believe overall demand for natural food products will rebound as the current adverse economic conditions dissipate

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth an analysis of various components of the company s statement of operations as a percentage of sales for fiscal years and fiscal years sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income preferred stock dividend requirements net income available to common shareholders fiscal years incr in millions decr change consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit gross profit percentage operating expense operating income interest expense income tax expense income from continuing operations business segments wholesale sales gross profit gross profit percentage retail sales gross profit gross profit percentage sales are reported net of costs associated with incentives provided to retailers 
these incentives totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal amounts calculated based on actual change in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents sales fiscal vs 
fiscal continuing operations changes in sales are driven by two primary components i changes to selling prices  which are largely controlled by our product suppliers  and state and federal excise taxes imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products  and ii changes in the volume of products sold to our customers  either due to a change in purchasing patterns resulting from consumer preferences or the fluctuation in the comparable number of business days in our reporting period 
sales in our wholesale distribution segment increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this change included a million increase in cigarette sales and a net million increase in sales of tobacco  beverages  snacks  candy  grocery  health beauty products  automotive  food service  and store supplies categories other products 
significant items impacting our fiscal wholesale segment sales included million increase in cigarette sales due to price increases implemented by manufacturers  partially offset by a million decrease in cigarette sales  primarily resulting from a reduction in cigarette cartons sold as compared fiscal according to studies by the american wholesale marketers association  the demand for cigarettes has been declining since during fiscal  we believe the collective impact of economic conditions  smoking bans  and a dramatic increase in the federal excise taxes imposed on cigarettes  accelerated declining demand trends for cigarettes 
we expect that overall demand for cigarettes will continue to decline into the foreseeable future based on the aforementioned considerations and the prospect of more restrictive fda regulations  which may include aggressive bans on the sale of certain cigarette and tobacco products 
million net increase in our other products category sales as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher tobacco and confectionary sales 
sales in our retail health food segment decreased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily related to lower sales volumes in our highly perishable and refrigerated food categories  particularly in our florida retail stores  which have been impacted by a severe regional economic downturn and increased competition from other natural food chains 
gross profit fiscal vs 
fiscal continuing operations our gross profit does not include fulfillment costs and costs related to the distribution network which are included in selling  general and administrative costs  and may not be comparable to those of other entities 
some entities may classify such costs as a component of cost of sales 
cost of sales  a component used in determining gross profit  for the wholesale and retail segments includes the cost of products purchased from manufacturers  less incentives we receive which are netted against such costs 
gross profit in our wholesale segment increased million in fiscal as compared to the same prior year period 
during fiscal  our wholesale gross profit benefitted by approximately million primarily due to improved margins resulting from price increases by cigarette and tobacco manufacturers 
offsetting this increase  was million decrease in gross profit primarily due to the net impact of lower cigarette carton volumes and changes in both promotional allowances and product mix sold 
the company has benefitted over the past fiscal year from improved profit margins on cigarette and tobacco products 
on a long term basis  however  we believe our gross profit margins will revert back to historical norms based on declining demand trends and competitive pressures industry wide 
gross profit for the retail health segment decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily related to lower sales volume 
operating expense fiscal vs 
fiscal continuing operations operating expense includes selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include costs related to our sales  warehouse  delivery and 
table of contents administrative departments for all segments 
specifically  purchasing and receiving costs  warehousing costs and costs of picking and loading customer orders are all classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
our most significant expenses relate to employee costs  facility and equipment leases  transportation costs  fuel costs  insurance  and professional fees 
operating expenses decreased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal significant items impacting operating expenses included a million increase in compensation costs and a million increase in health insurance costs 
these items were offset by a million decrease in fuel costs  a million decrease in depreciation expense  and a million reduction in other operating expenses 
interest expense fiscal vs 
fiscal continuing operations fiscal interest expense decreased million as compared to fiscal this change was principally related to lower interest rates and average borrowings on the company s credit facility 
in fiscal  the company s average interest rates and average borrowings on its revolving credit facility were and million lower  respectively  as compared to fiscal discontinued operations fiscal vs 
fiscal in may  trinity springs  inc tsi  a wholly owned subsidiary and former component of the company s beverage segment  and crystal paradise holdings  inc cph closed a transaction whereby cph exchanged a million note receivable plus million of accrued interest which it held and was due from tsi  for the operating assets of tsi 
the company will have no continuing involvement in the related operating assets and has recorded a million pre tax gain million after tax in conjunction with the transaction  which included the recognition of a million deferred gain attributable to a previously executed mutual release and settlement agreement between amcon  tsi  and cph 
the million gain has been reflected in the statement of operations as a component of discontinued operations 
simultaneous with the closing of the cph transaction discussed above  the company fully settled and satisfied million in related party notes payable and accrued interest totaling million due from tsi  in exchange for cash payments of approximately million 
the company has recorded a million pre tax gain million after tax related to this transaction  which has been reflected in the statements of operations as a component of discontinued operations 
a summary of discontinued operations is as follows dollars in millions year ended september operating loss interest expense gain on asset disposal and debt settlement income tax expense benefit gain loss from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources overview operating activities 
the company requires cash to pay operating expenses  purchase inventory  and make capital investments 
in general  the company finances its cash flow requirements with cash generated from operating activities and credit facility borrowings 
during fiscal  the company generated cash of approximately million from operating activities 
the cash generated resulted from higher overall earnings  reductions in inventory and prepaid asset balances  and increases in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 

table of contents our variability in cash flows from operating activities is dependent on the timing of inventory purchases and seasonal fluctuations 
for example  periodically we have inventory buy in opportunities which offer more favorable pricing terms 
as a result  we may have to hold inventory for a period longer than the payment terms 
this generates a cash outflow from operating activities which we expect to reverse in later periods 
additionally  during the warm weather months  which is our peak time of operations  we generally carry higher amounts of inventory to ensure high fill rates and customer satisfaction 
investing activities 
the company used approximately million of cash during fiscal for investing activities  primarily related to capital expenditures for property and equipment 
financing activities 
the company used cash of million for financing activities during fiscal of this amount  million related to net payments on the company s credit facility  million related to the redemption of the company s series c convertible preferred stock  million related to principal payments on long term debt  million related to dividends on the company s common and preferred stock  and million related to principal payments on long term debt classified as discontinued operations 
offsetting these items was million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
cash on hand working capital 
as of september  the company had cash on hand of million and working capital current assets less current liabilities of million 
this compares to cash on hand of million and working capital of million at september during the fiscal year the company paid down its revolving credit facility by million with earnings and cash generated through improved inventory management which had the impact of reducing working capital 
credit agreement the company has a credit agreement the facility with bank of america  which includes the following significant terms a june maturity date 
a million revolving credit limit  plus the outstanding balance on term note a 
term note a had an outstanding balance of million at september  the facility bears interest at either the bank s prime rate or at libor plus basis points  at the election of the company 
the facility provides for an additional million of credit available for certain inventory purchases 
these advances bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus one quarter of one percent per annum and are payable within days of each advance 
lending limits subject to accounts receivable and inventory limitations  and an unused commitment fee equal to one quarter of one percent per annum on the difference between the maximum loan limit and average monthly borrowings 
collateral including all of the company s equipment  intangibles  inventories  and accounts receivable 
provides that the company may not pay dividends on its common stock in excess of per share on an annual basis 
the facility includes a prepayment penalty equal to one half of one percent of the original maximum loan limit million if the company prepays the entire facility or terminates the credit agreement on or before june  the facility includes a financial covenant which requires the company to maintain a minimum debt service ratio of to as measured by the previous twelve month period then ended 
the company was in compliance with this covenant at september the amount available for use on the facility at any given time is subject to a number of factors including eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances that fluctuate day to day 
based on our collateral and loan limits as defined in the facility agreement  the company s availability was approximately million at september 
table of contents and the outstanding balance on the revolving portion of the facility was million 
the resulting credit limit on the facility at september  was million 
at september  the revolving portion of the company s facility balance bore interest based on various short term libor rate elections made by the company 
these libor interest rate elections had an average rate of at september during fiscal  our peak borrowings under the facility were million and our average borrowings and average availability were and million  respectively 
our availability to borrow under the facility generally decreases as inventory and accounts receivable levels go up because of the borrowing limitations that are placed on collateralized assets 
cross default and co terminus provisions the company s owned real estate in bismarck  nd  quincy  il  and rapid city  sd  and certain warehouse equipment in the rapid city  sd warehouse is financed through term loans with marshall and ilsley bank m i  which is also a participant lender on the company s revolving line of credit 
the m i loans contain cross default provisions which cause all loans with m i to be considered in default if any one of the loans where m i is a lender  including the revolving credit facility  is in default 
in addition  the m i loans contain co terminus provisions which require all loans with m i to be paid in full if any of the loans are paid in full prior to the end of their specified terms 
redemption of series c convertible preferred stock in february  the holder of the company s series c convertible preferred stock series c redeemed all  shares of the issuance 
the series c issuance had been outstanding since  paid a dividend of per annum  and was convertible into  shares of common stock 
the company paid the liquidation value  or million  plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to fully redeem all of the outstanding shares 
the redemption was funded by our credit facility and satisfied all of the company s obligations under the series c convertible preferred stock agreement 
dividend payments the company paid cash dividends of  or per common share  in fiscal  and  or per common share  in fiscal during fiscal  the company had series a  b  and c convertible preferred stock convertible preferred stock outstanding 
in february  the series c convertible preferred stock was fully redeemed at the election of the holder 
the company paid cash dividends related to the convertible preferred stock of  and  respectively  during fiscal and fiscal other the company has several capital leases for office and warehouse equipment 
at september  the outstanding balances on the capital leases totaled approximately million 
the company has issued a letter of credit for million to its workers compensation insurance carrier as part of its self insured loss control program 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity risk the company s liquidity position is significantly influenced by its ability to maintain sufficient levels of working capital 
for our company and industry in general  customer credit risk and ongoing access to bank credit heavily influence liquidity positions 

table of contents the company s credit facility with bank of america expires in june we believe the company continues to have a strong working relationship with that financial institution and has maintained compliance with all related debt covenants 
the company also aggressively monitors its customer credit risk to limit exposure in that area 
the company does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk or fuel costs 
accordingly  significant price movements in these areas can and do impact the company s profitability 
the company believes its liquidity position going forward will be adequate to sustain operations 
however  a precipitous change in market conditions or a further deterioration in economic conditions could materially impact the company s future revenue stream as well as its ability to collect on customer accounts receivable balances and to secure bank credit 
other matters critical accounting estimates general the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates are set forth below and have not changed during fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts nature of estimates required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
we monitor our credit exposure on a daily basis and regularly assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
because credit losses can vary significantly over time  estimating the required allowance requires a number of assumptions that are uncertain 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required allowance for doubtful accounts using the following key assumptions 
historical collections represented as the amount of historical uncollectible accounts as a percent of total accounts receivable 
specific credit exposure on certain accounts identified based on management s review of the accounts receivable portfolio and taking into account the financial wherewithal of particular customers that management deems to have a higher risk of collection 
market conditions we consider a broad range of industry trends and macro economic issues which may impact the creditworthiness of our customers 
inventories nature of estimates required 
in our businesses  we carry large quantities and dollar amounts of inventory 
inventories primarily consist of finished products purchased in bulk quantities to be sold to our customers 
given the large quantities and broad range of products we carry  there is a risk that inventory may become impaired because it has become unsaleable or unrefundable  slow moving  obsolete  or because it has been discontinued 
the use of estimates is required in determining the salvage value of this inventory 

table of contents assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our inventory obsolescence reserve at each balance sheet date based on the following criteria slow moving products items identified as slow moving are evaluated on a case by case basis for impairment 
obsolete discontinued inventory products identified that are near or beyond their expiration dates 
we may also discontinue carrying certain product lines for our customers 
as a result  we estimate the market value of this inventory as if it were to be liquidated 
estimated salvage value sales price the salvage value of the inventory is estimated using management s evaluation of the congestion in the distribution channels and experience with brokers and inventory liquidators to determine the salvage value of the inventory 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets and intangible assets that were acquired in business combinations 
fixed assets and amortizable identified intangible assets are assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
goodwill is not amortized 
impairment of segment reporting units is measured in the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
the reporting units are valued using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
the company recorded no impairment charges in either fiscal or fiscal nature of estimates required 
management has to estimate the useful lives of the company s long lived assets 
in regard to the company s impairment analysis  the most significant assumptions include management s estimate of the annual growth rate used to project future sales and expenses 
assumptions and approach used 
for fixed assets  depreciable lives are based on our accounting policy which is intended to mirror the expected useful life of the asset 
in determining the estimated useful life of amortizable intangible assets  such as customer lists  we rely on our historical experience to estimate the useful life of the applicable asset and consider industry norms as a benchmark 
in evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets  we primarily use an income based approach discounted cash flow method in addition to both public and private company information 
a discounted cash flow methodology requires estimation in i forecasting future earnings ii determining the discount rate applicable to the earnings stream being discounted  and iii computing a terminal value at some point in the future 
the forecast of future earnings is an estimate of future financial performance based on current year results and management s evaluation of the market potential for growth 
the discount rate is a weighted average cost of capital using a targeted debt to equity ratio using the industry average under the assumption that it represents our optimal capital structure and can be achieved in a reasonable time period 
the terminal value is determined using a commonly accepted growth model 
insurance the company s insurance for workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits are provided through high deductible or self insured programs 
as a result  the company accrues for its workers compensation liability based upon claim reserves established with the assistance of a third party administrator  which are then trended and developed 
the reserves are evaluated at the end of each reporting period 
due to the uncertainty involved with the realization of claims incurred but unreported  management is required to make estimates of these claims 
assumptions and approach used 
in order to estimate our reserve for incurred but unreported claims we consider the following key factors employee health insurance claims historical claims experience we review loss runs for each month to calculate the average monthly claims experience 
lag period for reporting claims based on analysis and consultation with our third party administrator  our experience is such that we have a minimum of a one month lag period in which claims are reported 

table of contents workers compensation insurance claims historical claims experience we review prior years loss runs to estimate the average annual expected claims and review monthly loss runs to compare our estimates to actual claims 
lag period for reporting claims we utilize the assistance of our insurance agent to trend and develop reserves on reported claims in order to estimate the amount of incurred but unreported claims 
our insurance agent uses standard insurance industry loss development models 
income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on a periodic basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a related valuation allowance as appropriate 
in performing our evaluation  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
assumptions and approach used 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
in making that estimate we consider the following key factors our current financial position  historical financial information  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in our wholesale segment when products are delivered to customers which generally is the same day products are shipped and in our retail health food segment when products are sold to consumers 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts  and sales incentives to customers 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate and reserve for anticipated sales discounts 
we also estimate and provide a reserve for anticipated sales incentives to customers when earned under established program requirements 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the sales reserves using the following criteria sales discounts we use historical experience to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected due to customers taking advantage of authorized term discounts 
volume sales incentives we use historical experience in combination with quarterly reviews of customers sales progress in order to estimate the amount of volume incentives due to the customers on a periodic basis 

table of contents our estimates and assumptions for each of the aforementioned critical accounting estimates have not changed materially during the periods presented  nor are we aware of any reasons that they would be reasonably likely to change in the future
