b financial information about business segments we manage our business in four segments north american dispute and investigative services  north american business consulting services  international consulting operations  and economic consulting services 
the economic consulting services segment was added in in connection with our acquisition of the chicago partners business on may  see acquisitions 
these segments are generally defined by the nature of their services and geography 
the business is managed and resources are allocated on the basis of the four operating segments 
the north american dispute and investigative services segment provides a wide range of services to clients facing the challenges of disputes  litigation  forensic investigation  discovery  and regulatory compliance 
the clients of this segment are principally law firms  corporate general counsel  and corporate boards

certain unallocated expense amounts  related to specific reporting segments  have been excluded from the segment operating profit to be consistent with the information used by management to evaluate segment performance 
c narrative description of business overview we market our services directly to corporate counsel  law firms  government entities  corporate boards  corporate executives and special committees 
we use a variety of business development and marketing channels to communicate directly with current and prospective clients  including on site presentations  industry seminars  and industry specific articles 
new engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid level consultants working together with our business development team that supports all segments 
our future performance will continue to depend upon the ability of our consultants to win new engagements as well as our ability to retain such consultants 
a significant portion of new business arises from prior client engagements 
in addition  we seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross sell existing services provided by the other segments 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary activities 
in addition  an on site presence affords our consultants the opportunity to become aware of  and to help define  additional project opportunities as they are identified 
we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
such incremental revenues may cause variations in quarterly revenues and operating results if all other revenues and expenses during the quarters remain the same 
our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses  and the direct costs of recruiting and training the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes payroll costs  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel  which are used to indirectly support client projects 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
service offerings we provide wide and varied service offerings to our broad client base 
we consider the following to be our key professional services dispute  investigative  financial  operational and business advisory services  risk management and regulatory advisory services  strategy  economic analysis and transaction advisory solutions 
industry sectors we provide services to and focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change 
our service offerings are relevant to most industries and to the public sector 
however  we have significant industry specific knowledge and a large client base in the construction  energy  financial services  insurance and healthcare industries 
additionally  we have a strong client presence in the public sector  including united states and foreign governmental agencies 
we have a long history of work for companies  insurers and reinsurers in product liability matters 
human capital as of december   we had  employees 
at december   we had  full time equivalent fte employees  which are total employees adjusted for part time status  comprised of  consultants  project employees and administrative employees 
revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our consultants  therefore  success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative and experienced professionals at all levels 
in connection with recruiting  we employ internal recruiters  retain executive search firms  and utilize personal and business contacts to recruit professionals with significant subject matter expertise and or consulting experience 
consultants are drawn from the industries we serve  from accounting and other consulting organizations  and from top rated colleges and universities 
we try to retain our consultants by offering competitive packages of base and incentive compensation  equity ownership  and benefits as well as challenging careers 
independent contractors supplement our consultants on certain engagements 
we find that hiring independent contractors on a per engagement basis from time to time allows us to adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services 
in addition to the employees and independent contractors discussed above  we have acquired and seek to acquire consulting businesses to add highly skilled professionals  to enhance our service offerings and to expand our geographical footprint 
we believe that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and consulting capabilities strengthens our platform  market share and overall operating results 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond termination 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects 
we continually review and adjust  if needed  our consultants total compensation to include salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  and other cash and equity incentives to ensure that it is competitive within the industry  is consistent with our performance  and provides us with the ability to achieve target profitability levels 
our compensation structure is reviewed and approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
our bill rates to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and levels of the consulting staff 
we monitor and adjust those bill rates according to the supply and demand of the then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 
competition the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national  and international firms 
many of these companies are global in scope and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
however  we believe that our independence  experience  reputation  industry focus  and broad range of professional services enable us to compete effectively in the consulting marketplace 
d other matters concentration of revenues revenues earned from our top clients amounted to percent  percent and percent of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues earned from our top clients amounted to percent  percent and percent of total revenues for the years ended december   and there were no clients that accounted for more than percent of our total revenues for the years ended december   and the mix of our largest clients may change from year to year 
non us operations we have offices in canada  asia  and the united kingdom 
in addition  we have clients based in the united states that have international operations 
the united kingdom accounted for percent and percent of our revenue during the years ended december  and no country  other than the united states and the united kingdom  accounted for more than percent of our total annual revenues in any of the three years ended december   and our non us subsidiaries  in the aggregate  represented approximately percent  or million  of our total revenues in compared to percent  or million  in and percent  or million in new york stock exchange disclosures the members of our board of directors are thomas a

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
such factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the marketplace caused by economic and political conditions 
global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activity engaged in by our clients and the industries we serve 
clients could determine that discretionary projects are no longer viable or that new projects are not advisable 
this may reduce demand for our services  depress pricing for our services or render certain services obsolete  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in global economic conditions or the regulatory or legislative landscape could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 
although we have implemented cost management measures  if we are unable to appropriately manage costs or if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be negatively affected 
in addition  any significant volatility or sustained decline in the market price of our common stock could impair our ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
recent turmoil in the credit markets and the financial services industry may impact our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and may negatively impact our cash flow 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on us 
these events could also adversely impact the availability of financing to our clients and therefore adversely impact our ability to collect amounts due from such clients or cause them to terminate their contracts with us completely 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to consummate future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs or repay amounts owed under our long term credit arrangements 
we maintain a million unsecured credit facility including a term loan agreement and a revolving line of credit agreement to assist in funding short term and long term cash requirements that expires in this agreement contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  certain levels of interest and debt coverage 
poor performance could cause us to be in default of these covenants 
while we are in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as of december   there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance in the future 
in addition  the current credit facility may not be sufficient to meet the future needs of our business if a decline in financial performance occurs  nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to effect future acquisitions or to otherwise meet our working capital needs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance our current credit facility as it comes due or refinance our current credit facility at comparable terms 
furthermore  financial institutions that are lenders under our credit facility may be adversely impacted by the economy and unable to meet their obligations under our credit facility 
further  if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to us  we and our financial results would be adversely impacted  which could result in all of the effects described above 
regulatory and legislative changes affecting us  our clients  competitors or staff could have an impact on our business 
many of our clients are in highly regulated industries such as the healthcare  energy  financial institutions and insurance industries 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries could impact the market for our service offerings  including potentially rendering certain of our service offerings obsolete 
in addition  regulatory and legislative changes could impact the competition for consulting services 
this change could either increase or decrease our position compared with our competitors 
our inability to retain and  as necessary  strengthen our executive management team would be detrimental to the success of our business 
we rely heavily on a small group of senior executives and retaining their services is important to our future success 
as we continue to grow the business  the executive management team will face increasing challenges and the possible need to supplement or expand the existing team to enable us to put in place a necessary succession plan 
any failures in this regard could impact  among other factors  our revenues  growth and profitability 
our inability to hire and retain highly skilled consulting professionals could have a material adverse effect on our success 
we rely heavily on our consulting staff and management team 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to hire  retain  develop and motivate highly skilled professionals 
competition for these skilled professionals is intense and our inability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of consultants and managers could have a serious effect on our ability to meet client needs 
the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a serious negative effect 
further  usage restrictions on our equity and any significant volatility or sustained decline in the market price of our common stock could impair our ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
compensation and retention related issues are a continuing challenge 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain current pricing and utilization rates 
our revenue  and thereby our profitability  is largely based on the bill rates charged to clients and the number of hours our professionals work on client engagements  which we define as the utilization of our professionals 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the pricing for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our professionals  revenues  project profit margins and our profitability will suffer 
bill rates and utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to predict future demand for services and maintain the appropriate staffing without significant underutilized personnel  our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  our competitors pricing of services  the market demand for our services  our ability to manage our human capital resources  our ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our growth strategies  and the economic  political and regulatory environment as noted above 
our client engagements are generally short term in nature  less than one year  and may be terminated 
our inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on us 
we might not meet our current or future commitments if we do not continually secure new engagements 
many of the client engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation is settled  our engagement for those services usually is no longer necessary and is promptly terminated 
some of our work involves multiple engagements or stages 
in those engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
our engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to our office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
additionally  the above mentioned factors limit our ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing  which can impact our financial results 
our client engagements and revenues are frequently event driven and therefore difficult to forecast 
in the past  we have derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of  the sub prime mortgage crisis and significant natural disasters including major hurricanes 
those events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for the challenges they face 
these factors limit our ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing  which can impact our financial results 
unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to our professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our professional reputation and that of our consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our engagements are subject to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that our services were deficient or that we breached any of our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities  could distract our management and could damage our reputation 
we carry professional liability insurance  but our insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from our engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims  and the costs of defense 
some of the work that we do involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
we do work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to higher risk engagements and higher risk clients  these efforts may be ineffective and a professional error or omission in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
examples of higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  usually in hospitals and other healthcare providers  corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  engagements where we deliver a fairness opinion  engagements where we deliver a compliance effectiveness opinion  engagements where we deliver an actuarial opinion with respect to insurance company loss reserves  and engagements involving independent consultants reports in support of financings 
as we become larger  we increasingly encounter professional conflicts of interest 
as we become larger  the potential for conflicts of interest also increases 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  including a conflict of interest  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations  as well as our ability to retain these consultants 
in addition  although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts prior to accepting each new engagement  those systems are not fool proof and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and professional liability which may adversely impact our financial results 
our international operations create special risks 
we have physical offices outside the united states in the united kingdom  canada and china and conduct business in several other countries 
we expect to continue our international expansion  and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial  business and legal risks  including cultural and language differences  employment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  burdensome regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  managing the risks associated with engagements with foreign officials and governmental agencies  including the risks arising from the foreign corrupt practices act  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses 
if we are not able to quickly adapt to our new markets  our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process 
we work for various united states and foreign entities and agencies 
these projects have risks that include  but are not limited to  the following government entities reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts 
if the government finds that the costs are not reimbursable  then we will not be allowed to bill for them  or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to us 
findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work and affect future margins 
if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of whether it is accurate  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our relationship with the particular government agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we have invested in specialized systems  processes and intellectual capital for which we may fail to recover our investment or which may become obsolete 
we have developed specialized systems and processes that provide a competitive advantage in serving current clients and obtaining new clients 
additionally  many of our service offerings rely on technology or intellectual capital that is subject to rapid change 
our intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 
our information technology systems will require improvements as our business grows 
the increased scale and complexity of our businesses may require additional management systems that we may not be able to implement in a timely manner 
the challenges of achieving and managing sustained growth may cause strain on our management team  management processes and information technology systems 
if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  this may impair our financial results  competitive position and ability to retain our professionals 
we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls 
if we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting or fail to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use  we may fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis  or be unable to adequately report on our business and the results of operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
nevertheless  even with adequate controls  we may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud 
also  controls that are currently adequate may in the future become inadequate because of changes in conditions 
the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
acquired businesses may not achieve expected results which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have developed our business  in part  through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
the substantial majority of the purchase price we pay for acquired businesses is related to intangible assets 
we may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless we are able to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire 
we face multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel  including differences in corporate cultures and management styles  retention of personnel  conflict issues with clients  and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to our current businesses 
any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could cause the acquired businesses to fail to achieve expected results  which would in turn  adversely affect our financial performance  including possible impairment of the acquired assets 
additionally  the financing of acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could also impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have historically acquired a significant number of companies  goodwill and other intangible assets have represented a material portion of our assets 
we are required to perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
we also are required to review long lived assets  including identified intangible assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of one of our businesses  and other factors 
if the fair market value of one of our businesses is less than its carrying amount  we could be required to record an impairment charge 
the valuation of the businesses requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of our businesses  including such factors as market performance  changes in our client base and operating cash flows 
the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
we are subject to unpredictable risks of litigation 
although we seek to avoid litigation whenever possible  from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
disputes may arise  for example  from client engagements  employment issues  regulatory actions  corporate acquisitions  real estate and other business transactions 
the costs and outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and may be worse than we can foresee 
this could have a material adverse effect on us

item properties 
we have approximately operating leases for office facilities  principally in the united states 
due to acquisitions and growth  we often times have more than one operating lease in the cities in which we have offices 
additional space may be required as our business expands geographically  but we believe we will be able to obtain suitable space as needed 
following are our principal regional office locations united states outside of the united states atlanta  georgia asia hong kong chicago  illinois canada toronto los angeles  california united kingdom london new york  new york san francisco  california washington dc item legal proceedings 
from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of those lawsuits or claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

overview we are an independent specialty consulting firm combining deep industry expertise and integrated solutions to assist companies and their legal counsel in addressing the challenges of uncertainty and risk  and leveraging opportunities for overall business model improvement 
professional services include dispute  investigative  financial  operational and business advisory  risk management and regulatory advisory  strategy  economic analysis and transaction advisory solutions 
we provide our services to government agencies  legal counsel and large companies facing the challenges of uncertainty  risk  distress and significant change 
we focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change and on the issues driving these transformations 
our revenues  margins and profits will likely be impacted by a significant decline in the united states or world economy 
examples of other impacting events that may affect us are natural disasters  legislative and regulatory changes  capital market disruptions  reductions in discretionary consulting spending  crises in the energy  healthcare  financial services  insurance and other industries  and significant client specific events 
we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
such incremental revenues may cause variations in quarterly revenues and operating results if all other revenues and expenses during the quarters remain the same 
our most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses  and the direct costs of recruiting and training the consulting staff 
consultant compensation consists of salaries  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes payroll costs  incentive compensation  stock compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel  which are used to indirectly support client projects 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues as the related professional services are provided 
in connection with recording revenues  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenues to cash 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and are required to assess whether one or more units of accounting are present 
usually we account for the fees as one unit of accounting as we do not have fair value evidence for individual tasks or milestones 
there are also client engagements where we are paid a fixed amount for our services 
the recording of these fixed revenue amounts requires us to make an estimate of the total amount of work to be performed and revenues are then recognized as efforts are expended based on i objectively determinable output measures  ii input measures if output measures are not reliable  or iii the straight line method over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we also earn incremental revenues 
these incremental revenue amounts are generally contingent on a specific event and the incremental revenues are recognized when the contingencies are resolved 
any taxes assessed on revenues relating to services provided to our clients are recorded on a net basis 
accounts receivable realization we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by us of amounts due from our clients 
if our clients financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair value of the net assets acquired  which is accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
we test goodwill annually for impairment 
we also review long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment testing and reviews may be impacted by  among other things  our expected operating performance  market valuation of comparable companies  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
considerable management judgment is required to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization during the periods presented 
intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles other than goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill include customer lists and relationships  employee non compete agreements  employee training methodology and materials  backlog revenue and trade names 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized based on the period of consumption  ranging up to nine years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment test is performed using a two step  fair value based test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value determined in step one 
the impairment test is considered for each reporting unit as defined in sfas which equates to our reporting segments 
we perform our annual test in the second quarter of each year 
as discussed  in accordance with sfas  we determined the fair value of each reporting unit 
this test required us to estimate future cash flows and termination value 
the fair value estimate also depended on interest rate  debt  and working capital requirements 
estimates can also be impacted by  among other things  expected performance  market valuation of comparable companies  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
based on these results we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill and  as such  did not complete step two of the impairment test 
during our annual test of goodwill  we considered that each of the four reporting units has significant goodwill and intangible assets 
the estimated fair value of the north american business consulting reporting unit and the north american disputes and investigations reporting unit were significantly in excess of their net asset carrying value by approximately and  respectively 
the estimated fair value of the international consulting operations reporting unit exceeded its net asset carrying value by approximately 
given the international consulting operations segment s lower size and higher expected growth rates  this excess may be more volatile 
the economic consulting services reporting unit was acquired concurrent with the annual test and thus its estimated value approximated the carrying value of its net assets 
we subsequently considered in each of the remaining two quarters of whether or not the fair value of each of the reporting units could have fallen below its carrying value 
we considered the elements outlined in sfas and other factors including  but not limited to  changes in the business climate in which we operate  recent disruptions in the financial markets  our market capitalization in excess of our book value  our recent operating performance  the operating performance of the economic consulting services reporting unit relative to our expectations at the time of acquisition  and our annual budget for as a result of this review we determined that no such event or condition existed that would cause us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test prior to our next annual test date 
however  we continue to monitor these factors and we may be required to perform an additional impairment test in future periods if our operating performance or the overall economic conditions continue to deteriorate 
our intangible assets are subject to changes in estimated fair market values which are determined in part based on our operating performance and expectations for the future 
our test for goodwill impairment is based on the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is subject to  among other things  changes in our estimated business future growth rate  profit margin  long term outlook and weighted average cost of capital 
our international consulting operations and economic consulting services segments are most sensitive to those changes as the excess of their fair value over their asset carrying value is generally lower 
additionally  our long term assets are subject to changes in events or circumstances that could impact their carrying value 
a decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units or other long term assets could result in an impairment charge 
share based payments we recognize the cost resulting from all share based compensation arrangements  such as our stock option and restricted stock plans  in the financial statements based on their fair value 
management judgment is required in order to i estimate the fair value of certain share based payments  ii determine expected attribution period and iii assess expected future forfeitures 
we treat our employee stock purchase plan as compensatory and record the purchase discount from market price of stock purchases by employees as share based compensation expense 
income taxes we account for deferred income taxes utilizing an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
when appropriate  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our effective tax rate 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing the financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosures 
the application of fin requires management judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate 
other operating costs we recorded expense and related liabilities associated with office closings and excess space reductions related to a plan to reduce office space as other operating costs 
the expense consisted of rent obligations for the offices  net of expected sublease income  and the write down and accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements reflecting the change in the estimated useful life of our abandoned offices 
the expected sublease income is subject to market conditions and may be adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the office closure obligations have been discounted to net present value 
the determination of the expense and related liabilities requires management judgment and could impact our future financial results

most revenues before reimbursements are earned from consultants fee revenues that are primarily a function of billable hours  bill rates and consultant headcount 
for the year ended december  revenues before reimbursements increased percent over the increase was due to a combination of recent acquisitions  increased bill rates and utilization  which was partially offset by the negative impact of a strengthened us dollar on the revenues of our uk and canadian operations 
assuming recent acquisitions operated at historic run rates  substantially all of the year over year revenue increase would have been attributable to such acquisitions 
headcount decreased in from the prior year  reflecting realignment initiatives in the segments which were partially offset by increased headcount from acquisitions 
overall  the consultant utilization rates were percent for compared to percent for  primarily reflecting the impact of the lower headcount associated with the realignment initiatives in the segments near the end of and the addition of economic consulting services segment in the increase in bill rate of percent in over was mainly due to an overall larger mix of revenues from higher bill rate services and efforts to increase general billing rates

the bill rate increase in over was due to rate increases and a higher mix of senior level consultants 
this segment was further impacted by recent disruptions in the financial markets  including decreased demand for our consulting services in the financial and insurance markets  as clients in these markets had limited discretionary consulting spending 
acquisitions in the segment did not have a significant impact on growth for compared to  given that the bard acquisition was completed at the end of and the full year impact of the amdc acquisition was not material

the acquisitions during this period were precept in march  abros in january  augmentis in june  and troika in july these acquisitions added approximately employees to our headcount over two years and accounted for approximately two thirds and one half of international consulting operations growth in over and over  respectively 
the remaining revenue growth was associated with increased headcount and bill rates

cost of services before reimbursable expenses includes amounts related to consultant incentive compensation 
incentive compensation is structured to reward consultants based on the achieved business performance and under a compensation methodology approved by our management and the compensation committee of our board of directors 
the consultant incentive compensation was higher in over mainly due to improved operating performance and increased wages due to a higher mix of senior level consultants in in addition  we entered into long term incentive and retention agreements during the second and third quarters of see the discussion of unsecured forgivable loans in note to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  the amortization of which is included in consultant compensation 
the increase in compensation expense related to the issuance of these long term and retention agreements were partially offset by reduced share based compensation expense

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include facility related costs  salaries and benefits costs of management and support personnel  bad debt costs for uncollectible billed amounts  professional and administrative services costs  and all other support costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  to million during the year ended december   and million  or percent  to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of an increase in allowances for doubtful accounts receivable of million in over we provide services to and have receivables due from many financial and insurance clients in all four of our segments 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable during was attributable to the impact of recent disruptions in the financial markets  including bankruptcies 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts over prior periods reflects management s view of the likelihood of collection of receivables due from certain of our financial industry clients  as well as the impact of the financial market disruptions on a broad range of clients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on historical experience and management judgment and may change based on market conditions or specific client circumstances 
excluding the impact of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  general and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  during compared to the remaining increase was attributable to incremental overhead costs related to professional fees including legal and information technology costs  which was partially offset by slightly lower administrative wage and benefit costs 
the increase in over was due to several factors including business acquisitions  as well as the support for additional consulting personnel 
increases in administrative headcount to support the additional consulting personnel contributed to an increase in total administrative payroll and benefit costs 
the balance of the increase was attributed to expansion of existing facilities  facilities acquired through business acquisitions and certain investments made to our infrastructure in the areas of technology  business development and marketing

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements excluding allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was  and percent for the years ended december   and other operating costs office consolidation 
during the year ended december  we recorded million of office closure related costs which consisted of adjustments to office closure obligations  the write down of leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements in offices to be abandoned 
during  as a result of an assessment of our real estate needs subsequent to the acquisition of chicago partners  we decided to reoccupy a portion of certain property in chicago  illinois that had previously been abandoned 
the impact of this change in estimate did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we began to eliminate duplicate facilities and consolidate and close certain offices 
we recorded million of expense associated with the office closings and excess space reductions completed during the expense consisted of rent obligations through march for the offices  net of expected sublease income  and approximately million write down of leasehold improvements reflecting their estimated fair value 
we continue to monitor our estimates for office closure obligations and related expected sublease income 
such estimates are subject to market conditions and may be adjusted in future periods as necessary 
of the million liability recorded at december   we expect to pay million in cash relating to these obligations during the next twelve months

operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  the number of business days in a quarter  employee hiring and utilization rates 
the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter due to various factors  such as the ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  attaining certain contractual objectives  the size and scope of assignments  and general economic conditions 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number of client assignments  or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
operating results are also impacted by the other operating costs 
in addition  interest expense and interest income fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of balance changes in cash and debt 
human capital resources our human capital resources include consulting professionals and administrative and management personnel 
as a result of both recruiting activities and business acquisitions  we have a diverse pool of consultants and administrative support staff with various skills and experience 
recent acquisitions have broadened our international presence 
the following tables shows the employee data for the periods presented number of fte consultants as of december  average number of fte consultants for the year average utilization of consultants  based on industry standard of  hours number of administrative and management personnel as of december  the average number of fte consultants is adjusted for part time status and takes into consideration hiring and attrition which occur during the year 
in addition to the headcounts presented above  we hired project employees on a short term basis or seasonal basis 
we believe the practice of hiring these employees provides greater flexibility in adjusting consulting and administrative personnel levels in response to changes in demand for our professional services 
the short term or seasonal hires have been employed to supplement services on certain engagements or to provide additional administrative support to the consultants 
in connection with certain recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond termination 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects 
we continually review and adjust  if needed  our consultants total compensation  which includes salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  and other cash and equity incentives from certain programs  to ensure that the consultants compensation is competitive within the industry  is consistent with our performance and provides us the ability to achieve target profitability levels

as of december   we had total bank debt outstanding of million under our credit agreement compared to million as of december  we calculate accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso by dividing the accounts receivable balance  net of deferred revenue credits  at the end of the quarter  by daily net revenues 
daily net revenues are calculated by taking quarterly net revenues divided by days  approximately equal to the number of days in a quarter 
calculated as such  we had dso of days at december  compared to days at december  the improvement was attributable to strong cash collections at the end of operating activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities during compared to decreased slightly due to a higher investment in working capital  partially offset by increased net income 
the increase is working capital was mainly associated with separation and severance payments made in  incentive loans see the discussion of unsecured forgivable loans in note to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which was partially offset by increased accounts receivable collections during the net cash provided by operating activities during compared to increased million 
the increase was related primarily to a lower investment in working capital  including increases in wages payable and accrued liabilities associated with separation and severance and real estate actions 
this increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was unfavorably impacted by lower net income associated with higher interest expense and other operating costs 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for compared to mainly relates to a decrease in acquisitions and lower investment in technology and leasehold improvements  which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property in the slight decrease in net cash used in investing activities for compared to was primarily a result of proceeds from our sale of property in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in during  we had net repayments of bank borrowings of million associated primarily with lower cash needs for investing activities

debt  commitments and capital on may   we amended and restated our bank borrowing credit agreement the credit agreement to increase our revolving line of credit capacity from million to million the revolving credit facility and to obtain a million unsecured term loan facility the term loan facility 
we have the option to increase the revolving credit facility up to million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are payable in may the credit agreement provides for borrowings in multiple currencies including us dollars  canadian dollars  uk pound sterling and euro 
at our option  borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility bear interest  in general  based at a variable rate equal to applicable base rate or london interbank offered rate libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
for libor loans  the applicable margin will vary depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of total funded debt to adjusted ebitda and whether the loan is made under the term loan facility or revolving credit facility 
as of december  the applicable margins on libor loans under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were and  respectively 
as of december   the applicable margins for base rate loans under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were and zero  respectively 
for libor loans  the applicable margin will vary between to depending upon our performance and financial condition 
for the years ended december  and  our average borrowing rate under the credit agreement including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement was and  respectively 
as of december  we had million available to borrow under our credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes certain financial covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of the sum of adjusted ebitda and rental expense to the sum of cash interest expense and rental expense not less than at december   under the definitions in the credit agreement  our consolidated leverage ratio was and our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was in addition to the financial covenants  the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and is subject to customary exceptions 
these covenants will limit our ability to incur liens or other encumbrances or make investments  incur indebtedness  enter into mergers  consolidations and asset sales  pay dividends or other distributions  change the nature of our business and engage in transactions with affiliates

as of december   we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
the following table shows the components of significant commitments as of december  and the scheduled years of payments due by period shown in thousands contractual obligations total to to thereafter deferred purchase price obligations software license agreements notes payable line of credit term loan lease commitments during  we began to eliminate duplicate facilities  consolidate and close certain offices 
of the million of lease commitments as of december   million of the lease commitments related to offices we have abandoned or reduced excess space within  which are available for sublease 
such sublease income  if any  would offset the cash outlays 
we adopted fin as of january  as of the date of the adoption  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits which  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
during and  we reduced our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to such unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million and million  respectively  due to the settlement of tax positions with various tax authorities or by virtue of the statute of limitations expiring for the years with uncertain positions 
as such  we had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits which  if recognized  would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
in the next twelve months  we expect to reduce the reserve for uncertain tax positions by approximately million due to settlement of tax positions with various tax authorities or by virtue of the statute of limitations expiring for years with uncertain tax positions 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  future cash flows from operations and our credit agreement will provide adequate cash to fund anticipated short term and long term cash needs from normal operations 
in the event we make significant cash expenditures in the future for major acquisitions or other non operating activities  we might need additional debt or equity financing  as appropriate 
additionally  our credit agreement is with a syndicate of several banks 
these banks could be negatively impacted by the recent disruptions in the financial markets 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risks relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
the interest rate risk is associated with our borrowings under the line of credit  and our investment portfolio  classified as cash equivalents 
our general investment policy is to limit the risk of principal loss by limiting market and credit risks 
the foreign currency risk is associated with our operations in foreign countries 
at december   our investments were primarily limited to a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates rise 
because of the short periods to maturity of these instruments  an increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank for a notional value of million through june  this agreement effectively fixed our libor base rate for million of our indebtedness at a rate of during this period 
we expect the interest rate derivative to be highly effective against changes in cash flows related to changes in interest rates and have recorded the derivative as a hedge 
as a result  gains or losses related to fluctuations in fair value of the interest rate derivative are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense as the variable interest expense on our indebtedness is recorded 
there was no ineffectiveness related to this hedge for the year ended december  as of december   we had a million liability related to this interest rate derivative and recorded a million unrealized loss  net of a tax benefit of million  to accumulated other comprehensive income during other than our previously disclosed contractual obligations of million and the million interest rate swap agreement  we did not have  at december   any other short term debt  long term debt  interest rate derivatives  forward exchange agreements  firmly committed foreign currency sales transactions  or derivative commodity instruments 
our market risk associated with the credit agreement relates to changes in interest rates 
as of december   borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  in general  based at a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate equal to the higher of a reference prime rate or one half of one percent above the federal funds rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
based on borrowings under the credit agreement at december   each quarter point change in market interest rates would result in approximately a million change in annual interest expense  after considering the impact of our interest rate swap agreement 
we operate in foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had net assets of approximately million with a functional currency of the uk pounds sterling and million with a functional currency of the canadian dollar related to our operations in the united kingdom and canada  respectively 
at december   we had net assets denominated in the non functional currency of approximately million 
as such  a ten percent change in the value of the local currency would result in a million currency gain or loss in our results of operations
