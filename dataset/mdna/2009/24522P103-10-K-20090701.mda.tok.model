executive overview our fiscal results reflect increased net sales that  together with productivity savings  more than offset the impact of continuing inflationary cost pressures and increased marketing expenses 
in fiscal  we achieved net sales of  million  operating income of million and net income of million  compared to net sales of  million  operating income of million and net income of million in fiscal we sold our starkist seafood business in fiscal and used million of the proceeds to repay term loans 

table of contents our consumer products segment continues to be healthy despite the current macroeconomic environment 
our vegetable and tomato categories benefitted from consumers preparing and eating more meals at home 
however  consumers continue to migrate toward value oriented products 
in our pet products segment  consumers are focusing on buying larger package sizes 
pet trends indicate that people are continuing to purchase snacks to treat their pets despite the tough economic times 
overall  our fiscal sales were positively impacted by solid growth in both our consumer products and pet products operating segments  driven by pricing  volume growth in pet products and increased sales of new products  partially offset by price elasticity the volume decline associated with price increases 
our operating results continued to be pressured by higher ingredient  commodity and raw product costs as compared to the prior year 
in particular  in our pet products segment  the price of grains  fats and oils has increased related to higher overall energy costs  competition for land and the demand for alternative fuels  among other factors 
our fiscal results were also impacted by a nearly increase in marketing expenses in accordance with our accelerated growth plan 
see accelerated growth plan below for a description of our accelerated growth plan 
there were no transformation related expenses during fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal economic factors during fiscal  we experienced higher ingredient  commodity and raw product costs  as well as higher tinplate and other packaging costs  and higher manufacturing costs 
we implemented price increases across both our consumer products and pet products operating segments which  together with productivity savings  more than offset these cost increases 
in fiscal  we believe that we will experience cost increases of a lesser magnitude than we experienced in fiscal fiscal cost increases are expected to be driven primarily by increased tinplate and other packaging costs 
accelerated growth plan our mission is to fortify del monte s position as a leading branded marketer of quality food products in the us retail market and become a top tier consumer packaged food company 
we have taken steps over the last several years to upgrade our portfolio and increase our competitiveness 
we completed the divestiture of the soup and infant feeding businesses and the acquisitions of meow mix and milk bone to support the upgrade of our portfolio 
the implementation and completion of our transformation plan announced in june contributed to increasing our competitiveness 
this transformation plan was completed in fiscal in july  we announced our accelerated growth plan 
each of the strategic initiatives of the accelerated growth plan is described below 
execute pricing and productivity to address cost pressures we will use pricing actions and productivity savings to neutralize cost inflation 
our pricing actions have been taken to mitigate our higher costs  and together with our productivity initiatives  are addressing some of the inflationary cost increases we have seen over the last few years 
in fiscal  our pricing and productivity actions more than offset continued operational cost increases 
in fiscal  we expect productivity savings to largely offset operational cost increases 
we also expect to benefit from the impact of fiscal price increases 
unleash potential of core brands we will focus on growing our higher margin core business by increasing investment in the associated brands 
we will increase marketing spending and drive innovation of these core brands beyond business as usual 
in fiscal  we launched a new million national advertising campaign for our pup peroni brand dog snacks and announced a 
table of contents spokesdog for our milk bone year anniversary 
the launch of our del monte fruit chillers tubes in fiscal is an example of innovation behind our core del monte brand 
in fiscal  we will continue to focus on increased marketing support and innovation 
drive accelerated growth with key growth engines we will drive our key growth engines  including packaged produce  with category building innovation and marketing 
these growth engines leverage our brands to fill unmet consumer needs where there are growth opportunities 
for example  in fiscal  we launched del monte citrus bowls and del monte super fruit and supported these efforts with increased marketing spending 
in fiscal  we expect additional product launches and further increases in marketing spending 
to ensure successful execution of these multi year strategic initiatives  we took three supporting actions in fiscal we completed the divestiture of our starkist seafood business in october in addition  we centralized our marketing function in san francisco under the leadership of a new chief marketing officer 
finally  we increased our marketing spending behind our brands by nearly over the prior year 
in fiscal  we expect another approximately increase in marketing spending 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to trade promotions  retirement benefits  goodwill and intangibles  and retained insurance liabilities 
estimates in the assumptions used in the valuation of our stock option expense are updated periodically and reflect conditions that existed at the time of each new issuance of stock options 
we base estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and  therefore  these estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our significant accounting policies are described in note significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements trade promotions trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of our products  and are critical to the support of our business 
trade promotion costs include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of our products to consumers  to advertise our products in their circulars  to obtain favorable display positions in their stores  and to obtain shelf space 
we accrue for trade promotions  primarily at the time products are sold to customers  by reducing sales and recording a corresponding accrued liability 
the amount we accrue is based on an estimate of the level of performance of the trade promotion  which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar promotions  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  and sales and payment trends with similar previously offered programs 
our original 
table of contents estimated costs of trade promotions are reasonably likely to change in the future as a result of changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
we perform monthly evaluations of our outstanding trade promotions  making adjustments  where appropriate  to reflect changes in our estimates 
the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by our customers for amounts they consider due to them 
final determination of the permissible trade promotion amounts due to a customer generally may take up to months from the product shipment date 
our evaluations during fiscal and fiscal resulted in net reductions to the trade promotion liability and increases in net sales from continuing operations of million and million  respectively  which related to prior year activity 
these adjustments represented less than of our trade promotion expense in both fiscal and fiscal retirement benefits we sponsor non contributory defined benefit pension plans db plans  defined contribution plans  multi employer plans and certain other unfunded retirement benefit plans for our eligible employees 
the amount of db plans benefits eligible retirees receive is based on their earnings and age 
retirees may also be eligible for medical  dental and life insurance benefits other benefits if they meet certain age and service requirements at retirement 
generally  other benefit costs are subject to plan maximums  such that the company and retiree both share in the cost of these benefits 
our assumptions 
we utilize independent third party actuaries to assist us in calculating the expense and liabilities related to the db plans benefits and other benefits 
db plans benefits or other benefits which are expected to be paid are expensed over the employees expected service period 
the actuaries measure our annual db plans benefits and other benefits expense by relying on certain assumptions made by us 
such assumptions include the discount rate used to determine projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost db plans benefits and other benefits  the expected long term rate of return on assets db plans benefits  the rate of increase in compensation levels db plans benefits  and other factors including employee turnover  retirement age  mortality and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future expectations 
the assumptions  the plan assets and the plan obligations are used to measure our annual db plans benefits expense and other benefits expense 
since the db plans benefits and other benefits liabilities are measured on a discounted basis  the discount rate is a significant assumption 
the discount rate was determined based on an analysis of interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt at each measurement date 
in order to appropriately match the bond maturities with expected future cash payments  we utilize differing bond portfolios to estimate the discount rates for the db plans and for the other benefits 
the discount rate used to determine db plans and other benefits projected benefit obligation as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect at the measurement date 
the same rate is also used to determine db plans and other benefits expense for the following fiscal year 
the long term rate of return for db plans assets is based on our historical experience  our db plans investment guidelines and our expectations for long term rates of return 
our db plans investment guidelines are 
table of contents established based upon an evaluation of market conditions  tolerance for risk  and cash requirements for benefit payments 
the following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to determine our projected benefit obligations for our qualified db plans and other benefits may  april  pension benefits discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation rate of increase in compensation levels other benefits discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation the following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to determine our periodic benefit cost for our qualified db plans and other benefits fiscal year pension benefits discount rate used to determine periodic benefit cost rate of increase in compensation levels long term rate of return on assets other benefits discount rate used to determine periodic benefit cost for measurement purposes  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the preferred provider organization plan and associated indemnity plans for fiscal and fiscal the rate of increase is assumed to decline gradually to 
for the health maintenance organization plans  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for both fiscal and fiscal the rate of increase is assumed to decline gradually to 
a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the dental and vision plans for fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents sensitivity of assumptions 
if we assumed a basis point change in the following assumptions  our fiscal projected benefit obligation and expense would increase decrease by the following amounts in millions basis points basis points pension benefits discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation discount rate used in determining net pension expense long term rate of return on assets used in determining net pension expense other benefits discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation an increase in the assumed health care cost trend of basis points in each year would increase the postretirement benefit obligation for the fiscal year end by million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the period then ended by million 
a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend of basis points would decrease the postretirement benefit obligation for the fiscal year end by million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the period then ended by million 
future expense 
our fiscal pension expense for our qualified db plans is currently estimated to be approximately million and other benefits expense is estimated to be approximately million 
these estimates incorporate our assumptions 
our actual future pension and other benefit expense amounts may vary depending upon the accuracy of our original assumptions and future assumptions 
goodwill and intangibles del monte produces  distributes and markets products under many different brand names 
although each of our brand names has value  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  only those that have been purchased have a carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet 
during an acquisition  the purchase price is allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including brand names and other intangibles  based on estimated fair value  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we have evaluated our capitalized brand names and determined that some have lives that generally range from to years amortizing brands and others have indefinite lives non amortizing brands 
non amortizing brands typically have significant market share and a history of strong earnings and cash flow  which we expect to continue into the foreseeable future 
amortizing brands are amortized over their estimated lives 
we review the asset groups containing amortizing brands including related tangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if an asset or asset 
table of contents group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
non amortizing brands and goodwill are not amortized  but are instead tested for impairment at least annually 
non amortizing brands are considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
goodwill is considered impaired if the book value of the reporting unit containing the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
if estimated fair value is less than the book value  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
the estimated fair value of our non amortizing brands is determined using the relief from royalty method  which is based upon the estimated rent or royalty we would pay for the use of a brand name if we did not own it 
for goodwill  the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using the income approach  which is based on the cash flows that the unit is expected to generate over its remaining life  and the market approach  which is based on market multiples of similar businesses 
for the fiscal impairment test  both the income approach and the market approach were weighted in our calculation of estimated fair value of our reporting units 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments consumer products and pet products reflecting the way that we manage our business 
annually  we engage third party valuation experts to assist in this process 
considerable management judgment is necessary in estimating future cash flows  market interest rates  discount rates and other factors affecting the valuation of goodwill and intangibles  including the operating and macroeconomic factors that may affect them 
we use historical financial information  internal plans and projections  and industry information in making such estimates 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for our non amortizing brands or goodwill during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal during fiscal  as a result of a decision to discontinue five non core pet brands  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to amortizing brands 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for our amortizing brands during fiscal and at may   we had  million of goodwill   million of non amortizing brands  million of amortizing brands  net of amortization and million of customer relationships  net of amortization 
the pet products segment has of the goodwill and of the non amortizing brands 
the del monte brand itself  which is included in the consumer products segment  comprises of non amortizing brands 
while we currently believe the fair value of all of our intangible assets exceeds carrying value  materially different assumptions regarding future performance and discount rates could result in future impairment losses 
stock option expense we believe an effective way to align the interests of certain employees with those of our stockholders is through employee stock based incentives 
we typically issue two types of employee stock based incentives stock options and restricted stock incentives restricted shares 
stock options are stock incentives in which employees benefit to the extent our stock price exceeds the strike price of the stock option before expiration 
a stock option is the right to purchase a share of our common stock at a predetermined exercise price 
for the stock options that we grant  the employee s exercise price is typically equivalent to our stock price on the date of the grant as set forth in our stock incentive plan 
typically  these employees vest in stock options in equal annual installments over a four year period and such options generally have a ten year term until expiration 
restricted shares are stock incentives in which employees receive the rights to own shares of our common stock and do not require the employee to pay an exercise price 
restricted shares include restricted stock units  performance shares and performance accelerated restricted stock units 
restricted stock units vest over a period of time 
performance shares vest at predetermined points in 
table of contents time if certain corporate performance goals are achieved or are forfeited if such goals are not met 
performance accelerated shares vest at a point in time  which may accelerate if certain stock performance measures are achieved 
fair value method of accounting 
on may   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r under the modified prospective method 
in accordance with sfas r  employee stock option grants and other stock based compensation are expensed over the vesting period  based on the fair value at the time the stock based compensation is granted 
the fair value of stock options granted was million  million  million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fair value of stock options granted will be recognized as stock compensation expense over the vesting period of the options 
our assumptions 
under the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  we measure stock option expense at the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
this model estimates the fair value of the options based on a number of assumptions  such as interest rates  employee exercises  the current price and expected volatility of our common stock and expected dividends  if any 
the following table presents the weighted average valuation assumptions used for the recognition of option compensation expense for stock options granted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal year expected life in years expected volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average exercise price weighted average option value the expected life is a significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk free interest rate  volatility and dividend yield must be applied 
the expected life is the average length of time in which we expect our employees to exercise their options 
expected stock volatility reflects movements in our stock price over a historical period that matches the expected life of the options 
the risk free interest rate is based on the expected us treasury rate over the expected life 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our expectations regarding the future payment of dividends 
sensitivity of assumptions 
if we assumed a basis point change in the following assumptions or a one year change in the expected life  the value of a newly granted hypothetical stock option would increase decrease by the following percentages basis points basis points expected life expected volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield sensitivity to changes in assumptions was determined using the black scholes valuation model with the following assumptions stock price and exercise price equal to the closing market price of 
table of contents del monte common stock on may   expected life of six years  risk free interest rate equal to the average of the may  rate for five year and seven year treasury constant maturity bonds  average stock volatility used during fiscal  and expected dividend yield of 
retained insurance liabilities our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations 
for example  liabilities may arise out of claims of employees  customers or other third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations 
we manage these risks through various insurance contracts from third party insurance carriers 
we  however  retain an insurance risk for the deductible portion of each claim 
for example  the deductible under our loss sensitive worker s compensation insurance policy is up to million per claim 
an independent  third party actuary is engaged to assist us in estimating the ultimate costs of certain retained insurance risks 
actuarial determination of our estimated retained insurance liability is based upon the following factors losses which have been reported and incurred by us  losses which we have knowledge of but have not yet been reported to us  losses which we have no knowledge of but are projected based on historical information from both our company and our industry  and the projected costs to resolve these estimated losses 
our estimate of retained insurance liabilities is subject to change as new events or circumstances develop which might materially impact the ultimate cost to settle these losses 
during fiscal and  we reduced our estimate of retained insurance liabilities related to prior years by approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of favorable claims history and reforms in california workers compensation benefits laws

although we expect to continue to pay dividends  the declaration and payment of future dividends  if any  is subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter and is limited by our senior credit facility and indentures 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividend policy 
we may from time to time consider other uses for our cash flow from operations and other sources of cash 
such uses may include  but are not limited to  future acquisitions  transformation or restructuring plans or share repurchases 
our primary sources of cash are typically funds we receive as payment for the products we produce and sell and from our revolver under our senior credit facility 
in august  the pension protection act of the act was signed into law 
in general  the act encourages employers to fully fund their defined benefit pension plans and meet incremental plan funding targets applicable prior to in addition  the act imposes certain consequences on our defined benefit plans if they do not meet certain minimum funding levels 
we no longer expect to meet the incremental plan funding targets or to fully fund our defined benefit pension plans by  although we currently meet and plan to continue to meet the minimum funding levels 
the act has resulted in  and in the future may additionally result in  accelerated funding of our defined benefit pension plans 
we made contributions of million in fiscal we currently expect to make contributions of approximately million in fiscal we continue to analyze the full impact of this law on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
refer to note retirement benefits of our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for a description of our defined benefit pension plans 
historically  we have used cash generated during the year to make voluntary pre payments of our term debt 
at the end of fiscal  we decided to retain this cash rather than pay down debt as we have significant debt payments coming due in fiscal as discussed later in this section  we expect to pursue refinancing of some or a large part of our debt prior to these payments coming due  
table of contents however  we have elected to retain this cash in order to have more flexibility with respect to refinancing our debt 
this cash has been invested in highly liquid  short term funds that invest in securities issued directly by the us government  securities issued by us government agencies and repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities 
depending on the timing of any refinancing  we expect to use this cash to partially fund our seasonal activity  reducing our need to draw on our revolver 
we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations and availability under our revolver will provide adequate funds for our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service obligations and planned pension plan contributions for at least the next months 
we anticipate peak use of our revolver for the upcoming fiscal year to occur in september or october  based on seasonal liquidity needs

revolver 
we use the revolver to fund our seasonal working capital needs  which are affected by  among other things  the growing cycles of the fruits  vegetables and tomatoes we process  and for other general corporate purposes 
the vast majority of our fruit  vegetable and tomato inventories are produced during the harvesting and packing months of june through october and depleted through the remaining seven months 
accordingly  our need to draw on the revolver fluctuates significantly during the year 
the outstanding revolver loan balance at both may  and april  was zero

the notes are also guaranteed by dmfc 
we have the option to redeem the notes at a premium beginning on december  and at face value beginning on december   subject to the concurrent payment of accrued and unpaid interest  if any  upon redemption 
the notes were exchanged for substantially identical registered notes pursuant to an exchange offer that was consummated on december  all of the holders of the originally issued notes exchanged such notes for new registered notes pursuant to the exchange offer 

table of contents through a private placement offering on february   dmc issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due february  the notes with interest payable semi annually on february and august of each year commencing august  certain subsidiaries of dmc guarantee dmc s obligations under the notes 
the notes are also guaranteed by dmfc 
we have the option to redeem the notes at a premium beginning on february  and at face value beginning on february   subject to the concurrent payment of accrued and unpaid interest  if any  upon redemption 
substantially all of the notes were exchanged for substantially identical registered notes pursuant to an exchange offer that was consummated on december  the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes contain customary restrictive covenants  events of default and other customary provisions for such indentures 
maturity table as of may   scheduled maturities or required payments of long term debt for each of the five succeeding fiscal years representing debt under our senior credit facility and the senior subordinated notes are as follows in millions at some time during the next months  we expect to pursue refinancing of some or a large part of our debt  particularly our debt under our senior credit facility in light of our scheduled maturities 
the timing  approach  and terms of any such refinancing would depend upon market conditions and management s judgment  among other factors 
given the current economic environment  we expect that the interest rates on our debt will increase as a result of any such refinancing 
in addition  the expenses associated with any such refinancing could be material 
restrictive and financial covenants our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to take certain actions 
our senior credit facility also contains financial covenants 
senior credit facility covenants 
the restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility include covenants limiting dmc s ability  and the ability of its subsidiaries  to incur liens  sell assets  including pursuant to sale leaseback transactions other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business  enter into consolidations or mergers  make loans and investments  incur or guarantee indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay certain indebtedness  and agree to restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other payments 
certain covenants in the senior credit facility apply to dmfc as well as dmc 
the senior credit facility also limits our ability to agree to certain change of control transactions  because a change of control as defined in the senior credit facility results in an event of default 
the financial covenants in our senior credit facility include a maximum total debt ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum permitted total debt ratio decreases over time and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio remains constant over time 
availability of borrowings under our senior credit facility is subject to these covenants 
our compliance with these financial 
table of contents covenants is tested on a quarterly basis 
the acceptable ratio levels of these financial covenants are designed to provide us with a reasonable degree of flexibility to account for normal variances in our operating results 
since different factors impact our financial covenants in unique ways  any of our financial covenants could become  at a point in time  the most restrictive of our financial covenants  depending upon our operating results and financial activities 
senior subordinated note indenture covenants 
as a general matter  the restrictive covenants set forth in our indentures are less restrictive than the comparable covenants in our senior credit facility 
the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing our notes are similar to the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing our notes 
the restrictive covenants in our senior subordinated note indentures include covenants limiting the ability of dmc  and the ability of dmc s restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures  to pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase capital stock  make loans and investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  incur additional indebtedness  enter into contingent obligations including guaranties  sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business  incur liens  agree to restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other payments  and enter into consolidations or mergers 
we have the option  subject to certain conditions  to designate any or all of dmc s subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under one or both of the senior subordinated note indentures  which such designation would exempt each subsidiary so designated from many of the restrictive covenants in the indentures 
to date  we have not exercised the option to designate any subsidiary as unrestricted 
the restrictive covenants in our senior subordinated note indentures include a covenant limiting the ability of dmfc to enter into any consolidation  merger or sale of substantially all of its assets 
in addition  the indentures limit our ability to agree to certain change of control transactions  because a change of control as defined in the indentures results  or  under the indenture governing the notes  may under certain conditions result in a requirement for us to make a change of control purchase offer to the noteholders at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
the senior subordinated note indentures do not contain financial covenants  but do require us to meet certain financial ratio requirements as a condition to taking certain actions including  under certain circumstances  incurring additional indebtedness 
the indenture governing our notes  but not our other indenture  contains a provision pursuant to which certain of the restrictive covenants set forth therein will be suspended at any time that the notes are rated investment grade  as defined in such indenture  if at such time no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
effect of restrictive and financial covenants 
the restrictive and financial covenants in our senior credit facility and indentures described above may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest or the interest of our stockholders  such as acquisitions  future stock repurchases or dividends 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividend policy 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants  and were in compliance therewith as of may  compliance with these covenants is monitored periodically in order to assess the likelihood of continued compliance 
our ability to continue to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants under the senior credit facility or the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes  there would be a default  which  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our indebtedness 
see item a 
risk factors restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and indentures may restrict our operational flexibility 
our ability to comply with these restrictions depends on many factors beyond our control 
if we fail to comply with these restrictions  we may be required to repay our debt 

table of contents dividends and stock repurchases during each quarter of fiscal  we declared a cash dividend of per share of company common stock 
accordingly  during fiscal  aggregate dividends of million were declared  and dividends of million were paid 
on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock over the next months 
under this authorization  repurchases may be made from time to time through a variety of methods  including open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  and block transactions 
on october  we entered into a rule b trading plan with a broker to facilitate the repurchase of the shares of the company s common stock 
shares repurchased under the trading plan were part of the million share repurchase authorized by our board of directors 
we repurchased a total of  shares of the company s common stock under this trading plan for a total cash outlay of million at an average price of per share 
all such shares were repurchased in the second and third quarters of fiscal we have no current plans to repurchase additional shares under the million authorization  however  we may resume repurchases at any time and  subsequently  may suspend or discontinue repurchases at any time 
obligations and commitments contractual and other cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual and other cash obligations at may  payments due by fiscal year total and thereafter in millions long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total contractual obligations purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments under supply  ingredient  packaging  co pack  grower commitments and other agreements 
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses at the end of fiscal  nor does the table reflect obligations we are likely to incur based on our plans  but are not currently obligated to pay 
many of our contracts are requirement contracts and currently do not represent a firm commitment to purchase from our suppliers 
therefore  requirement contracts are not reflected in the above table 
certain of our suppliers commit resources based on our planned purchases and we would likely be liable for a portion of their expenses if we deviated from our communicated plans 
in the above table  we have included estimates of the probable breakage expenses we would incur with these suppliers if we stopped purchasing from them as of may  aggregate future payments for our grower commitments are estimated based on may  pricing and fiscal volume 
aggregate 
table of contents future payments under employment agreements are estimated generally assuming that each such employee will continue providing services for the next five fiscal years  that salaries remain at fiscal levels  and that annual incentive awards to be paid with respect to each fiscal year shall be equal to the amounts actually paid with respect to fiscal  the most recent period for which annual incentive awards have been paid as of may  aggregate future payments under severance agreements do not include possible costs associated with outplacement services generally provided to executive officers whose employment is terminated without cause since such amounts have been minimal 
as of may   we had non current unrecognized tax benefits of million million net of tax benefits 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this amount 
as a result  this amount is not included in the table above 
standby letters of credit we have standby letters of credit for certain obligations related to operating leases  insurance requirements and our south america operations 
the majority of our standby letters of credit are automatically renewed annually  unless the issuer gives cancellation notice in advance 
on may   we had million of outstanding standby letters of credit 
cash flow in fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
cash provided by operating activities  provided by used in investing activities  and provided by used in financing activities for fiscal  and is presented in the table below 
fiscal year in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this million decrease was primarily driven by an increase in cash taxes paid and cash payments related to commodity futures positions 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million more than cash provided by operating activities during fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the increase in net income and the favorable timing of cash tax payments 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities was million during fiscal  which primarily consisted of million from the sale of the starkist seafood business  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal  which primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million driven by spending associated with the execution of our transformation plan and other capital projects  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of assets 

table of contents cash used in investing activities was  million during fiscal  which primarily consisted of  million used for the meow mix and milk bone acquisitions along with capital expenditures of million driven by spending associated with the execution of our transformation plan and other capital projects 
capital expenditures in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
capital spending for fiscal is expected to approximate to million and is expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash generated by operating activities 
in addition to capital expenditures  we enter into operating leases to support our ongoing operations 
the decision to lease  rather than purchase  an asset is the result of a number of considerations  including the cost of funds  the useful life of the asset  its residual value and technological obsolescence 
additionally  some equipment is proprietary to the lessor and cannot be purchased 
all material asset financing decisions include an evaluation of the potential impact of the financing on our debt agreements  including applicable financial covenants 
financing activities during fiscal  we used million in financing activities  which consisted primarily of net short term borrowings of million  term facility loan repayments of million and million in dividend payments 
during fiscal  we used million in financing activities  which consisted primarily of the net repayment of million in short term borrowings  term facility loan repayments of million  million in dividend payments and million in stock repurchases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a risk management program which was adopted with the objective of minimizing our exposure to changes in interest rates  commodity and other prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations alone or use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 
during fiscal  we were primarily exposed to the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  commodity and other prices and foreign currency exchange rates  which affect interest expense on our floating rate obligations and the cost of our raw materials and other inputs 
interest rates our debt primarily consists of floating rate term loans and fixed rate notes 
we also use our floating rate revolver primarily to fund seasonal working capital needs and other uses of cash 
interest expense on our floating rate debt is typically calculated based on a fixed spread over a reference rate  such as libor 
therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates will cause interest expense increases or decreases on a given amount of floating rate debt 

table of contents we manage a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swaps in which we receive floating rate payments and make fixed rate payments 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap  with a notional amount of million  as the fixed rate payer 
the swap has an effective date of october  and a maturity date of october  a formal cash flow hedge accounting relationship was established between the swap and a portion of our interest payment on our floating rate debt 
the fair value of our interest rate swap was recorded as a non current liability of million and million at may  and april   respectively 
assuming average floating rate loans during the year  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended may  and april   respectively 
commodities we purchase certain commodities such as soybean meal  corn  wheat  soybean oil and natural gas collectively  commodity contracts  in the course of normal operations 
as part of our commodity risk management activities  we use derivative financial instruments  primarily futures and options  to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity 
we use futures or options contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations on anticipated purchases 
we account for these commodities derivatives as either cash flow or economic hedges 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of derivative gains and losses is deferred in equity and recognized as part of cost of products sold in the appropriate period and the ineffective portion is recognized as other income or expense 
changes in the value of economic hedges are recorded directly in earnings 
on may   the fair values of our commodities hedges were recorded as current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
on april   the fair values of our commodities hedges were recorded as current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
other during portions of fiscal we carried out a hedging program for heating oil 
heating oil contracts are used as a proxy for fluctuations in diesel fuel prices 
these contracts generally have a term of less than twelve months and do not qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  associated gains and losses are recorded directly as other income or expense 
as of may   all such contracts were closed 
the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities 
sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes  nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity 
actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
may  april  in millions effect of a hypothetical change in fair value commodity contracts foreign currency we manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into forward contracts to cover a portion of our projected expenditures paid in local currency 
these contracts generally have a term of less than months and qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the effective derivative gains and losses are deferred in equity and recognized in the period the expenditure is incurred as part of cost of products sold or other income or expense 

table of contents the table below presents our foreign currency derivative contracts as of may  all of the foreign currency derivative contracts held on may  are scheduled to mature prior to the end of fiscal may  april  in millions contract amount mexican pesos in millions contract amount cad in millions a summary of the fair value and the market risk associated with a hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency hedges is as follows may  april  in millions fair value of foreign currency contracts  net asset liability potential net loss in fair value of a hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates as of may   we have changed our presentation of market risk disclosures from a tabular presentation of information related to market risk sensitive instruments to sensitivity analysis disclosures 
this change was made because we believe that sensitivity analysis more clearly depicts how changes in market prices would impact the fair value of our hedging instruments and  consequently  our financial position and results of operations
