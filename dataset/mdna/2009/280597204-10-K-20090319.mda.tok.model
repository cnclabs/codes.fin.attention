item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations going concern and continuing operations our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million and used million of cash in its operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and a total stockholders deficit of million 
due to uncertainty about our ability to meet our current operating expenses and capital expenditures  in our report on the annual financial statements for the year ended december   our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding the our ability to continue as a going concern 
the continuation of our business is dependent upon raising additional financial support 
the additional financing may be provided by common stock  debt  project financing  joint venture projects  a strategic alliance or business combination  or a combination of these 
the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders 
management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement or public offering of its common stock 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising additional cash to finance operations 
if not  we will be required to reduce operations and or liquidate assets and or seek relief through a filing under the us bankruptcy code 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern

the increase in revenue is directly related to the addition of new customers and expansion of existing customers that ediets corporate services manages 
advertising revenue from our website and our newsletter was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to fewer site visitors who observe third party banner impressions in the number of visitors to our websites declined in due to rising online advertising rates as well as our focus on targeting more of our advertising investments to meal delivery  we reduced our spending in the current year and shifted much of our advertising budget to offline campaigns versus online advertising 
this generated fewer visitors to our websites 
an additional factor that contributed to the decline in visitors to our websites in the second quarter of was the transition to our new technology platform 
during the transition we did not effectively transfer our website content which in turn had a negative impact on visitors obtained through traffic generated from natural search 
royalty revenues related to our licensing agreement with tesco were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

gross margin for digital plans declined from to because we did not reduce fixed costs as quickly as revenue declined

technology and development expenses also include depreciation of the computer hardware and capitalized software we use to run our web site and store our data

advertising expense in the first half of the year usually exceeds advertising in the second half of the year due to seasonality in the weight loss business 
as a result we have historically experienced proportionally lower or negative cash flows from operating activities in the first six months of each year

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable based upon information presently available 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
all of our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  of this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition we offer memberships to the proprietary content contained in our web sites 
revenues from customer subscriptions are paid in advance mainly via credit debit cards 
subscriptions to the digital plans are paid in advance and cash receipts are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period of the digital plan subscription 
beginning in january  we began to offer a guarantee to all customers  under which if a customer did not meet their weight loss goal upon completion of consecutive six months of digital subscription and met the guarantee requirements they would receive the next six months of digital subscription for free 
we recognize digital subscription revenue over the potential term of twelve months of digital subscription or until the subscriber no longer meets the guarantee requirements  whichever comes first 
in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  we recognize gross digital subscription revenues associated with licensed diet and fitness plans based on the relevant facts of the related license agreements  while the license fee incurred to the licensor is included in cost of revenues 
meal delivery revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete  which is upon transfer of title of the product 
this transfer occurs upon shipment from our fulfillment center to the end customer 
meal delivery revenue includes amounts billed for shipping 
in accordance with eitf  we recognize gross meal delivery revenues based on the relevant fact that we are the primary obligor and have assumed asset risk before the customers place any orders 
beginning in january we began offering two promotions a buy seven weeks of meal delivery and get the th week for free and b buy a meal delivery program and get a free non cash gift 
for the first promotion and in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf  we recognize the cost of the free offer as cost of revenue proportionally over the term of the meal delivery subscription or until the customer cancels and no longer is entitled to the free offer 
for the second promotion and in accordance with eitf  we recognize meal delivery revenue when the meals are shipped and the cost of the free non cash gift as cost of sales when the non cash gift is shipped 
business to business revenue relates to our ediets corporate services subsidiary 
ediets corporate services generates three types of business to business revenue 
licensing and development revenues are accounted for in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
development revenue relates to the planning  design and development of websites for customers 
both licensing and development revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the license period once the website is launched 
consulting revenue relates to consulting services provided to customers and revenue is recognized when services and or deliverables are completed and collection is probable 
advertising revenue is recognized in the period the advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant company obligation remains and collection is probable 
our obligations typically include guarantees of a minimum number of impressions or times that visitors to our web site view an advertisement 
amounts received or billed for which impressions have not yet been delivered are reflected as deferred revenue 
opt in email revenue is derived from the sale of email addresses of visitors to our web sites who have authorized us to allow third party solicitations 
revenues from the sale of email addresses are recognized when no significant company obligation remains and collection is probable 
ecommerce revenue is currently derived from the sale of our various health and fitness store products  including vitamin supplements  to consumers 
we offer an unconditional day guarantee on all of our products 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas  we recognize revenue on those products only when the guarantee period lapses 
royalty revenue is derived from the exclusive technology licensing agreement related to our operations in the united kingdom and ireland and is being recognized on a straight line basis 
our most significant accounting estimate is our reserve for refunds for digital plan and meal delivery 
since digital plan subscriber payments are deferred upon receipt  at the end of each month we reclassify a portion of our deferred revenue to reserve for refunds 
based on historical experience  approximately of digital plan subscriber sales will result in a refund issued in the subsequent month after sale 
all other refunds issued relate to current month digital plan subscriber sales 
because the revenue has not been recognized  refunds do not result in a reversal of digital plan subscription revenue 
instead  refunds result in a decrease to the amounts maintained in deferred revenue 
meal delivery refunds mainly result from late shipments or packaging issues 
based on historical experience  approximately of prior month s meal delivery sales will result in a refund  accordingly we estimate a reserve based on that assumption for future refunds 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the reserve for refunds 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions stated above  we may be exposed to income or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets sfas describes the reporting unit as an operating segment as that term is used in fasb statement no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
we operate in a single market consisting of the sale of services  information and products related to nutrition  fitness and motivation 
we have three reportable segments the us business to consumer segment  the us business to business segment and the european business segment 
we evaluate goodwill annually along these segment lines which represent our reporting units 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair value of the company s reporting units is based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
assumptions used in our impairment testing  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  and could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our impairment testing may be impacted by  among other things  our expected operating performance  ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments and competitive environment 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed impairment testing for our business to consumer segment due to continuing operating losses 
as a result  we determined that the business to consumer segment s goodwill was impaired 
this resulted in a non cash impairment of goodwill of approximately million to reduce the segment s goodwill to zero 
at december  we had million of goodwill related to the may acquisition of nutrio 
this goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and we noted no impairment as of december  accounting for employee stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  and related interpretations sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that method  compensation cost recognized in includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation is being recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for the prior periods have not been restated 
we also account for certain options and restricted share awards using variable accounting under sfas r as interpreted by eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf  which requires that such costs be measured at the end of each reporting period to account for changes in the fair value of our common stock until the stock options or restricted shares are vested 
common stock is valued using the market price of common stock on the measurement date as defined in eitf for such grants 
the fair value of restricted stock and vested shares is determined by the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  which requires estimates of the expected term of the option  the volatility of the company s stock price  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield 
we recognize expense for all share based awards based on the fair value of the number of awards we estimate will fully vest 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the estimated fair value of share based awards and the underlying expense recorded 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate 
accounting for income taxes effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with a few jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio as the interest rate related to our debt is fixed 
investments are made in accordance with our investment policy and consist of money market funds 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate risk 
due to the nature of these financial instruments the interest rate risk is deemed to be low 
we estimate that the cost of these financial instruments approximates fair value at december  foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros and british sterling pounds and fluctuations of the euro and british sterling pounds as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company has not implemented a hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk
