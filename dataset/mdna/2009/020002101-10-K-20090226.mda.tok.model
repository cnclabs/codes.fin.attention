with regard to funding agreements  we compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings 
the market for life insurance  retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive 
as of december   there were approximately groups of life insurance companies in the united states  most of which offered one or more similar products 
according to am best  as of december   the allstate financial segment is the nation s th largest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of ordinary life insurance in force and th largest on the basis of statutory admitted assets 
in addition  because many of these products include a savings or investment component  our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms  investment advisors  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors  including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses  as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry 
geographic markets we sell life insurance  retirement and investment  and voluntary accident and health insurance products throughout the united states 
through subsidiaries  we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all states  the district of columbia  puerto rico  the us virgin islands and guam

reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis

the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for gaap reporting  and a liability for the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for billion 
remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between gaap and statutory reporting 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate s net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of increased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions 
loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

favorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses 
effect of net reserve reestimates on calendar year operations in millions total by accident year prior total in  unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to allstate protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates 
in  favorable prior year reserve estimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  and  favorable prior year reserve estimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in  also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve estimates were due to increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines  partially offset by favorable allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve estimates were due to claim severity and late reported losses for allstate protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  unfavorable prior year reserve estimates were due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year which were reported in the year  additional incurred losses on the northridge earthquake  adverse results of class action and other litigation  upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the encompass and canadian businesses 
favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in and were the result of favorable severity trends in each year for allstate protection  which more than offset adverse reestimates in the discontinued lines and coverages segment  primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities  virtually all of which relates to and prior years 
the favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends  as compared to our anticipated trends 
favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs

regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation  primarily at the state level 
the method  extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries  not the holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  price setting  trade practices  policy forms  accounting methods  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  reserve adequacy  insurer solvency  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  and underwriting standards 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed 
in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
we cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
agent and broker compensation 
in recent years  several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies 
the proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers 
new disclosure requirements have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
insurance holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of florida  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york and texas  and some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in california and utah 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person that controls an insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in california  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  texas  and utah 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation s common stock 
price regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state s regulatory authority 
in many cases  such price schedules  policy forms or both must be approved prior to use 
while they vary from state to state  the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same a price cannot be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the pricing laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator s approval to use a price  but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
approximately one half of the states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of pricing laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing 
an insurer s ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
changes in allstate s claim settlement process may require allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process 
some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure  particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing has been the subject of challenges and investigations by regulators  legislators and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
national flood insurance program 
we voluntarily participate as a write your own wyo carrier in the national flood insurance program nfip 
the nfip is administered and regulated by the federal emergency management agency fema 
we operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the standard flood insurance policy sfip 
this involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the united states treasury 
we receive expense allowances from nfip for underwriting administration  claims management  commission and adjuster fees 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  states limit  to varying degrees  an insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities 
the sale and administration of variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission and the financial industry regulatory authority finra 
broker dealers  investment advisors and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission  finra and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
banking 
the allstate corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision 
the bank is also subject to the authority of the fdic and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information 
congress  state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
asbestos 
congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past  but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution and clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a mechanism to assign liability to prps or to fund the clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  has disputed and is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
while comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  only modest reform measures have been enacted

however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services 
these risks constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements and historical trends 
these cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this document  in our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec or in materials incorporated therein by reference 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and certain types of terrorism 
in catastrophe losses were billion and included estimates of losses for hurricanes ike and gustav  among other events 
we may continue to incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of those experienced in prior years  those that management projects would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis  those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability  the average expected level used in pricing  and our current reinsurance coverage limits 
despite our catastrophe management programs  we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial condition 
for example  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane katrina in totaling billion  the northridge earthquake of totaling billion and hurricane andrew in totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the california earthquake authority  and various state created catastrophe insurance facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and property claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to catastrophe losses along with others in the industry  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our property exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios 
such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models  which have been evolving since the early s  use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to its usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
these limitations are evident in significant variations in estimates between models and modelers  material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements  assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability  and actual event conditions that have not been well understood previously and not incorporated into the models 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of actual demand surge  loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses  which are subject to wide variation by event or location 
impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth due to our catastrophe risk management efforts  our short term growth has been negatively impacted and may continue to be negatively impacted if we take further actions 
homeowners premium growth rates and retention could be more adversely impacted than we expect by adjustments to our business structure  size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure 
in addition  due to the diminished potential for cross selling opportunities  new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our allstate protection segment 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowner s claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
examples of such events include a decision in by the georgia supreme court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under georgia law and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of texas during although we pursue various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
our allstate protection segment may experience declines in claim frequency from time to time 
the short term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a spike in gas prices and a significant decline in miles driven  both of which occurred in  are examples of factors leading to a short term frequency change 
a significant long term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix  and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines is inherently uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigation are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
for example  if allstate protection s loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may impose rate rollbacks  require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders  or resist or delay our efforts to raise rates even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases 
such resistance affects our ability  in all product lines  to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity  or as the facilities recognize a financial deficit  they may in turn have the ability to assess participating insurers  adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of implementing our sophisticated risk segmentation process may not be fully realized we believe that pricing sophistication and underwriting including strategic risk management which  in some situations  considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and sophisticated pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  our competitive advantage could decline or be lost 
further  the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our pricing sophistication model 
furthermore  we cannot be assured that these pricing sophistication models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated 
allstate protection s financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability and financial condition our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business 
management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts taking into account rating agencies and regulatory requirements 
we monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target new business returns on a portfolio basis  which could result in the discontinuation of products or distribution relationships and a decline in sales 
profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions 
our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment spreads  the management of market and credit risks associated with investments  the sufficiency of premiums and contract charges to cover mortality and morbidity benefits  the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses  and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances 
legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability and financial condition 
changes in reserve estimates may adversely affect our operating results reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions  adjustments to reserves and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial spread based products  such as fixed annuities and institutional products  is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates 
when market interest rates decrease or remain at relatively low levels  proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment spread 
lowering interest crediting rates in such an environment can partially offset decreases in investment yield on some products 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
decreases in the rates offered on products in the allstate financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals 
non parallel shifts in interest rates  such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates  can influence customer demand for fixed annuities  which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers  which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment s fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
this could lead to the sale of fixed income securities at a loss 
for certain products  principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products  the earned rate on assets could lag behind rising market yields 
we may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates  which could narrow spreads and reduce profitability 
unanticipated surrenders could result in accelerated amortization of dac or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment products may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition through increased amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to actual historical gross profits and estimated future gross profits egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the principal assumptions for determining the amount of egp are investment returns  including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities  interest crediting rates to contractholders  and the effects of persistency  mortality  expenses  and hedges if applicable 
updates to these assumptions commonly referred to as dac unlocking could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
in  dac unlocking resulted in increased amortization of dac of million 
narrowing the focus of our product offerings and reducing our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements may adversely affect reported results due to the current capital market conditions  we have been pursuing strategies to narrow our product offerings and reduce our concentration in fixed annuities and funding agreements 
lower new sales of these products  as well as our ongoing risk mitigation and return optimization programs  could negatively impact investment portfolio levels  complicate settlement of expiring contracts including forced sales of assets with unrealized capital losses  impact dac amortization  and affect goodwill impairment testing and insurance reserves deficiency testing 
a loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales certain products in the allstate financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us 
termination of one or more of these agreements due to  for example  a change in control of one of these distributors  could have a detrimental effect on the sales of allstate financial 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products and financial condition under current federal and state income tax law  certain products we offer  primarily life insurance and annuities  receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
risks relating to investments we are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality which may adversely impact investment income and cause additional realized losses although we continually reevaluate our proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs  we remain subject to the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity prices  interest rates  commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and  to a lesser degree  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in addition  we are subject to potential declines in credit quality  either related to issues specific to certain industries or to a general weakening in the economy 
although to some extent we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks  the effectiveness of such instruments is subject to the same risks 
a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio s average rate 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
a decline could also lead us to purchase longer term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
a declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease or decreasing interest rates could cause the funding target and the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans or the accumulated benefit obligation of our other post retirement benefit plans to increase  either or both resulting in a decrease in the funded status of the plans and a reduction of shareholders equity  increases in pension expense and increases in required contributions to the pension plans 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities  including realized losses relating to equity and derivative strategies 
deteriorating financial performance on securities collateralized by mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans may lead to write downs changes in mortgage delinquency or recovery rates  declining real estate prices  changes in credit or bond insurer strength ratings and the quality of service provided by service providers on securities in our portfolios could lead us to determine that write downs are appropriate in the future 
the impact of our investment strategies may be adversely affected by developments in the investment markets the impact of our investment portfolio risk mitigation and return optimization programs and enterprise asset allocation actions may be adversely affected by unexpected developments in the investment markets 
for example  derivative contracts  when entered into  may result in coverage that is not as effective as intended 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  collateral types  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition 
events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 
the determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments of our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition the determination of the amount of realized capital losses recorded for impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in realized capital gains and losses from impairments in operating results as such evaluations are revised 
there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of or amounts recorded for impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be recorded in the future 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
for example  the cost of our fixed income and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary in the period in which the determination is made 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the determination of the fair value of our fixed income and equity securities results in unrealized net capital gains and losses and is highly subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition in determining fair value we generally utilize market transaction data for the same or similar instruments 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information 
the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset or the amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
moreover  the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets and financial liabilities fair values 
the difference between amortized cost or cost and fair value  net of deferred income taxes  certain life and annuity dac  certain deferred sales inducement costs dsi  and certain reserves for life contingent contract benefits  is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
as of december   total unrealized net capital losses was billion 
in the last years  our quarterly net unrealized capital gains and losses have ranged from a billion net unrealized capital gain at june  to an billion net unrealized capital loss at december  changing market conditions could materially effect the determination of the fair value of our securities and unrealized net capital gains and losses could vary significantly 
determining fair value is highly subjective and could materially impact our operating results and financial condition 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include other insurers and  because many of our products include a savings or investment component  securities firms  investment advisers  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore  may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
our ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions  in developing the talent and skills of our human resources  in assimilating new executive talent into our organization  or in deploying human resource talent consistently with our business goals 
difficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results economists now believe the united states economy has entered into a recessionary period and are projecting significant negative macroeconomic trends  including widespread job losses  higher unemployment  lower consumer spending  continued declines in home prices and substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt  including defaults on home mortgages 
moreover  recent disruptions in the financial markets  particularly the reduced availability of credit and tightened lending requirements  have impacted the ability of borrowers to refinance loans at more affordable rates 
we cannot predict the length and severity of a recession  but as with most businesses  we believe a longer or more severe recession could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a general economic slowdown could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure on our investment portfolios 
consumer behavior could include decreased demand for our products 
for example  as consumers purchase fewer automobiles  our sales of auto insurance may decline 
also  as consumers become more cost conscious  they may choose lower levels of auto and homeowners insurance 
in  declining new car sales  weakness in the housing market and a highly competitive environment contributed to lower policies in force 
in addition  holders of some of our life insurance and annuity products may engage in an elevated level of discretionary withdrawals of contractholder funds 
our investment portfolios could be adversely affected as a result of deteriorating financial and business conditions affecting the issuers of the securities in our investment portfolio 
there can be no assurance that actions of the us federal government  federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets and stimulating the economy will achieve the intended effect in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system  the financial markets and the broader economy  the us federal government  the federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking action to address such conditions including  among other things  purchasing mortgage backed and other securities from financial institutions  investing directly in banks  thrifts and bank and savings and loan holding companies and increasing federal spending to stimulate the economy 
there can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets or on economic conditions 
such continued volatility and economic deterioration could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
losses from litigation may be material to our operating results or cash flows and financial condition as is typical for a large company  we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation  including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters  the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period and to our financial condition 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as insurance companies  broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies  many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  financial industry regulatory authority  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed  utilizing our risk management methodology  to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
for example  our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost  and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available next year 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including changes in market conditions  whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
we seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available 
additionally  in the event that terrorist acts occur  both allstate protection and allstate financial could be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control 
the current insurance financial strength ratings of allstate insurance company are a  aa and aa from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
the current insurance financial strength ratings of allstate life insurance company are a  aa and a from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
the allstate corporation currently maintains a senior debt rating of a  a and a from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies 
because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales  our competitiveness  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity 
in the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses  make payments on our indebtedness  pay for capital expenditures or fund acquisitions  our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant 
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as lenders perception of our long or short term financial prospects 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
if a combination of these factors were to occur  our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles  which are periodically revised  interpreted and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations  or could be subject to existing guidance as we enter into new transactions  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected 
for a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and  if known  our estimates of their expected impact  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the change in our unrecognized tax benefit during the next months is subject to uncertainty as required by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which was adopted as of january   we have disclosed our estimate of net unrecognized tax benefits and the reasonably possible increase or decrease in its balance during the next months 
however  actual results may differ from our estimate for reasons such as changes in our position on specific issues  developments with respect to the governments interpretations of income tax laws or changes in judgment resulting from new information obtained in audits or the appeals process 
the realization of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty the realization of our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  is based on our assumption that we will be able to fully utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes 
however  actual results may differ from our assumptions if adequate levels of taxable income are not attained 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service our debt and complete share repurchase programs in the timeframe expected 
the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  an industrial accident  a terrorist attack or war  events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing  transmission  storage and retrieval systems 
in the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster  our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised 
changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  profitability or cash flows allstate recognizes the scientific view that the world is getting warmer 
climate change  to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns  could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires  the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance and the results for our allstate protection segment 
to the extent that climate change impacts mortality rates and those changes do not match the long term mortality assumptions in our product pricing  the results for our allstate financial segment would be impacted 
loss of key vendor relationships could affect our operations we rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the united states and abroad 
these include  for example  vendors of computer hardware and software and vendors of services such as claim adjustment services and human resource benefits management services 
in the event that one or more of our vendors suffers a bankruptcy or otherwise becomes unable to continue to provide products or services  we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses

we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio is the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio is the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned

the most critical estimates include those used in determining fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities impairment of fixed income and equity securities deferred policy acquisition costs dac amortization reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation in applying these policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to our businesses and operations 
it is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates  see the referenced sections of this document

fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  for financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  and establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date  expands disclosures about financial instruments measured at fair value 
we categorize our financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value based on the observability of inputs to the valuation techniques  into a three level fair value hierarchy as follows level financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we can access 
level financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are based on the following a quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  b quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets  or c valuation models whose inputs are observable  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs may reflect our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the financial assets and financial liabilities 
observable inputs are those used by market participants in valuing financial instruments that are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
in the absence of sufficient observable inputs  unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in valuing financial assets and financial liabilities and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining fair values is inversely related to the availability of market observable information 
to distinguish among the categories  we consider the frequency of completed transactions such as daily trading for equity securities 
if inputs used to measure a financial instrument fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the entire instrument 
certain financial assets are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis  including investments such as mortgage loans  limited partnership interests  bank loans and policy loans 
accordingly  such investments are only included in the fair value hierarchy disclosure when the investment is subject to remeasurement at fair value after initial recognition and the resulting measurement is reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  equity options embedded in fixed income securities are not disclosed in the hierarchy with free standing derivatives  as the embedded derivatives are presented as combined instruments in fixed income securities 
we are responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting assumptions and methodologies 
we gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation input assumptions  valuation methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure that our financial assets and financial liabilities are appropriately valued 
we monitor fair values received from third parties and those derived internally on an ongoing basis 
in certain situations  we employ independent third party valuation service providers to gather  analyze  and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant assumptions and methodologies for individual instruments 
in situations where our valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security  fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a single quote or by employing internal valuation models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry 
changing market conditions are incorporated into valuation assumptions and reflected in the fair values  which are validated by calibration and other analytical techniques to available market observable data 
valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and  through the use of proprietary algorithms  produce valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements 
for certain equity securities  valuation service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date 
for other security types  fair values are derived from the valuation service providers proprietary valuation models 
the inputs used by the valuation service providers include  but are not limited to  market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities  interest rate yield curves  credit spreads  liquidity spread  currency rates  and other market observable information  as applicable 
credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities 
valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value the same financial instruments 
the valuation models take into account  among other things  market observable information as of the measurement date  as described above  as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term  interest rate  credit rating  industry sector  and where applicable  collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information 
executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience 
in cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited  the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information 
for certain of our financial assets carried at fair value  where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations  we obtain non binding price quotes from brokers familiar with the security who  similar to our valuation service providers  may consider transactions or activity in similar securities  as applicable  among other information 
the brokers providing price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of leading financial institutions with market making  underwriting and distribution expertise 
the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities  including privately placed securities  certain free standing derivatives and certain derivatives embedded in certain contractholder liabilities  where our valuation service providers or brokers do not provide fair value determinations  is determined using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry 
internally developed valuation models  which include inputs that may not be market observable and as such involve some degree of judgment  are considered appropriate for each class of security to which they are applied 
our internal pricing methods are primarily based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that determine a single best estimate of fair value for individual financial instruments 
in addition  our models use internally assigned credit ratings as inputs which are generally consistent with any external ratings and those we use to report our holdings by credit rating and stochastically determined cash flows for certain derivatives embedded in certain contractholder liabilities  both of which are difficult to independently observe and verify 
instrument specific inputs used in our internal fair value determinations include coupon rate  coupon type  weighted average life  sector of the issuer  call provisions  and the contractual elements of derivatives embedded in certain contractholder liabilities 
market related inputs used in these fair values  which we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments include interest rate yield curves  quoted market prices of comparable securities  credit spreads  estimated liquidity premiums  and other applicable market data including lapse and anticipated market return estimates for derivatives embedded in certain contractholder liabilities 
credit spreads are determined using those published by a commonly used industry specialist for comparable public securities 
a liquidity premium is also added to certain securities to reflect spreads commonly required for the types of securities being valued and are calibrated based on actual trades or other market data 
as a result of the significance of non market observable inputs  including internally assigned credit ratings and stochastic cash flow estimates as described above  judgment is required in developing these fair values 
the fair value of these financial assets and financial liabilities may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset or the amount paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
moreover  the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets and financial liabilities fair values 
fair value of our investments comprise an aggregation of numerous  single best estimates for each security in the consolidated statements of financial position 
because of this detailed approach  there is no single set of assumptions that determine our fair value estimates at a consolidated level 
moreover  management does not compile a range of estimates for items reported at fair value at the consolidated level because we do not believe that a range would provide meaningful information 
in the last years  our quarterly net unrealized capital gains and losses have ranged from a billion net unrealized capital gain at june  to an billion net unrealized capital loss at december  the change in net unrealized capital gains and losses by quarter over the year period has averaged billion and has ranged from a billion decrease to a billion increase 
level and level measurements represent valuations where all significant inputs are market observable 
level measurements have one or more significant inputs that are not market observable and as a result these fair value determinations have greater potential variability as it relates to their significant inputs 
the level principal components are privately placed securities valued using internal models and broker quoted securities 
additionally  due to the reduced availability of actual market prices or relevant observable inputs as a result of the decrease in liquidity that has been experienced in the market  all asset backed residential mortgage backed securities abs rmbs  auction rate securities ars backed by student loans  alt a residential mortgage backed securities alt a  other collateralized debt obligations cdo  certain asset backed securities abs and certain commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs are categorized as level in general  the greater the reliance on significant inputs that are not market observable  the greater potential variability of the fair value determinations 
for broker quoted securities fair value determinations  which were all categorized as level  we believe the brokers providing the quotes may consider market observable transactions or activity in similar securities  as applicable  and other information as calibration points 
privately placed securities fair value determinations  which are based on internal ratings that are not market observable and categorized as level  are calibrated to market observable information in the form of external national association of insurance commissioners naic ratings and credit spreads 
we believe our most significant exposure to changes in fair value is due to market risk 
our exposure to changes in market conditions is discussed fully in the market risk section of the md a 
we employ specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities 
our processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate  consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value 
for example  on a continuing basis  we assess the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous values received from those valuation service providers 
in addition  we may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from our valuation service providers to other third party valuation sources for selected financial assets 
when fair value determinations are expected to be more variable  we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions 
we do not alter fair values provided by our valuation providers or brokers 
the following table identifies investments as of december  by source of value determination investments in millions fair value percent to total fair value based on internal sources fair value based on external sources total fixed income  equity and short term securities fair value of derivatives mortgage loans  policy loans  bank loans and certain limited partnership and other investments  valued at cost  amortized cost and the equity method total includes billion that are valued using broker quotes

 see note of the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of fixed income and equity securities for investments classified as available for sale  the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities  net of certain other items and deferred income taxes as disclosed in note  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when the decline in fair value is deemed other than temporary 
the assessment of whether the impairment of a security s fair value is other than temporary is performed using a portfolio review as well as a case by case review considering a wide range of factors 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the expected recoverability of principal and interest  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issue or issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions which could affect liquidity 
additionally  once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to subsequently determine that an impairment is other than temporary  including general economic conditions that are worse than previously forecasted or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer or industry sector than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issue or issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances obtained that causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
examples of situations which may change our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or recovery include where significant unanticipated new facts and circumstances emerge or existing facts and circumstances increase in significance and are anticipated to adversely impact a security s future valuations more than previously expected  including negative developments that would change the view of long term investors and their intent to continue to hold the investment  subsequent credit deterioration of an issuer or holding  subsequent further deterioration in capital markets ie debt and equity and of economic conditions  subsequent further deterioration in the financial services and real estate industries  liquidity needs  federal income tax situations involving capital gains and capital loss carrybacks and carryforwards with specific expiration dates  investment risk mitigation actions  and other new facts and circumstances that would cause a change in our previous intent to hold a security to recovery or maturity 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity  since the majority of our portfolio is designated as available for sale and carried at fair value and as a result  any related net unrealized loss would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the determination of the amount of impairment is an inherently subjective process based on periodic evaluation of the factors described above 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in impairments in results of operations as such evaluations are revised 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the determination of the fair value of investments and the timing and amount of impairments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 
fixed income securities subject to other than temporary impairment write downs continue to earn investment income when future expected payments are both reasonably estimable and probable  and any discount or premium is recognized using the effective yield method over the expected life of the security  otherwise income recognition is discontinued

deferred policy acquisition costs amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring insurance policies and investment contracts 
in accordance with gaap  costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring insurance policies and investment contracts are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized into income as premiums are earned  typically over periods of six to twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac for allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment returns  which include investment income and realized capital gains and losses  as well as mortality  persistency and expenses to administer the business are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
the assumptions for determining dac amortization are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
generally  the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies 
the recovery of dac is dependent upon the future profitability of this business 
we periodically review the adequacy of reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
we aggregate all products accounted for pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
 in the analysis 
in the event actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions  any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and a premium deficiency reserve may be required if the remaining dac balance is insufficient to absorb the deficiency 
in  for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  an aggregate premium deficiency of million pre tax million after tax resulted primarily from a study indicating that the annuitants on certain life contingent contracts are projected to live longer than we anticipated when the contracts were issued and  to a lesser degree  a reduction in the related investment portfolio yield 
the deficiency was recorded through a reduction in dac 
in and  our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary  primarily due to projected income from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected deficiency in immediate annuities with life contingencies 
dac related to interest sensitive life  annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits  which includes both actual historical gross profits agp and estimated future gross profits egp expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the amortization is net of interest on the prior period dac balance using rates established at the inception of the contracts 
actual amortization periods generally range from years  however  incorporating estimates of customer surrender rates  partial withdrawals and deaths generally results in the majority of the dac being amortized during the surrender charge period 
the cumulative dac amortization is reestimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to results of operations when there is a difference between the incidence of actual versus expected gross profits in a reporting period or when there is a change in total egp 
agp and egp consist primarily of the following components contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits benefit margin  investment income and realized capital gains and losses less interest credited investment margin  and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses expense margin 
the amount of egp is principally dependent on assumptions for investment returns  including capital gains and losses on assets supporting contract liabilities  interest crediting rates to contractholders  and the effects of persistency  mortality  expenses  and hedges if applicable  and these assumptions are reasonably likely to have the greatest impact on the amount of dac amortization 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to reasonably predict their future movements or offsetting impacts over time 
each reporting period  dac amortization is recognized in proportion to agp for that period adjusted for interest on the prior period dac balance 
this amortization process includes an assessment of agp compared to egp  the actual amount of business remaining in force and realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting the product liability 
the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac depends upon which product liability is supported by the assets that give rise to the gain or loss 
if the agp is less than egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged  the amount of dac amortization will generally decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result generally occurs when the agp exceeds the egp in the period  but the total egp is unchanged 
annually  we review all assumptions underlying the projections of egp  including investment returns  comprising investment income and realized capital gains and losses  interest crediting rates  persistency  mortality  and expenses 
management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation of egp 
at each reporting period  we assess whether any revisions to assumptions used to determine dac amortization are required 
these reviews and updates may result in amortization acceleration or deceleration  which are commonly referred to as dac unlocking 
if the update of assumptions causes total egp to increase  the rate of dac amortization will generally decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
a decrease to earnings generally occurs when the assumption update causes the total egp to decrease 
over the past three years  our most significant dac assumption updates that resulted in a change to egp and the amortization of dac have been revisions to expected future investment returns  primarily realized capital losses  expenses  mortality and the number of contracts in force or persistency resulting in net dac amortization acceleration of million in  deceleration of million in and acceleration of million in the following table provides the effect on dac amortization of changes in assumptions relating to the gross profit components of investment margin  benefit margin and expense margin during the years ended december in millions investment margin benefit margin expense margin net acceleration deceleration dac amortization acceleration related to changes in the egp component of investment margin in was primarily due to the level of realized capital losses impacting actual gross profits in and the impact of realized capital losses on expected gross profits in the deceleration related to benefit margin was due to more favorable projected life insurance mortality 
the acceleration related to expense margin resulted from current and expected expense levels higher than previously projected 
dac amortization deceleration related to changes in the egp component of investment margin in was due to higher yields from repositioning of the investment portfolio and reduced interest crediting rates on annuities 
the deceleration related to benefit margin was due to more favorable projected life insurance mortality 
the acceleration related to expense margin was a result of expenses being higher than expected 
the following table displays the sensitivity of reasonably likely changes in assumptions included in the gross profit components of investment margin or benefit margin to amortization of the dac balance as of december  in millions december  increase reduction in dac increase in future investment margins of basis points decrease in future investment margins of basis points decrease in future life mortality by increase in future life mortality by any potential changes in assumptions discussed above are measured without consideration of correlation among assumptions 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to add them together in an attempt to estimate overall variability in amortization 
for additional discussion see the allstate financial segment and forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this document and note and of the consolidated financial statements 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued 
property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the financial statement date 
characteristics of reserves reserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle claims  less losses that have been paid 
the significant lines of business are auto  homeowners  and other lines for allstate protection  and asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines for discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection s claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported 
auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle  while auto physical damage  homeowners property and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year 
discontinued lines and coverages involve long tail losses  such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims  which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle 
reserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date 
reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims 
we update the majority of our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates reserve reestimates  which may be material  are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates  and the differences are recorded as property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determined 
estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables 
the actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates reserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique 
the actuarial technique is known as a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
the key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim counts  paid losses  case reserves  and development factors calculated with this data 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current period experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into the next time period 
the development factors for the future time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining future periods to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
the implicit assumption of this technique is that an average of historical development factors is predictive of future loss development  as the significant size of our experience data base achieves a high degree of statistical credibility in actuarial projections of this type 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor includes an adequate provision 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by external and internal factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
how reserve estimates are established and updated reserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level  and the results of these numerous micro level best estimates are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate 
for example  over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to estimate losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
the actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims by determining the development factors for specific data elements that are necessary components of a reserve estimation process 
development factors are calculated quarterly for data elements such as  claim counts reported and settled  paid losses  and paid losses combined with case reserves 
the calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity trends  which is a common industry reference used to explain changes in reserve estimates 
the historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these micro level estimates are not based on a single set of assumptions 
actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components of certain micro level estimates generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves 
moreover  this detailed micro level process does not permit or result in a compilation of a company wide roll up to generate a range of needed loss reserves that would be meaningful 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balance carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
reserves are reestimated quarterly  by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors 
this process incorporates the historic and latest actual trends  and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates 
new development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results claims reported or settled  losses paid  or changes to case reserves occur differently than the implied assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations 
if claims reported  paid losses  or case reserve changes are greater or lower than the levels estimated by previous development factors  reserve reestimates increase or decrease 
when actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate  a new reserve is determined 
the difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves the previous estimate is the amount of reserve reestimate and an increase or decrease in property liability insurance claims and claims expense will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
total property liability reserve reestimates  after tax  as a percent of net income  in  and were  and  respectively 
for property liability  the year average of reserve reestimates as a percentage of total reserves was a favorable  for allstate protection  the year average of reserve estimates was a favorable and for discontinued lines and coverages the year average of reserve reestimates was an unfavorable  each of these results being consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for our respective businesses 
allstate protection reserve reestimates were primarily the result of claim severity development that was better than expected and late reported loss development that was better than expected due to lower frequency trends  and for discontinued lines and coverages  reestimates were primarily a result of increased reported claim activity claims frequency 
a more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
the following table shows claims and claims expense reserves by operating segment and line of business as of december in millions allstate protection auto homeowners other lines total allstate protection discontinued lines and coverages asbestos environmental other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages total property liability allstate protection reserve estimates factors affecting reserve estimates reserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends as previously described 
these estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  differing payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  changes in law and regulation  judicial decisions  and economic conditions 
when we experience changes of the type previously mentioned  we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends  such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two year  three year  or longer development periods to reestimate our reserves 
for example  if a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate 
another example would be when a change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line  coverage  or state  actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development 
as claims are reported  for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity  the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost  based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim 
for other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame  it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim  and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimation techniques previously described 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
historically  the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims 
to provide for this  a development reserve is estimated using previously described processes  and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves 
typically  the case and supplemental development reserves comprise about of total reserves 
another major component of reserves is ibnr 
typically  ibnr comprises about of total reserves 
generally  the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on severity assumptions for different business segments  lines  and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators  and reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes previously described 
changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the maintenance and repair price index and the parts equipment price index 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim review and settlement process  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various other loss management initiatives underway  contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors 
as loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss  it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility 
from that point in time and forward  reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes 
statistical credibility is usually achieved by the end of the first calendar year  however  when trends for the current accident year exceed initial assumptions sooner  they are usually given credibility  and reserves are increased accordingly 
the very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors  limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of data elements 
however  by applying standard actuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types  comprising auto injury losses  auto physical damage losses and homeowner losses  we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors  as described in the section titled  potential reserve estimate variability below 
causes of reserve estimate uncertainty since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate 
at each reporting date  the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes  and medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter 
reserves for catastrophe losses property liability claims and claims expense reserves also include reserves for catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  winter storms  tornadoes  hailstorms  wildfires  tropical storms  hurricanes  earthquakes  and volcanoes 
we are also exposed to man made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described previously 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  as noted above  the estimation process can be further complicated 
for example  for hurricanes  complications could include the inability of insureds to be able to promptly report losses  limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses  determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain  or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood  estimating additional living expenses  and assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations  including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events  such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period  which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period 
in these situations  we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe 
as an example  in to complete an estimate for certain areas affected by hurricane katrina and not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff  or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive  we relied on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total policies in force  as well as visual  governmental and third party information  including aerial photos  area observations  and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available 
potential reserve estimate variability the aggregation of numerous micro level estimates for each business segment  line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  and major states or groups of states for reported losses and ibnr forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates  there is not a single set of assumptions that determine our reserve estimates at the consolidated level 
given the numerous micro level estimates for reported losses and ibnr  management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful 
reserve estimates  by their very nature  are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment  and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim 
accordingly  as actual claims  and or paid losses  and or case reserve results emerge  our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated 
to develop a statistical indication of potential reserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes  an actuarial technique stochastic modeling is applied to the countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses  auto physical damage losses  and homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses 
based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements  an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last eleven years for each type of loss 
the variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience  the statistical credibility of our extensive data  and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be approximately plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
a lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses  which comprise approximately of reserves  due to their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims 
other types of losses  such as auto physical damage  homeowners losses and other losses  which comprise about of reserves  tend to have greater variability  but are settled in a much shorter period of time 
although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates we believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodology  facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils  and state  for reported losses and for ibnr losses and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
due to the uncertainties involved  the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
discontinued lines and coverages reserve estimates characteristics of discontinued lines exposure we continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who were exposed to asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large us companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on large us companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products 
in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance  or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
how reserve estimates are established and updated we conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive grounds up methodology determines asbestos reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg environmental damages  respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties  appropriateness and cost of remediation to pollution and related clean up costs 
the number and cost of these claims is affected by intense advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs  and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities  initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims  often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur 
after evaluating our insureds probable liabilities for asbestos and or environmental claims  we evaluate our insureds coverage programs for such claims 
we consider our insureds total available insurance coverage  including the coverage we issued 
we also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any 
evaluation of both the insureds estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment 
this analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel 
based on these evaluations  case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an ibnr reserve  which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported 
as of december  and  ibnr was and  respectively  of combined asbestos and environmental reserves 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 
other discontinued lines and coverages the following table shows reserves for other discontinued lines which provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental as of december in millions other mass torts workers compensation commercial and other other discontinued lines other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary  direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
potential reserve estimate variability establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability  availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability  the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  and other uncertainties 
there are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of this document 
adequacy of reserve estimates management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws  regulations  and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required

reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation benefits for these policies are payable over many years  accordingly  the reserves are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected net premiums 
long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits payable under insurance policies including traditional life insurance  life contingent immediate annuities and voluntary health products 
these assumptions  which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued  are consistent with assumptions for determining dac amortization for these policies  and are generally not changed during the policy coverage period 
however  if actual experience emerges in a manner that is significantly adverse relative to the original assumptions  adjustments to dac or reserves may be required resulting in a charge to earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves and recoverability of dac for these policies on an aggregate basis using actual experience 
in the event that actual experience is significantly adverse compared to the original assumptions  any remaining unamortized dac balance must be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the effects of changes in reserve estimates are reported in the results of operations in the period in which the changes are determined 
in  for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  an aggregate premium deficiency of million pre tax million after tax resulted primarily from a study indicating that the annuitants on certain life contingent contracts are projected to live longer than we anticipated when the contracts were issued and  to a lesser degree  a reduction in the related investment portfolio yield 
the deficiency was recorded through a reduction in dac 
in and  our reviews concluded that no premium deficiency adjustments were necessary  primarily due to projected income from traditional life insurance more than offsetting the projected deficiency in immediate annuities with life contingencies 
we will continue to monitor the experience of our traditional life insurance and immediate annuities 
further significant changes in mortality experience or the portfolio yield could result in additional charges in future periods 
the company has not recognized a charge of this nature in previous years 
we anticipate that mortality  investment and reinvestment yields  and policy terminations are the factors that would be most likely to require adjustment to these reserves or related dac

allstate protection comprises two brands  the allstate brand and encompass brand 
allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting income loss  a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income on page  is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges  as determined using gaap 
we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
net income is the gaap measure most directly comparable to underwriting income loss 
underwriting income loss should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting income loss as a percentage of premiums earned 
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods 
effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
this ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses 
effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the discontinued lines and coverages segment to property liability premiums earned 
the sum of the effect of discontinued lines and coverages on the combined ratio and the allstate protection combined ratio is equal to the property liability combined ratio

the key elements of the allstate protection strategy of consumer focus  innovation and loyalty are build customer loyalty increase distribution effectiveness maintain leadership in pricing sophistication provide innovative products and services extend our claims competitive advantage maintain a strong support foundation by continuing to effectively manage people  investments  technology and capital in our strategy for the allstate brand  we are seeking  through the utilization of our distribution channels  our pricing sophistication and targeted consumer marketing  to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
we maintain a comprehensive marketing approach throughout the us we have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on allstate brand profitability  pif growth  retention  and sales of financial products 
we differentiate the allstate brand from competitors by offering a choice of products  including allstate your choice auto insurance yca with options such as safe driving deductibles and a safe driving bonus  allstate your choice home ych with options such as a claim free bonus and greater ability to tailor insurance coverage and allstate blue sm  our non standard auto product with features such as a loyalty bonus and roadside assistance coverage 
our strategy for the encompass brand includes enhancing our pricing and product offering by applying pricing sophistication to the encompass edge product  increasing distribution effectiveness and improving agency technology interfaces to support profitable growth 
our pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential  and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard non standard model 
pricing sophistication which underlies our strategic risk management program uses a number of risk evaluation factors including  to the extent legally permissible  insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports 
we continue to expand the number of price points with successive rating program releases 
substantially all of new and approximately of renewal business written for allstate brand auto are rated using our pricing sophistication methods 
for allstate brand homeowners  approximately of new and of renewal business written are rated using pricing sophistication methods 
for allstate brand auto and homeowners business  our results indicate that over time  use of these methods has improved our mix of customers towards those who we consider high lifetime value that generally have better retention and more favorable loss experience 
the allstate protection segment also includes a separate organization called emerging businesses which is comprised of small business commercial  consumer household specialty product lines  allstate dealer services allstate credit division and allstate roadside services allstate motor club and partnership marketing group 
consumer household and allstate roadside services accounted for billion or and million or of emerging businesses premiums written in  respectively 
we expect to accelerate growth in high value areas of emerging businesses  including consumer household and allstate roadside services  during we are pursuing improvements in the overall customer experience through actions targeted to increase customer satisfaction and retention 
these programs are designed around establishing customer service expectations and customer relationship building 
our claims strategy focuses on delivering fast  fair and consistent claim service while achieving loss cost management and customer satisfaction 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand s exclusive agencies and our direct channel 
we continue to manage our property catastrophe exposure in order to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability of our earnings  while providing protection to our customers 
our property business includes personal homeowners  commercial property and other property lines 
at december   we continue to be within our goal to have no more than a likelihood of exceeding our expected annual aggregate catastrophe losses by billion  net of reinsurance  based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available 
the use of different assumptions and updates to industry models could materially change the projected loss 
property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes  earthquakes  wildfires  fires following earthquakes and other catastrophes 
we are working for changes in the regulatory environment  including fewer restrictions on underwriting  recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions for large catastrophes 
while the actions that we take will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our property business  we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines 
pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
additionally  property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products 
premiums written  an operating measure  is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
premiums earned is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
since the allstate brand policy periods are typically months for auto and months for homeowners  and the encompass standard auto and homeowners policy periods are typically months and non standard auto policy periods are typically months  rate changes will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of to months 
during this period  premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
the following table shows the unearned premium balance at december and the timeframe in which we expect to recognize these premiums as earned

we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds  winter storms  tornadoes  hailstorms  wildfires  tropical storms  hurricanes  earthquakes  and volcanoes

dac we establish a dac asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business  principally agents remuneration  premium taxes  certain underwriting costs and direct mail solicitation expenses

however  this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure 
consequently  we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the california earthquake authority cea  florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf or placed with a third party  such as hurricane coverage in hawaii 
the average annual impact of all catastrophes  excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki and losses from california earthquakes  on our property liability loss ratio was points since the beginning of comparatively  the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years through is shown in the following table 
average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki  and losses from california earthquakes florida other hurricane exposure states total hurricane exposure states all other total over time  we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
limitations include our participation in various state facilities  such as the cea  which provides insurance for california earthquake losses  the fhcf  which provides reimbursements on certain qualifying florida hurricane losses  and other state facilities  such as wind pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values  the effect of state insurance laws and regulations 
in addition  in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools  we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities 
in and  both pif and the renewal ratio were suppressed by our catastrophe management actions such as our decision to discontinue offering coverage by allstate floridian insurance company and its subsidiaries allstate floridian on approximately  property policies as part of renewal rights and reinsurance arrangements with royal palm insurance company royal palm entered into in and royal palm and 
approximately of the policies involved in royal palm and expired in and therefore negatively influenced the pif and renewal ratio 
we continue to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events  including the following we have reduced property pif in coastal management areas thereby lowering hurricane exposures 
this includes texas and louisiana where the combination of reduced property pif and ceded wind coverage in the coastal regions reduced our loss exposures to wind by and  respectively  below levels 
we have increased our utilization of wind storm pools  including in texas where we are ceding all wind exposure related to insured property located in all wind pool eligible areas along the coast including the galveston islands 
we have ceased writing new homeowners business in california 
we will continue to renew current policyholders and have a renewal ratio of approximately in california 
encompass floridian insurance and encompass floridian indemnity company filed a formal notification with the florida office of insurance regulation to discontinue providing property insurance in the state of florida 
we ceased offering renewals on certain homeowners insurance policies in new york in certain down state geographical locations 
the level of non renewals in new york is governed by state statute 
hurricanes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states 
generally  the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than other areas 
however  average premiums are not considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss 
we have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by  among other actions  purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in areas most exposed to hurricanes for further information on our reinsurance program see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a  limiting personal homeowners new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states  not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states  and entering into royal palm and our actions are expected to continue during in northeastern and certain other hurricane prone states 
earthquakes during  we began taking actions countrywide to significantly reduce our exposure to the risk of earthquake losses 
these actions included purchasing reinsurance on a countrywide basis and in the state of kentucky  no longer offering new optional earthquake coverage in most states  removing optional earthquake coverage upon renewal in most states  and entering into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through other insurers for new and renewal business 
actions taken to reduce our exposure from optional earthquake coverage are substantially complete 
we expect to retain approximately  pif due to regulatory and other reasons 
we also will continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies and coverages that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses  including our auto policies  and to fires following earthquakes 
allstate policyholders in the state of california are offered coverage through the cea  a privately financed  publicly managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage 
allstate is subject to assessments from the cea under certain circumstances as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements 
fires following earthquakes actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in california and purchasing additional reinsurance on a countrywide basis excluding florida and on a statewide basis in california and kentucky 
wildfires actions we are taking to reduce our risk of loss from wildfires include changing homeowners underwriting requirements in certain states and including california wildfire losses in our aggregate excess reinsurance agreement 
catastrophe losses related to the southern california wildfires that occurred during and totaled million and million  respectively 
reinsurance we expect to renew expiring coverages including the coverage expiring on programs placed for years aggregate excess  years various state specific and year south east and florida 
we anticipate purchasing coverage that has similar retentions and limits as our expiring program with either retentions and limits or premiums being subject to re measurement for exposure differences from estimates initially provided to reinsurers 
our program will be in place by june  we expect to bind coverage in march  except for certain coverage in florida which we expect to bind by june  we anticipate reporting the details at that time 
we estimate that the total annualized cost of our catastrophe reinsurance program for the year beginning june   including the new pennsylvania up to million limit  million retention and texas louisiana up to million limit  million retention agreements  to be within of our expiring annualized reinsurance contract premiums of million 
we continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities 
allstate protection outlook allstate protection premiums written in are anticipated to be lower than levels due to continued emphasis on preserving auto insurance margins by providing customer focused products and services 
short term growth will be limited reflecting a transition to a value based strategy in the competitive environment as consumers buy fewer autos and choose lower product coverages  and reductions of catastrophe exposure 
we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results  however  this volatility will be somewhat mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions  including purchases of reinsurance 
we plan to continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced 
discontinued lines and coverages segment overview the discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment 
we have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling  policy coverage interpretation  exposure identification and reinsurance collection

see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a for a more detailed discussion 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos and or environmental losses in the future 
these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site cleanup from the new administration 
because of our annual grounds up review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
we continue to be encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity has slowed  perhaps reflecting various state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims 
property liability investment results net investment income decreased in when compared to  after increasing in when compared to the decrease was due to decreased partnership income and lower average asset balances reflecting dividends paid by allstate insurance company aic to its parent  the allstate corporation the corporation and capital contributions to allstate life insurance company alic and reduced portfolio yields

property liability claims and claims expense reserves property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves

these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
the facts and circumstances leading to our quarterly reestimates of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are likely different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
at december   the impact of a reserve reestimation corresponding to a one percent increase or decrease in net reserves would be a decrease or increase of approximately million in net income

in  this was primarily due to auto injury severity development and late reported loss development that was better than expected and changes in reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses which were favorable in these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends based on the indications of updated development factor calculations 
the impact of these reestimates on the allstate brand underwriting income is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates allstate brand underwriting income reserve reestimates as a of underwriting income encompass brand reserve reestimates in  and were related to lower than anticipated claim settlement costs 
the impact of these reestimates on the encompass brand underwriting loss income is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates encompass brand underwriting loss income reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss income discontinued lines and coverages we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive grounds up methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by policyholders 
reserve reestimates for the discontinued lines and coverages  as shown in the table below  were increased primarily for other discontinued lines in  environmental in and for asbestos in in millions jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate asbestos claims environmental claims other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages underwriting loss reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss reserve additions for asbestos in  and  totaling million  million and million  respectively  were primarily for products related coverage 
they were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess and primary insurance policyholders with existing active claims  excess policyholders with new claims  and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions  as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
higher claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported 
these trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry  which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation and bankruptcy actions 
the asbestos reserve addition also includes the write off of uncollectible reinsurance for a single foreign reinsurer 
normal environmental claim activity resulted in essentially no change in estimated reserves for the reserve additions for environmental in were for increased claim activity related to site specific remediations where the clean up cost estimates and responsibility for the clean up have been more fully determined 
this increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported

this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
in  the asbestos net year survival ratio increased due to lower average annual payments 
in  the asbestos net year survival ratio declined due to continuing claim payments 
in  the environmental net year survival ratio declined due to continuing claim payments 
in  the environmental net year survival ratio increased due to reserve additions

we purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure 
the price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process  along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders 
we also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including industry pools and facilities  which are backed by the financial resources of the property liability insurance company market participants  and have historically purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
the impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at december are summarized in the following table  net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense reinsurance recoverables  net in millions industry pools and facilities asbestos and environmental other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables total property liability reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements  including incurred but not reported unpaid losses 
we calculate our ceded reinsurance estimate based on the terms of each applicable reinsurance agreement  including an estimate of how ibnr losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement 
we also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our reinsurance agreements 
accordingly  our estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserve for property liability claims and claims expense 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent and  respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances 
the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  and other relevant factors 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers which may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
we employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
we also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants  and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries 
for further discussion on the decrease in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
there has also been consolidation activity in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectability of reinsurance recoverables in the future

our program provides reinsurance protection to us for catastrophes including storms named or numbered by the national weather service  wildfires  earthquakes and fires following earthquakes 
our catastrophe reinsurance program which will be effective june  is currently being negotiated 
we expect to bind coverage in march  except for certain coverage in florida which we expect to bind by june  we anticipate reporting the details of our catastrophe reinsurance program renewal upon finalizing coverage 
see the allstate corporation annual report on form k for and the allstate corporation form qs for for additional details on our current program 
we expect to renew expiring coverages including the coverage expiring on programs placed for years aggregate excess  years various state specific  and year south east and florida 
we anticipate purchasing coverage that has similar retentions and limits as our expiring program  with either retentions and limits or premiums being subject to re measurement for exposure differences from estimates initially provided to reinsurers 
in addition  effective june   we are contemplating two new agreements a pennsylvania only agreement up to million limit  million retention to enhance protection in pennsylvania  and a texas louisiana agreement up to million limit  million retention whereby losses resulting from the same named or numbered storm but taking place in both texas and louisiana may be combined to meet the agreement s per occurrence retention and limit 
we also intend to purchase a portion of our annual florida reinsurance program in the first quarter of  deferring our remaining florida reinsurance purchase until the fhcf reimbursement program is finalized 
our reinsurance program  effective june  to may  is comprised of agreements that provide coverage for the occurrence of certain qualifying catastrophes in specific states including new york  new jersey  connecticut  rhode island and texas multi peril  additional coverage for hurricane catastrophe losses in new york  new jersey and connecticut north east in other states along the southern and eastern coasts south east and in texas texas  in california for fires following earthquakes california fires following earthquakes  in kentucky for earthquakes and fires following earthquakes kentucky  and four agreements for our exposure in florida 
the florida component of the reinsurance program  which expires on may   is designed separately from the other components of the program to address the distinct needs of our separately capitalized legal entities in that state 
another reinsurance agreement provides coverage nationwide  excluding florida  for the aggregate or sum of catastrophe losses in excess of an annual retention associated with storms named or numbered by the national weather service  california wildfires  earthquakes and fires following earthquakes aggregate excess 
for further discussion on catastrophe reinsurance  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the multi peril agreements have various retentions and limits commensurate with the amount of catastrophe risk  measured on an annual basis  in each covered state 
the multi peril agreement for connecticut and rhode island provides that losses resulting from the same occurrence but taking place in both states may be combined to meet the agreement s per occurrence retention and limit 
one third of the coverage expires each year with each of the three contracts in this agreement 
the north east agreement was placed with willow re ltd  a cayman island insurance company  and covers allstate protection personal property and auto excess catastrophe losses 
amounts payable under the reinsurance agreement are based on an index created by applying predetermined percentages representing our market share to insured personal property industry losses in new york  new jersey and connecticut as reported by property claim services pcs  a division of insurance services offices  inc  limited to our actual losses 
this agreement covers of million  our estimated share of estimated modified personal property industry catastrophe losses between billion and billion  or of our catastrophe losses between billion initial trigger and billion exhaustion point in the states of new york  new jersey and connecticut 
the initial trigger and exhaustion points are reset by air worldwide corporation air annually based on changes in the underlying industry exposures and our share of industry exposures 
willow re ltd 
issued to unrelated investors principal at risk variable market rate notes of million to collateralize hurricane catastrophe losses covered by this reinsurance agreement 
willow re ltd 
entered into a total return swap with lehman brothers special financing  inc lehman which guaranteed the value of the collateral and a predetermined fixed rate of return to be paid to note holders 
upon the failure of lehman in the third quarter of  the total return swap was settled and terminated without replacement 
allstate continues to make the required premium payments to willow re and the reinsurance remains in place  but the underlying assets have not generated enough interest to meet the quarterly bond interest payment requirement due in february  resulting in a default to note holders 
the default does not create any obligations for allstate and the reinsurance contract remains in place  although the value of the reinsurance provided by willow re depends upon the market value of the underlying assets held in collateral for reinsurance trust  with allstate as the beneficiary 
the underlying assets held in collateral are comprised largely of illiquid mortgaged backed securities and cash with a current market value less than million 
the texas agreement provides coverage for allstate protection personal property excess catastrophe losses in texas for hurricane catastrophe losses 
the agreement was placed with willow re ltd  which completed an offering to unrelated investors for principal at risk  variable market rate notes of million to collateralize hurricane catastrophe losses covered by this agreement 
amounts payable under the reinsurance agreement will be based on an index created by applying predetermined percentages representing our market share to insured personal property industry losses in texas as reported by pcs limited to our actual losses 
the limits on our texas agreement are designed to replicate as close as possible of million  our estimated market share of estimated modified personal property industry catastrophe losses between billion and billion  or of our catastrophe losses between million retention and billion exhaustion point 
the texas agreement placed with willow re is independent of the north east agreement and is not impacted by the termination of the north east agreement s total return swap 
the florida reinsurance program  which will be effective june   should be similar in design to the current program  however containing limits based on reduced underlying exposure  assuming there is no further change in florida insurance markets 
our current program comprises  four separate agreements entered into by allstate floridian for personal property excess catastrophe losses in florida  effective june  for one year 
these agreements coordinate coverage with the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  including our elected participation in the optional temporary increase in coverage limit ticl  collectively fhcf 
we chose not to participate in the optional temporary emergency additional coverage option teaco that is below the mandatory fhcf coverage 
the fhcf provides reimbursement on qualifying allstate floridian property losses up to an estimated maximum of million in excess of a million retention  including reimbursement of eligible loss adjustment expenses at  for each of the two largest hurricanes and million for all other hurricanes for the season beginning june  the four agreements are listed and described below 
fhcf retention provides coverage on million of losses in excess of million and is placed  with one prepaid reinstatement of limit 
fhcf sliver provides coverage on co participation of the fhcf payout  or million and is placed  with one prepaid reinstatement of limit 
fhcf back up provides coverage after the exhaustion of an amount equivalent to the anticipated fhcf reimbursement protection on million of losses in excess of million and is placed 
fhcf excess provides coverage on million of losses in excess of the fhcf retention  fhcf and the fhcf back up agreements and is placed  with one prepaid reinstatement of limit 
we are currently evaluating the fhcf s capacity to timely reimburse us in the event of a major catastrophe  and await any changes that might be made by the fl legislature 
we have approximately million or of the aggregate excess agreement limits for the june  to may  period  million or of the south east agreement limit  million or of the north east agreement limit  million or of the texas agreement  and million or less than of the florida limit placed with alternative market sources 
alternative market sources refers to a reinsurer that hedge funds  private equity firms  or investment banks substantially or wholly support  retrocedes of its assumed liability to a specific retrocessionaire  provides collateral to us equal to its assumed per occurrence limit  or funding is provided by an unrelated third party issuance of bonds financing the reinsurance limit catastrophe bond 
our total annualized cost for catastrophe reinsurance for the year beginning june  is million originally million before annual exposure re measurements 
the total cost of our reinsurance program during was million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
we estimate that the total annualized cost of our catastrophe reinsurance program for the year beginning june   including the new pennsylvania and texas louisiana agreements  to be within of our expiring annualized reinsurance contract premiums of million 
we continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities 
the reinsurance agreements have been placed in the global reinsurance market  with all limits on our current florida program and the majority of limits on our other programs placed with reinsurers who currently have an am best insurance financial strength rating of a or better 
the remaining limits are placed with reinsurers who currently have an am best insurance financial strength rating no lower than a  with three exceptions

total revenues decreased or million in compared to  due to higher net realized capital losses and lower premiums and contract charges  partially offset by higher net investment income 
life and annuity premiums and contract charges premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life insurance  immediate annuities with life contingencies  and accident  health and other insurance products that have significant mortality or morbidity risk 
contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive and variable life insurance  fixed annuities and variable annuities for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities 
contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance  administration  cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates 
as a result  changes in contractholder funds are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues

total premiums decreased in compared to as higher sales of accident and health insurance products sold through the allstate workplace division and traditional life insurance products were more than offset by a decline in sales of life contingent immediate annuities due to market competitiveness 
total contract charges decreased in compared to due to the prospective reporting reclassification of certain ceded reinsurance premiums 
excluding the impact of this reclassification  total contract charges increased in due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life insurance policies resulting from increased contract charge rates and growth in business in force  partially offset by decreased contract charges on fixed annuities resulting primarily from lower contract surrenders

the increase in contract charges on fixed annuities was mostly attributable to higher contract surrenders

contractholder funds decreased and in and  respectively  and increased in average contractholder funds decreased in compared to  and increased in compared to contractholder deposits increased in compared to due primarily to higher deposits on institutional products  and to a lesser extent  higher deposits on fixed annuities and allstate bank products 
sales of our institutional products vary from period to period based on management s assessment of market conditions  investor demand and operational priorities 
deposits on fixed annuities increased in compared to due primarily to increased consumer demand as the attractiveness of fixed annuities relative to competing products improved  partially offset by pricing decisions aimed to increase new business returns 
contractholder deposits decreased in compared to this decline was primarily due to lower deposits on fixed annuities partially offset by higher deposits on institutional products

surrenders and partial withdrawals decreased to billion in from billion in due to lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on market value adjusted annuities and traditional fixed annuities  partially offset by higher surrenders and partial withdrawals on interest sensitive life insurance products and  to a lesser extent  increased withdrawals on allstate bank products 
the surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities  interest sensitive life insurance products and allstate bank products  based on the beginning of period contractholder funds  was in compared to in surrenders and partial withdrawals decreased in compared to this decline was due to lower surrenders and partial withdrawals on interest sensitive life insurance policies and the classification of the net change in variable annuity contractholder funds as other adjustments subsequent to the effective date of our reinsurance agreements with prudential 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in surrenders and partial withdrawals on fixed annuities

the surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities  interest sensitive life insurance products and allstate bank products  based on the beginning of period contractholder funds  was in compared to in the improvement in the surrender and partial withdrawal rate in compared to was primarily due to a block of corporate owned life insurance policies that terminated in due to the bankruptcy of the policyholder 
net investment income decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the decline in was primarily due to lower investment yields on floating rate securities  increased short term investment balances reflecting liquidity management activities  lower average investment balances and lower income from limited partnership interests

analysis of costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased or million in compared to due to lower interest credited to contractholder funds  partially offset by higher amortization of dac  contract benefits and operating costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses in were consistent with as increased interest credited to contractholder funds and life and annuity contract benefits were offset by lower amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  and restructuring and related charges 
life and annuity contract benefits increased or million in compared to due primarily to higher contract benefits on life insurance products  partially offset by lower contract benefits on annuities 
the increase in contract benefits on life insurance products was primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience  partially offset by the recognition in the prior year period of litigation related costs in the form of additional policy benefits 
the decline in contract benefits on annuities was due to the impact of lower sales of immediate annuities with life contingencies  partially offset by unfavorable mortality experience 
life and annuity contract benefits increased or million in compared to due to increased contract benefits on life insurance products  partially offset by lower contract benefits on annuities 
increased contract benefits on life insurance products in were primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience  litigation related costs recognized in in the form of additional policy benefits on certain universal life policies written prior to  and higher contract benefits associated with the workplace division 
the decline in contract benefits on annuities was mostly attributable to favorable mortality experience on immediate annuities with life contingencies and the absence in of contract benefits on the reinsured variable annuity business  partially offset by an increase in the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies 
we analyze our mortality and morbidity results using the difference between premiums and contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and life and annuity contract benefits excluding the portion related to the implied interest on immediate annuities with life contingencies benefit spread 
this implied interest totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the benefit spread by product group is disclosed in the following table

the increase of million in was due primarily to amortization acceleration relating to changes in assumptions and additional amortization recorded in connection with a premium deficiency assessment for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  partially offset by higher accretion of dac relating to net realized capital losses 
the impact of realized capital gains and losses on amortization of dac is dependent upon the relationship between the assets that give rise to the gain or loss and the product liability supported by the assets 
fluctuations result from changes in the impact of realized capital gains and losses on actual and expected gross profits 
in  dac amortization acceleration for changes in assumptions  recorded in connection with comprehensive reviews of the dac balances and assumptions for interest sensitive life insurance  annuities and other investment contracts  resulted in an increase to amortization of dac of million 
the evaluations covered assumptions for investment returns  including capital gains and losses  interest crediting rates to policyholders  the effect of any hedges  persistency  mortality and expenses in all product lines 
the principle assumption impacting the amortization acceleration in was the level of realized capital losses impacting actual gross profits in and the impact of realized capital losses on egp in during the fourth quarter of  our assumptions for egp were impacted by a view of further anticipated impairments in our investment portfolio

during  indicators emerged that suggested a study of mortality experience for our immediate annuities with life contingences was warranted 
at the same time  the underlying profitability of the traditional life business deteriorated due to lower investment returns and growth 
for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  an aggregate premium deficiency of million  pre tax  resulted primarily from the experience study indicating that the annuitants on certain life contingent contracts are projected to live longer than we anticipated when the contracts were issued and  to a lesser degree  a reduction in the related investment portfolio yield 
the deficiency was recorded through a reduction in dac 
there was no similar charge to income recorded in or the decrease in amortization of dac in compared to was due to the absence in of amortization on the reinsured variable annuity business 
excluding amortization relating to the reinsured variable annuity business  amortization of dac in was consistent with as increased amortization related to higher gross profits on fixed annuities and a decline in the credit to income for amortization relating to realized capital gains and losses were partially offset by lower amortization related to interest sensitive life insurance contracts and a favorable impact relating to dac unlocking 
the decline in amortization related to interest sensitive life insurance contracts was the result of a write down in totaling million for the present value of future profits related to a block of corporate owned life insurance policies that terminated due to the bankruptcy of the policyholder

the million in the traditional life and other line was recorded in connection with a premium deficiency assessment for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies and was primarily due to revised annuity mortality assumptions 
the effect of unrealized capital gains and losses represents the amount by which the amortization of dac would increase or decrease if the unrealized capital gains and losses in the respective product portfolios were realized 
recapitalization of dac is limited to the originally deferred policy acquisition costs plus interest 
the adoption of statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop  resulted in an adjustment to unamortized dac related to the impact on future estimated gross profits from the changes in accounting for certain costs associated with contract continuations that no longer qualify for deferral under sop the adjustment was recorded as a million reduction of retained income at january  and a reduction of the dac balance of million  pre tax

during  the financial strength rating of the scottish re group was downgraded by s p to ccc from bb as of december  due to the deterioration of the scottish re group s financial position and liquidity 
the scottish re group s financial strength rating was further downgraded by s p in january to ccc 
the financial strength ratings of the other of allstate financial s reinsurers remain stable 
although a significant impact has not been observed  the unprecedented deterioration in the global financial markets in could impact the financial condition of reinsurers in a variety of ways  including the decline in value of assets held as capital resources or to meet technical provisions  increases in risk based economic or regulatory capital requirements and shortage of available capital in the event that recapitalization is required following a major claim 
we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
no amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended december  we enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the allstate financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities 
these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
allstate financial outlook we will continue to focus on improving returns and reducing our concentration in spread based products  primarily fixed annuities and institutional markets products  resulting in lower premiums and deposits and reductions in net contractholder obligations 
we plan to improve efficiency and narrow the focus of product offerings to better serve the needs of everyday americans 
we are targeting savings at of certain operating expenses  excluding acquisition costs  and expect to yield estimated annual savings of million beginning in we anticipate a reduction of approximately  workforce positions  through a combination of attrition and position elimination over the next two years 
maintaining high liquidity in our investment portfolio will result in lower net investment income but will ensure our ability to meet contractholder obligations 
we will target sales of our spread based products at levels that allow us to avoid sales of investments with significant unrealized losses into distressed or illiquid markets 
we expect continued investment spread compression due to credit losses  reduced contractholder funds and maintenance of liquidity 
investments overview and strategy an important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios 
investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
while taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate  we manage the underlying portfolios based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
the global economy is under significant stress and financial markets continue to experience extreme levels of volatility 
our strategy in will focus primarily upon mitigating the risks from a potential increase in risk free interest rates  reducing exposure to certain investment sectors  and maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital 
in order to achieve this  we expect to use a combination of reinvestment of the portfolio s significant cash flows  derivatives and other portfolio actions 
the property liability portfolio s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
this approach  which has produced competitive returns over the long term  is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
we employ a strategic asset allocation approach  which uses models that consider the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk and return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest 
the recommended asset allocation is informed by our economic and market outlook  as well as other inputs and constraints  including duration  liquidity and capital considerations 
the allstate financial portfolio s investment strategy focuses on the total return of assets needed to support the underlying liabilities to achieve return on capital and profitable growth 
the portfolio management process begins with a strategic asset allocation model which considers the nature and risk tolerances of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk and return parameters  of the various asset classes in which we invest 
this approach is informed by our economic and market outlook  as well as other inputs and constraints including duration  liquidity and capital preservation 
within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
the corporate and other portfolio s investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio relative to the overall corporate capital structure 
the portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns 
as a result of decisions in managing each of the portfolios  we may sell securities during a period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
for more information  see the net realized capital gains and losses section of the md a 
during  we developed risk mitigation and return optimization programs as our outlook on the economy changed significantly as conditions deteriorated throughout the year 
the risk mitigation and return optimization programs augment earlier actions to reduce investments in real estate and other market sectors as well as to mitigate exposures to risk free interest rate spikes 
at the end of the second quarter of  we had an outlook for continued weakness in the global financial markets and economy including continued volatility in the financial markets  reduced liquidity in certain asset classes and unfavorable economic trends 
during the third quarter of  we significantly modified our outlook to a more severe and prolonged downturn 
we continue to expect extreme levels of volatility in the financial markets  suppressed liquidity in certain asset classes and further unfavorable global economic conditions 
in addition  the potential for market supply and demand imbalances has remained above normal due to the deteriorating credit strength of financial institutions and eroding investor confidence 
among our risk mitigation and return optimization activities  we have taken the following actions developed and maintained a tactical positioning in liquid assets and assets that we can sell without generating significant additional realized capital losses 
continued to reduce exposure in assets other than those for which we have asserted an intent to hold until recovery where we have credit concerns or where there has been a significant change in facts and circumstances 
decreased exposure to financial related market sectors to billion as of december  from billion as of december   primarily as a result of targeted sales and declines in fair value 
also reduced our short term investing in financial institutions 
decreased exposure to residential and commercial real estate market sectors to billion as of december  from billion as of december  as a result of targeted sales  principal payments and declines in fair value 
reduced overall counterparty exposure replacing over the counter otc derivatives transactions used as stock market hedges with exchange traded instruments where available 
in the second half of  we sold billion of government securities and recognized realized capital gains of million 
generated losses as part of tax planning strategy primarily within our equity portfolios that are effectively carried on a lower of cost or fair value basis to realize capital loss carryback benefits 
investments for which we had changed our intent to hold to recovery as of june  totaled billion and included billion as part of the risk mitigation and return optimization programs  billion of securities as part of our enterprise wide asset allocation program and million related to individual securities 
a risk mitigation and return optimization program  approved as of the end of the second quarter of  was designed to reduce our exposure to residential and commercial real estate and the financial related market sector by approximately billion of amortized cost  prior to change in intent write downs 
a comprehensive review identified specific investments that could be significantly impacted by continued deterioration in the economy that may be sold 
this included a portion of our residential and commercial real estate securities including securities collateralized by residential and commercial mortgage loans  mortgage loans and securities issued by financial institutions 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we sold billion of these securities 
on october   it was determined that  due to the financial markets experiencing additional severe deterioration and disruptions  we would be unable to sell certain of the investments identified as part of the programs at a value equal to or greater than our view of their intrinsic values 
approximately billion of these investments were re designated as intent to hold to recovery 
investments for which we had changed our intent to hold to recovery totaled million as of december  for a more detailed discussion on securities written down due to a change in intent  see the net realized capital gains and losses section of the md a 
as part of the risk mitigation and return optimization programs  hedges were implemented to mitigate portfolio interest rate risk  credit spread risk  and equity market valuation declines 
the equity hedge was designed to protect the equity portfolio from significant equity market valuation declines below targeted levels 
the strategy employed equity indexed options which generated realized gains in the third and fourth quarters of at december   we had billion of notional protection with an average strike price that was below equity market levels 
the interest rate component was put in place to protect a certain portion of fixed income securities if interest rates increase above a targeted maximum level 
interest rate spike protection for our fixed income portfolio in the amount of billion of notional principal protection was in place at december  of this total  billion was executed in early and billion executed in december the billion of protection was initially struck at basis points out of the money  but  due to declining interest rates  at december  is struck over basis points out of the money 
the billion of protection executed in december was initially struck at approximately basis points out of the money 
other aspects of the hedging program have been designed to mitigate municipal bond interest rate risk and credit spread risk 
the effectiveness of these hedges may be reduced due to the basis risk associated with these strategies 
we continue to monitor the progress of these actions as market and economic conditions develop and will adapt our strategies as appropriate 
our continuing focus is to manage our risks and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate further adverse effects 
investments outlook continuing risk mitigation efforts will focus on shortening duration of the fixed income portfolio  reducing exposures to real estate and certain other market sectors  and managing excess market volatility through our macro hedging programs 
net investment income will decline due to lower asset balances and yields  and the costs of maintaining high liquidity and the risk mitigation programs 
our portfolio continues to generate significant cash flow from maturities  principal and interest receipts which will be available to manage liabilities and take advantage of market opportunities

the corporate and other investment portfolio decreased to billion at december   from billion at december   primarily due to cash flows used in financing activities and a billion capital contribution to aic 
total investments at amortized cost related to collateral received in connection with securities lending business activities and collateral posted by counterparties related to derivative transactions decreased to million at december   from billion at december  as of december   these investments are included as a component of short term investments 
at december   these investments were carried at fair value and billion were classified in fixed income securities and million were classified in short term investments 
securities lending activities are primarily used as an investment yield enhancement  and are conducted with third parties such as brokerage firms 
we obtain collateral  typically in the form of cash  in an amount generally equal to to of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities  respectively  and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary 
the cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments  and an offsetting liability to return the collateral is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expenses 
we obtain fair values of our fixed income and equity securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts from several sources and methods 
for a discussion of these sources and methods  see the application of critical accounting estimates section of the md a 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments to help manage the exposure to interest rate risk  and to a lesser extent currency and credit risks  from the fixed income securities portfolio as well as exposure to equity price risk from the equity securities portfolio

due to lags between the funding of an investment  execution of final legal documents  filing with the securities valuation office svo of the naic  and rating by the svo  we generally have a small number of securities that have a pending naic rating 
municipal bonds  including tax exempt and taxable securities  totaled billion at december  the following table summarizes the municipal bond portfolio by moody s equivalent rating as of december  tax exempt in millions par value amortized cost fair value unrealized gain loss fair value as a percent of amortized cost non zero coupon rating aaa aa a baa ba or lower total zero coupon rating aaa aa a baa total total tax exempt taxable in millions par value amortized cost fair value unrealized gain loss fair value as a percent of amortized cost non zero coupon rating aaa aa a baa ba or lower total taxable in millions par value amortized cost fair value unrealized gain loss fair value as a percent of amortized cost zero coupon rating aaa aa a baa total total taxable total in millions par value amortized cost fair value unrealized gain loss fair value as a percent of amortized cost rating aaa aa a baa ba or lower total includes ars securities with par value of billion  amortized cost of billion  fair value of billion and unrealized gains losses of million 
moody s equivalent rating will not necessarily tie to ratings distributions from the naic due to potential timing differences between the various rating suppliers and the number of external rating agencies used in the determination 
the unrealized net capital loss of billion at december  in our municipal bond portfolio was mainly caused by widening credit spreads that affected three main areas in this portfolio tax exempt a and baa rated holdings contributing million of the unrealized losses and taxable zero coupon holdings contributing million of the unrealized losses  but particularly our less liquid zero coupon and longer dated securities  high yield municipal bond portfolio contributing million of the unrealized losses  and student loan ars contributing million of the unrealized losses 
included in our municipal bond portfolio at december  are billion of ars that have long term stated maturities  with the interest rate reset based on auctions that generally occur every  or days depending on the specific security 
this is compared to a balance of ars at december  of billion  with the decline primarily representing redemptions from calls or refunding proceeds since december  our holdings primarily have a moody s equivalent rating of aaa 
approximately billion of our holdings are pools of student loans for which at least of the collateral was insured by the us department of education at the time we purchased the security 
as of december   billion of our ars backed by student loans was insured by the us department of education  million was to insured and million was to insured 
all of our student loan ars holdings are experiencing failed auctions and we receive the failed auction rate or  for those which contain maximum reset rate formulas  we received the contractual maximum rate 
we anticipate that failed auctions may persist and most of our holdings will continue to pay the failed auction rate or  for those that contain maximum rate reset formulas  the maximum rate  as described below 
auctions continue to be conducted as scheduled for each of the securities 
we estimate that approximately one third of our student loan backed ars include maximum rate reset formulas with a look back feature whereby if the failed auction rate exceeds an annual contractual maximum rate over a preceding stipulated period  the coupon interest rate is temporarily reset to the maximum rate  which can vary between zero and the failed auction rate 
this maximum rate formula causes the reset interest rate on these securities to be lower than the failed auction rate in order to reduce the annual interest rate so that it does not exceed the annual contractual maximum rate 
generally  the annual contractual maximum rate is higher than the historical rates paid on these securities 
at december   interest on million of our ars has reset using the maximum rate reset formula 
also included in our municipal bond holdings at december  are million of municipal securities which are not rated by third party credit rating agencies  but are rated by the naic and also internally rated by us 
these holdings mainly comprise the high yield portion of our overall municipal bond portfolio and provide the opportunity to achieve incremental returns and enhanced diversification of our overall investments portfolio 
our initial investment decisions and ongoing monitoring procedures for these securities are based on a thorough due diligence process that includes  among other things  an assessment of the credit  structure  and liquidity risks of the issue and issuer 
corporate bonds totaled billion at december  as of december   billion  or of the portfolio consisted of privately placed securities compared to billion or at december  privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are in unregistered form and are directly negotiated with the borrower 
all privately placed corporate securities are rated by the naic based on information provided to them and are also internally rated 
additionally  approximately of the privately placed corporate securities in our portfolio are rated by an independent rating agency

the unrealized net capital loss of billion at december  is driven primarily by significantly widening credit spreads resulting from deteriorating macro economic conditions and continued credit market deterioration 
credit spread widening particularly affected our non hybrid baa and lower rated corporate bond holdings  contributing to approximately billion of the unrealized net capital loss 
the other significant driver of unrealized net capital losses in our corporate bond portfolio is from hybrid securities  contributing million of the unrealized loss 
while these securities are generally issued by highly rated financial institutions  they have structural features which make them more sensitive to credit market deterioration 
specifically  features allowing coupon deferral and the extension of call dates have severely impacted prices as the global financial system undergoes significant stress

the portfolio is made up of approximately issues with an average security value of approximately million 
privately placed corporate obligations generally benefit from increased yields and structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration  reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities 
additionally  investments in these securities are made after extensive due diligence of the issuer  typically including direct discussions with senior management and on site visits to company facilities 
ongoing monitoring includes direct periodic dialog with senior management of the issuer and continuous monitoring of operating performance and financial position 
every issue is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation approximately once a year

in the absence of further deterioration in the collateral relative to our positions in the securities respective capital structures  which could be other than temporary  the unrealized losses should reverse over the remaining lives of the securities 
the cash flows of the underlying mortgages or collateral for mbs  cmbs including cre cdo and abs are generally applied in a pre determined order and are designed so that each security issued qualifies for a specific original rating 
the security issue is typically referred to as the class 
for example  the senior portion or top of the capital structure which would originally qualify for a rating of aaa is referred to as the aaa class and typically has priority in receiving the principal repayments on the underlying mortgages 
in a sequential structure  underlying collateral principal repayments are directed to the most senior rated aaa class in the structure until paid in full  after which principal repayments are directed to the next most senior aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full 
although the various aaa classes may receive principal sequentially  they may share any losses from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis after losses are absorbed by classes with lower original ratings or what may be referred to as more junior or subordinate securities in the capital structure 
the underlying mortgages have fixed interest rates  variable interest rates such as adjustable rate mortgages arm or are hybrid  meaning that they contain features of both fixed and variable rate mortgages 
mbs totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  the mbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages 
the credit risk associated with our mbs is mitigated due to the fact that of the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by  or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by us government agencies or us government sponsored entities us agency

cmbs totaled billion  with rated investment grade  at december  the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk  but unlike other structured securities  is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates 
approximately of the cmbs investments are structured securities collateralized by pools of commercial mortgages  broadly diversified across property types and geographical area

most senior of the aaa rated tranches  typically has a high level of credit enhancement of approximately  meaning actual losses in the deal have to reach before incurring a first dollar loss 
middle aaa rated tranche  typically having credit enhancement of approximately  are subordinate only to the super senior bonds 
lowest aaa rated tranche  typically with credit enhancement in the low teens 
this bond is subordinate to the super senior and mezzanine senior tranches  but still senior to all tranches rated below aaa 
includes aaa bonds that were originated in through that do not fall into the categories above 
these are non traditional cmbs bonds large loan pools  single borrower transactions that did not have a aaa senior type breakdown 
prior to  the aaa bonds in a transaction were generally not divided into super senior  mezzanine senior  or subordinated senior with the exception of a few deals structured very late in  therefore all and prior aaa rated securities are grouped into this category 
the unrealized net capital loss of billion at december  on our cmbs portfolio was a result of significant widening of credit spreads due to deteriorating macro economic conditions and continued credit market deterioration 
credit spread widening occurred in all rating classes but was particularly evident in our subordinated senior aaa  pre aaa rated and lower rated securities 
these holdings accounted for billion  or approximately of the unrealized net capital loss 
our analysis suggests that the vast majority of our cmbs portfolio is well insulated from a severe rise in commercial mortgage default rates 
credit protections in the portfolio  including those on subordinated senior aaa and aa rated securities  are multiples of historic high commercial mortgage loss experience and well in excess of our current loss expectations 
cre cdo are structured securities secured primarily by cmbs and other commercial mortgage debt obligations

in addition  many of the securities in the abs portfolio are credit enhanced with features such as over collateralization  subordinated structures  reserve funds  guarantees and or insurance 
a portion of the abs portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since ultimate realized yields are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying assets 
abs rmbs includes securities that are collateralized by mortgage loans issued to borrowers that cannot qualify for prime or alt a financing terms due in part to weak or limited credit history

the underlying collateral for our trust preferred cdo portfolio is not actively managed and is diversified by issuer  predominately regional banks  with a small percentage of insurance companies 
market value cdo are structurally similar to cash flow clo 
the primary difference is that the market value of the underlying assets is managed in order to enhance returns and the structure is governed by market value based tests 
the managers are also offered more flexibility to purchase other asset types including secured leveraged loans  public and private high yield bonds  structured products  mezzanine investments  and equities 
project finance cdo underlying assets are primarily below investment grade senior secured project finance loans and energy finance investments

additionally  we hold million of corporate bonds and million in credit default swaps that were directly issued by these bond insurers 
of our municipal bond portfolio is insured by nine bond insurers and of these securities have a moody s equivalent rating of aaa or aa 
our practices for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds primarily are based on the quality of the primary obligor 
as of december   we believe the valuations already reflected a decline in the value of the insurance  and further related declines if any  are not expected to be material 
while the valuation of these holdings may be temporarily impacted by negative and rapidly changing market developments  we continue to have the intent and ability to hold the bonds and expect to receive all of the contractual cash flows

and by financial guarantee insurance company 
credit ratings without the insurance guarantee are not available in certain cases where the issuer does not solicit the rating agency to provide the rating without the insurance guarantee and  as a result  the rating agency does not disclose it 
the ratings of our holdings with insurance guarantee generally follow the rating of the bond insurer 
in cases where the rating of the bond insurer is lower than that of the underlying security  the rating without insurance guarantee could be higher than that with the guarantee

gross unrealized gains totaled million at december  compared to billion at december  gross unrealized losses totaled million at december  compared to million at december  at december   equity securities included million effectively carried on a lower of cost or fair value basis due to the nature of the investment management style employed 
there were no equity securities effectively carried on a lower of cost or fair value as of december  mortgage loans our mortgage loan portfolio  which is primarily held in the allstate financial portfolio  was billion and billion at december  and  respectively  and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate 
geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our exposure 
the portfolio is diversified across several property types 
our largest exposure to any metropolitan area is also highly diversified  with the largest exposure not exceeding of the portfolio 
the average debt service coverage ratio represents the amount of cash flows available by the borrower to meet its principal and interest payment obligations 
the average debt service coverage ratio of the portfolio as of december  was approximately  and only approximately of the mortgage loan portfolio had a debt service coverage ratio under we closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance  as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risks  are reviewed at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status as necessary 
the underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by a market based expected rate of return 
we had million of realized capital losses related to valuation allowances on mortgage loans for the year ended december  and had no realized capital losses related to valuation allowances on mortgage loans for the year ended december  additionally  realized capital losses due to changes in intent to hold mortgage loans to maturity totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

further  income on ema lp is recognized on a delay due to the availability of the related financial statements 
the recognition of income on hedge funds is primarily on a one month delay and the income recognition on private equity debt funds and real estate funds are generally on a three month delay as of december  as such  the income recognized through december  for ema lp may not include the full impact for calendar year investment market changes as they will ultimately impact the valuation of the underlying assets or liabilities within the partnerships 
limited partnership interests accounted for under the cost method of accounting recognize income only upon cash distributions by the partnership 
short term investments our short term investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the increase in short term investments was primarily due to liquidity management actions 
we invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year 
other investments our other investments as of december  are comprised primarily of billion of bank loans  billion of policy loans and million of certain derivatives  including credit default swaps 
bank loans are comprised primarily of senior secured corporate loans and are carried at amortized cost 
policy loans are carried at the unpaid principal balances 
credit default swaps cds are utilized for both buying and selling credit protection against a specified credit event 
in selling protection  cds are used to replicate fixed income securities and to complement the cash market when credit exposure to certain issuers is not available or when the derivative alternative is less expensive than the cash market alternative 
we are not selling protection to acquire revenues as a business activity 
when buying protection  the objective is to mitigate credit risk on fixed income holdings in our portfolio 
credit risk includes both default risk and market value exposure due to spread widening 
cds typically have a five year term

in buying and selling protection cds  we buy or sell credit protection on an identified single name  a basket of names in a first to default ftd structure or credit derivative index cdx that is generally investment grade  and in return pay or receive periodic premiums through expiration or termination of the agreement 
with single name cds  the premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the referenced name s public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates  at the time the agreement is executed 
with ftd baskets  because of the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named credits  the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the basket and correlation between the names 
cdx index is utilized to take a position on multiple generally credit entities 
credit events are typically defined as bankruptcy  failure to pay  or restructuring  depending on the nature of the reference credit 
if a credit event occurs  we settle with the counterparty  either through physical settlement or cash settlement 
in a physical settlement  a reference asset is delivered by the buyer of protection to the seller of protection  in exchange for cash payment at par  while in a cash settlement  the seller pays the difference between par and the prescribed value of the reference asset 
when such an event occurs in a single name or ftd basket for ftd  the first such event occurring for any one name in the basket  the contract terminates at time of settlement 
for cdx index  the reference entity s name incurring the credit event is removed from the index while the contract continues until expiration 
the maximum payout on a cds is the contract notional amount 
for all cds  once a credit event and settlement has occurred  there may be subsequent recoveries 
recovery amounts  if any  vary and they may reduce the ultimate amount of net gain or loss

although we evaluate premium deficiencies on the combined performance of our life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies  the adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies  in addition to annuity buy outs and certain payout annuities with life contingencies 
the dac and dsi adjustment represents the amount by which the amortization of dac and dsi would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized 
recapitalization of the dac and dsi balances is limited to the originally deferred costs plus interest

credit spreads are the additional yield on fixed income securities above the risk free rate typically defined as the yield on us treasury securities that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit  liquidity and or prepayment risks for fixed income securities with consistent terms 
credit spreads vary with the market s perception of risk and liquidity in a specific issuer or specific sectors 
credit spreads can widen increase or tighten decrease and may offset or add to the effects of risk free interest rate changes in the valuation of fixed income securities from period to period

all securities in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value are other than temporary 
portfolio monitoring we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate  on a case by case basis  fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
the process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify situations where the fair value  compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities and cost for equity securities  is below established thresholds for certain time periods  or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings  ratings downgrades or payment defaults 
the securities identified  in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern  are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list 
all investments in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process for determining whether declines in value were other than temporary 
we also conduct a portfolio review to recognize impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery as a result of approved programs involving the disposition of investments for reasons such as negative developments that would change the view of long term investors and their intent to continue to hold the investment  subsequent credit deterioration of an issuer or holding  subsequent further deterioration of capital markets ie debt and equity and of economic conditions  subsequent further deterioration in the financial services and real estate industries  changes in duration  revisions to strategic asset allocations  liquidity needs  unanticipated federal income tax situations involving capital gains and capital loss carrybacks and carryforwards with specific expiration dates  investment risk mitigation actions  and other new facts and circumstances that would cause a change in our previous intent to hold a security to recovery or maturity

the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired 
categories iii and iv have primarily been historically adversely affected by industry and issue specific  or issuer specific conditions

of the unrealized losses on below investment grade securities  were in significant unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to of amortized cost for six or more consecutive months prior to december  included among the securities rated below investment grade are high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired 
we mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities  through diversification of the portfolio  active credit monitoring and portfolio management activities 
we continue to believe that the unrealized losses on these securities are not predictive of the ultimate performance

sales net realized losses in were due to net realized losses on equity securities of million comprised of gross losses of billion and gross gains of million 
the gross losses primarily resulted from the execution of tax planning strategies primarily within our equity portfolios that are effectively carried on a lower of cost or fair value basis to realize capital loss carryback benefits 
the net realized gains on sales in were primarily due to net realized gains on equity securities of billion comprised of gross gains of billion and gross losses of million 
the gross gains were attributable to our continuing tactical reallocation of equity securities in the property liability portfolio 
the ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended december  totaled million and ranged from million to million 
five securities totaling million were in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of less than six consecutive months 
one security totaling million was in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of more than six but less than twelve consecutive months

the circumstances of the above losses are considered to be security or issue specific and are not expected to have a material effect on other holdings in our portfolios 
we may sell or change our intent to hold a security until recovery for impaired fixed income or equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position at the previous reporting date  or other investments where the fair value has declined below the amortized cost or cost  in situations where significant unanticipated new facts and circumstances emerge or existing facts and circumstances increase in significance and are anticipated to adversely impact a security s future valuations more than previously expected  including negative developments that would change the view of long term investors and their intent to continue to hold the investment  subsequent credit deterioration of an issuer or holding  subsequent further deterioration in capital markets ie debt and equity and of economic conditions  subsequent further deterioration in the financial services and real estate industries  liquidity needs  unanticipated federal income tax situations involving capital gains and capital loss carrybacks and carryforwards with specific expiration dates  investment risk mitigation actions  and other new facts and circumstances that would cause a change in our previous intent to hold a security to recovery or maturity 
upon approval of programs involving the expected disposition of investments  portfolio managers identify a population of suitable investments  typically larger than needed to accomplish the objective  from which specific securities are selected to sell 
due to our change in intent to hold until recovery  we recognize impairments on investments within the population that are in an unrealized loss position 
further unrealized loss positions that develop subsequent to the original write down are recognized in the reporting period in which they occur through the date the program is closed 
the program is closed when the objectives of the program are accomplished or a decision is made not to fully complete it  at which time an evaluation is performed of any remaining securities and where appropriate they are redesignated as having the intent to hold to recovery 
reasons resulting in a decision not to complete an approved program include matters such as the mitigation of concerns that led to the initial decision  changes in priorities or new complications that emerge from significant unanticipated developments  such as subsequent significant deterioration which we view to be temporary in nature  to the point at which securities could only be sold at prices below our view of their intrinsic values  or subsequent favorable developments that support a return to having the intent to hold to recovery 
subsequent other than temporary impairment evaluations utilize the amortized cost or cost basis that reflect the write downs 
fixed income securities subject to change in intent write downs  including those redesignated as intent to hold  continue to earn investment income and any discount or premium from the amortized cost basis that reflects the write downs is recognized using the effective yield method over the expected life of the security 
as previously described above  it is not possible to reliably identify a reasonably likely circumstance that would result in a change in intent to hold securities to recovery leading to the reporting of additional realized capital losses  since they result from significant unanticipated changes

includes change in intent write downs of million and million in the third and fourth quarter of  respectively  and impairment write downs of million and million in the third and fourth quarter of  respectively 
our original objective in our june  risk mitigation and return optimization program was to reduce our exposure to the identified investments in an orderly fashion prior to additional significant negative impacts 
though we were able to complete a considerable portion of the reduction  approximately billion of this program  during the third and fourth quarters of the financial markets experienced additional and severe dislocation 
a series of events  which includes the effects of failures of large financial institutions and intermediaries and various intervention by the government  significantly increased the level of uncertainty in the market 
these conditions drove significant volatility in the levels of liquidity and put additional and immediate downward pressures on prices of certain of these investments in respect to our estimated intrinsic values 
as a result of these market conditions  which have worsened  we determined that we would not be able to sell certain of these investments at our view of their intrinsic values 
investments re designated at october  as having the intent to hold to recovery due to our inability to dispose of them for values equal to or greater than our view of their intrinsic value are presented in the following table

for the year ended december   we recognized million of losses related to a change in our intent to hold certain investments with unrealized losses in the property liability and allstate financial segments until they recover in value 
the change in our intent was primarily related to strategic asset allocation decisions and ongoing comprehensive reviews of our portfolios as well as a liquidity strategy in the property liability portfolio

in the event the economic value of the options is not realized  we will recover the par value if held to maturity unless the issuer of the note defaults 
total par value exceeded fair value by million at december  losses on derivatives used for interest rate risk management but which have not been designated as accounting hedges  primarily in our duration management programs  were related to changing interest rates and  to a lesser extent  widening credit spreads 
gains from the risk reduction programs  primarily in our equity hedge program  were related to declines in the fair value of s p related securities and losses were experienced in our income generation programs and from the valuation changes of embedded options in fixed income securities 
a changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level 
a duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term investment portfolio view 
tactical duration management is accomplished through both cash market transactions including new purchases and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses 
as a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration  realized gains and losses on certain derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio 
this approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the company

the short interest rate future contracts are exchange traded  daily cash settled and can be exited at any time for minimal additional cost 
the year to date ytd settlement loss on futures resulted from decreases in risk free interest rates 
unrealized gains on the fixed income portfolio caused by decreasing interest rates did not offset settlement losses due to widening credit spreads 
the municipal interest rate swaps can be terminated at any time for minimal additional cost 
periodic settlements occur quarterly 
the ytd valuation gain represents the changing value of expected future settlements and resulted from increases in the municipal interest rates 
unrealized losses on the municipal fixed income portfolio  caused by widening credit spreads  more than offset the valuation gains on the derivative 
interest rate spike exposure interest rate swaption contracts  with approximately one year terms  and exchange traded options on treasury futures provide an offset to declining fixed income market values resulting from potential rising interest rates

the maximum loss on caps and floors would be limited to the amount of premium paid for the protection 
the change in valuation reflects the changing value of expected future settlements from changing interest rates  which may vary over the period of the contracts 
the ytd losses  resulting from decreasing interest rates  are offset in unrealized gains in oci to the extent it relates to changes in risk free rates  however  the impact of widening credit spreads more than offset this benefit

adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market or market segment  insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and or risk tolerance 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices  although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the character of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and controls over risk management activities 
subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees 
for allstate financial  its asset liability management alm policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks 
alm focuses on strategies to enhance yields  mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for allstate financial 
allstate financial alm activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these alm policies specify limits  ranges and or targets for investments that best meet allstate financial s business objectives in light of its product liabilities 
we manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration and value at risk limits  simulation  and as appropriate  through the use of stress tests 
we have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
we have duration limits on the property liability and allstate financial investment portfolios and  as appropriate  on individual components of these portfolios 
these duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income  equity  and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
for allstate financial  this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the alm organization 
this integration is intended to result in a prudent  methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return  conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of allstate financial s product liabilities and supported by the continuous application of advanced risk technology and analytics 
although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issue interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in us treasury yields and other key risk free reference yields 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset with a duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
at december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately  compared to a gap at december  a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities 
most of our duration gap is attributable to the property liability operations  with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims 
in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
this objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the property liability assets and liabilities 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable spreads across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities within predetermined tolerance levels 
this philosophy is executed using duration targets for fixed income investments in addition to interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps  floors and swaptions to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
we pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts 
for futures and option contracts traded on exchanges  we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling million as of december  for otc derivative transactions including interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors  and credit default swaps  master netting agreements are used 
these agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements and  when applicable  we are required to post collateral 
as of december   we held cash of million and did not have any securities pledged by counterparties as collateral for otc instruments  we pledged cash of million and securities of million as collateral to counterparties 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on otc derivative collateral requirements by assuming a hypothetical reduction in our s p s insurance financial strength ratings from aa to a and a basis point decline in interest rates 
the analysis indicated that we would have to post an estimated million in additional collateral with approximately attributable to allstate financial 
the selection of these hypothetical scenarios should not be construed as our prediction of future events  but only as an illustration of the estimated potential effect of such events 
we also actively manage our counterparty credit risk exposure by monitoring the level of collateral posted by our counterparties with respect to our receivable positions 
to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability claims and claims expense reserves  annuity liabilities and other interest sensitive liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
the preceding assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
based upon the information and assumptions used in the duration calculation  and interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately million  compared to billion at december  reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses options on treasury futures to manage the property liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets  as well as a program that uses interest rate swaptions to manage the risk of a large rate increase 
in calculating the impact of a basis point increase on the value of the derivatives  we have assumed interest rate volatility remains constant 
based on the option on treasury futures and swaption contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
there are billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments 
these assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate 
the billion of assets excluded from the calculation has decreased from the billion reported at december  due to capital market changes 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
credit spread risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads spreads 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in spread sensitive fixed income assets 
we manage the spread risk in our assets 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is spread duration 
spread duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to changes in spreads 
for example  if spreads increase basis points  the fair value of an asset exhibiting a spread duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
spread duration is calculated similarly to interest rate duration 
at december   the spread duration of property liability assets was and the spread duration of allstate financial assets was 
based upon the information and assumptions we use in this spread duration calculation  and spreads in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in spreads across all asset classes  industry sectors and credit ratings spread shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets by approximately billion  compared to billion at december  reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of our risk mitigation actions that use credit default swaps to manage spread risk 
based on contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel spread increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel spread decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in spreads should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   we held approximately billion in common stocks and exchange traded funds etfs  and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily convertible securities  limited partnership interests  non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes  compared to approximately billion and billion  respectively  at december  approximately and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations at december   compared to approximately and  respectively  at december  additionally  we had  contracts in long standard poor s composite price index s p puts at december  with a fair value of million 
at december   our portfolio of common stocks and other securities with equity risk had a cash market portfolio beta of approximately  compared to a beta of approximately at december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  quantitatively  an investment s market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the s p based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p increases or decreases by  the fair value of our equity investments will increase or decrease by approximately  respectively 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at december   including the effect of the s p puts  we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately million  compared to million at december   and an immediate increase in the s p of would increase the net fair value by million compared to million at december  in calculating the impact of a s p index perturbation on the value of the puts  we have assumed index volatility remains constant 
based on the s p index put options in place at december   we would recognize losses totaling million in the event of a increase in the s p index and million in gains in the event of a decrease 
the selection of a immediate decrease in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our common stocks and other securities with equity risk was determined using barra s predictive beta 
this beta is based on a company s fundamental data 
the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if the future composition of the portfolio hence its beta and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
at december  and  we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
equity risk exists for contract charges based on separate account balances and guarantees for death and or income benefits provided by our variable products 
in  we disposed of substantially all of the variable annuity business through a reinsurance agreement with prudential as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and therefore mitigated this aspect of our risk 
equity risk for our variable life business relates to contract charges and policyholder benefits 
total variable life contract charges for and were million and million  respectively 
separate account liabilities related to variable life contracts were million and million in december  and  respectively 
at december  and we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s p we hedge the risk associated with these liabilities using equity indexed options and futures  interest rate swaps  and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments  including real estate funds  and our canadian operations 
we also have certain funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies  however  derivatives are used to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and approximately of the fixed income securities 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign currency denominated equity securities  an additional million net investment in our foreign subsidiaries  and million in unhedged non dollar pay fixed income securities 
these amounts were million  million  and million  respectively  at december  approximately of the foreign currency exposure is in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions we used at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
our currency exposure is diversified across currencies  compared to currencies at december  our largest individual foreign currency exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
the largest individual foreign currency exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
our primary regional exposure is to western europe  approximately at december   compared to at december  the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
commodity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the prices of commodities 
this risk arises from commodity linked investments  such as the goldman sachs commodity index which is a broad based  oil dominated index 
at december  and  we had no exposure to the index 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the pension and other postretirement plans may be amended or terminated at any time 
any revisions could result in significant changes to our obligations and our obligation to fund the plans 
we report unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in the consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
it represents differences between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans that have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost 
the measurement of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost can vary based upon the fluctuations in the fair value of the plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for the plans as discussed below 
the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost at december  was billion  an increase of million from million at december  the increase was the result of declines in the value of plan assets during partially offset by an increased discount rate 
as of december   each of our qualified pension plans had projected benefit obligations that significantly exceeded plan assets 
as of december   each of our us qualified pension plans had projected benefit obligations that slightly exceeded plan assets 
as provided for in the financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan losses and gains on equity securities over a five year period  which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on equity securities on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions  including settlement charges 
this represents a decrease compared to due to the increase in discount rate for each pension plan  which resulted in lower amortization of net actuarial loss 
net periodic pension cost decreased in principally due to lower service cost  higher expected returns on plan assets  and lower amortization of net actuarial loss due to higher plan asset values 
net periodic pension cost decreased in principally due to lower settlement charges and decreases in the amortization of actuarial losses 
in each of the years  and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents and in due to higher lump sum payments made to allstate employees 
additional settlement charges occurred during and also related to the supplemental retirement income plan as a result of lump sum payments made from the plan 
settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents 
amounts recorded for pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
plan assets sustained net losses in current and prior periods primarily due to declines in equity and credit markets 
these asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets in and into the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the barclay corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by s p s or at least aa by moody s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and accumulated other comprehensive income 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income as of our december measurement date  versus an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability as of january   our remeasurement date to transition to a december measurement date under sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 

a hypothetical increase of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost liability of our pension plans recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income by million as of december   versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the net funded status liability as of january  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses  which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in results of operations in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost at december   compared to million at january  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million at december   compared to million at january  we target funding levels that do not restrict the payment of plan benefits in our domestic plans and were within our targeted range as of december  in light of significant market declines occurring at the end of  we expect that contributions of approximately million may be needed for the plan year to maintain the plans funded status 
this estimate could change significantly following either a dramatic improvement or decline in investment markets 
deferred taxes the total deferred tax valuation allowance is million at december  we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is required each reporting period 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed  all available evidence is considered 
this includes the potential for capital and ordinary loss carryback  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences 
with respect to our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset on unrealized losses on fixed income securities  we rely on our assertion that we have the intent and ability to hold the securities to recovery 
as a result  the unrealized losses on these securities would not be expected to materialize and no valuation allowance on the associated deferred tax asset is needed 
with respect to our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance related to other capital losses that have not yet been recognized for tax purposes  we utilize prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these include strategies that optimize the ability to carry back capital losses as well as the ability to offset future capital losses with capital gains that could be recognized for tax purposes 
we have remaining capital loss carryback capacity of billion from included in the million valuation allowance at december  is million relating to the deferred tax asset on capital losses that have not yet been recognized for tax purposes 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources consist of shareholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes our capital resources at december in millions common stock  retained income and other shareholders equity items accumulated other comprehensive income total shareholders equity debt total capital resources ratio of debt to shareholders equity ratio of debt to capital resources shareholders equity decreased in  due to unrealized net capital losses on investments  net loss  share repurchases  dividends paid to shareholders and an increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
shareholders equity increased in  due to net income and a decline in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost  partially offset by share repurchases  decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders 
the decrease to shareholders equity resulting from the increase in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in was the result of unfavorable investment returns partially offset by the effects of higher discount rates 
the change to the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost had an impact on shareholders equity of million unfavorable for pension  and million favorable for other post employment benefits opeb 
for further information on the impact to unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
the decline in the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost in was primarily related to favorable investment performance of the assets and an increase in the discount rate of the pension plans  and lower than assumed claims experience in the other postretirement employee benefit plans 
the favorable change to the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit cost had an impact on shareholders equity of million for pension  and million for opeb 
share repurchases we suspended our billion share repurchase program in october and do not plan to complete it by the target date of march  the number of shares repurchased under the program was million shares for billion for the year ended december  since  we have acquired million shares of our common stock at a cost of billion  primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs 
we have reissued million shares since  primarily associated with our equity incentive plans  the acquisition of american heritage life investment corporation and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
the impact of our repurchase programs on total shares outstanding since has been a net reduction of million shares or 
debt increased million in compared to and million in compared to due to increases in long term debt 
the million of senior notes due are scheduled to mature on december  these senior notes are expected to be refinanced

at december  and  there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings 
financial ratings and strength the following table summarizes our debt  commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings 
moody s standard poor s am best the allstate corporation senior long term debt a a a the allstate corporation commercial paper p a amb aic insurance financial strength aa aa a allstate life insurance company insurance financial strength a aa a our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance  asset quality  liquidity  asset liability management  overall portfolio mix  financial leverage ie  debt  exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage 
on february   am best affirmed the allstate corporation s debt rating of a as well as the a financial strength ratings of aic and alic

in october  moody s downgraded the allstate corporation to a from a and the financial strength ratings of alic to aa from aa we have distinct and separately capitalized groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance in new jersey and florida that maintain separate group ratings 
the ratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate specifically to each group 
many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a secure financial strength rating from an accredited rating agency 
allstate new jersey insurance company and encompass insurance company of new jersey  which write auto and homeowners insurance  are rated a by am best 
allstate new jersey insurance company also has a demotech rating of a 
on october   am best placed the allstate corporation s subsidiary in florida  allstate floridian  under review with negative implications based upon the uncertainty regarding the fhcf s ability to fund its reimbursement obligations 
however  as no catastrophes occurred through the end of the season  am best removed allstate floridian from review and placed it on negative outlook while affirming its rating of b 
effective may   alic  aic and the corporation entered into a one year amended and restated intercompany liquidity agreement liquidity agreement replacing the intercompany liquidity agreement between alic and aic  dated january  the agreement allows for short term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes 
it shall be automatically renewed for subsequent one year terms unless terminated by the parties 
the liquidity agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of either party 
alic and aic each serve as a lender and borrower and the corporation serves only as a lender 
aic also has a capital support agreement with alic effective december  under the capital support agreement  aic is committed to provide capital to alic to allow for profitable growth while maintaining an adequate capital level 
the maximum amount of potential funding under the intercompany and capital support agreements is billion 
allstate s domestic property liability and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile 
statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity  operating leverage and premium growth capacity  and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings 
as of december   aic s statutory surplus is approximately billion compared to billion at december  these amounts include alic s statutory surplus of billion at december   compared to billion at december  the decrease is the result of dividends paid to the allstate corporation  net loss and unrealized losses on equity securities and investments in alic 
we have received approval from the illinois division of insurance for the use of two permitted practices in the statutory basis financial statements related to areas in which statutory accounting is not reflective of the underlying economics during this period of extreme market conditions caused by the current economic crisis 
the first permitted practice relates to the statutory accounting for deferred taxes and applies to aic and alic 
specifically  this permitted practice increased the amount of deferred income tax asset that can be recognized in the statutory basis financial statements and included in statutory surplus from the lesser of the amounts that can be realized in one year or of adjusted statutory surplus to the lesser of deferred taxes that can be realized within years or of adjusted statutory surplus 
the permitted practice resulted in an increase in aic s statutory surplus of million as of december  which included an increase in alic s statutory surplus of million 
admitted statutory basis deferred tax assets on both companies totaled billion after the permitted practice reflecting approximately of total potential statutory basis deferred tax assets before non admission limitations 
the second permitted practice relates to statutory accounting for market value adjusted annuities mvaa whose related assets are held in a separate account in the statutory basis financial statements 
specifically  this permitted practice resulted in the mvaa related investments being recorded at amortized cost  which is consistent with statutory accounting for other fixed income investments and the book value method of accounting required under illinois code for mvaa investments held in a general account 
the permitted practice was requested because the illinois code is silent on mvaa that are issued by a separate account 
in the extreme market conditions of the economic crisis  the market value method of accounting reduced statutory surplus due to unrealized losses on investments caused by wide credit spreads and the liquidity based dislocations in the investment markets in a manner not representative of the economics of the related liabilities 
the effect of the permitted practice  which is to value the invested assets and insurance reserves on a book value basis instead of the formerly used market value basis  was million based on october  valuations and grew to billion at december  due to an increase of million in the investment unrealized loss position  while the market based reserves increased million relative to book basis reserves 
the permitted practice eliminated the inconsistent impacts in the amounts determined by the valuation methodologies for invested assets and insurance reserves and resulted in invested assets being valued at billion and reserves at billion 
the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company s premium growth capacity 
ratios in excess of to are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies 
aic s premium to surplus ratio was x on december  compared to x in the prior year 
state laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer s risk based capital rbc  a measure of an insurer s solvency  falls below certain levels 
the naic has a standard formula for annually assessing rbc 
the formula for calculating rbc for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing 
the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
at december   the rbc for each of our domestic insurance companies was within the range that we target 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges 
liquidity sources and uses our potential sources of funds principally include activities shown in the following table 
property liability allstate financial corporate and other receipt of insurance premiums x x allstate financial contractholder fund deposits x reinsurance recoveries x x receipts of principal  interest and dividends on investments x x x sales of investments x x x funds from investment repurchase agreements  securities lending  dollar roll  commercial paper and line of credit agreements x x x inter company loans x x x capital contributions from parent x x dividends from subsidiaries x x tax refunds settlements x x funds from periodic issuance of additional securities x funds from the settlement of our benefit plans x our potential uses of funds principally include activities shown in the following table 
property liability allstate financial corporate and other payment of claims and related expenses x payment of contract benefits  maturities  surrenders and withdrawals x reinsurance cessions and payments x x operating costs and expenses x x x purchase of investments x x x repayment of investment repurchase agreements  securities lending  dollar roll  commercial paper and line of credit agreements x x x payment or repayment of inter company loans x x x capital contributions to subsidiaries x x dividends to shareholders parent company x x x tax payments settlements x share repurchases x debt service expenses and repayment x x x settlement payments of employee and agent benefit plans x x x we actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market  economic  and business conditions 
in  in anticipation of continued volatility and illiquidity in the financial markets  we took actions to enhance our economic and liquidity position pending a return to normal capital market conditions 
these actions included managing our gross exposure to our largest tail risk exposures interest rate  equity  and catastrophes through active management of our investment and product portfolios as well as further mitigation through hedging and reinsurance 
accumulating higher cash and short term investment positions easily convertible to cash from asset sales  principal and interest receipts  calls  maturities and other cash inflows from our investment portfolio 
reducing our securities lending program to million as of december  from billion as of december  by reducing the securities lending program  we gained additional direct access to our liquid investments 
proactively selling securities we think will become less liquid 
suspension of share repurchase program 
on february   we announced that our shareholder dividend was being revised to 
we believe that these actions will provide us with a greater level of flexibility necessary to operate in the current market environment 
if market conditions warrant  we may take additional actions to enhance our liquidity position including continued retention of portfolio cash flows including approximately billion of expected inflows from upcoming maturities  calls and interest receipts on investments over the next six months 
the sale of fixed income government  municipal and investment grade corporate bonds and equity securities with unrealized capital gains at december  with a focus on preserving capital  we consider investments which are convertible to cash without generating significant additional net realized capital losses as liquidity sources 
the following table presents cash and short term positions easily convertible to cash  and certain other liquid investments meeting this criteria 
as of december  in millions property liability allstate financial corporate and other consolidated cash and short term positions easily convertible to cash available same day next day other highly liquid investments other liquid investments total liquid percent of total consolidated cash and investments other highly liquid investments are defined as assets that are generally saleable within one week  and primarily include common equity securities of billion  municipal bonds of billion  us government and agencies bonds of million  short term investments of million and agency pass through securities of million 
the amounts shown in the table above represent the amount of our holdings in these assets  excluding any holdings with restrictions 
other liquid investments are defined as assets that are saleable within one quarter  and primarily include municipal bonds of billion  short term investments of billion  corporate bonds of million and agency pass through securities of million 
the amounts shown in the table above represent the amount that we believe could be sold during the first quarter of  excluding any holdings with restrictions 
the above analysis identifies our access to internal sources of liquidity 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to address current planned needs from investments other than those for which we have asserted the intent to hold until recovery combined with targeted sales of certain allstate financial products 
additionally  we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management at an enterprise level and enhance flexibility across the company 
to increase new money for investing  we have initiated actions to accelerate the recovery of approximately billion of tax refunds from the overpayment of estimated taxes as well as the carryback of allstate financial ordinary losses and property liability capital losses to prior tax years 
million in refunds were received in february and we expect the remaining refunds to be received in the first half of the carryback of the non life companies capital losses will fully offset the capital gains from and  resulting in a remaining capital loss carryback capacity of billion from the life companies do not have the ability to carry back any capital losses to prior tax years 
parent company capital capacity at the parent holding company level  we have deployable cash and investments totaling billion as of december  these assets include highly liquid securities that are generally saleable within one week totaling billion  additional liquid investments that are saleable within one quarter totaling million  and million of investments that trade in illiquid markets 
the substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the corporation 
in  aic will have the capacity to pay dividends currently estimated at billion without prior regulatory approval 
we do not anticipate that alic will pay dividends to aic in in addition  we have access to billion of funds from either commercial paper issuance or an unsecured revolving credit facility 
this provides capital for the parent company s relatively low fixed charges  estimated at million in  and million of debt maturing in december  to the extent not refinanced prior to maturity 
in october  the corporation completed its previously approved capital contribution of billion of invested assets to aic 
in november  aic purchased a million surplus note from alic and made a capital contribution of million to alic 
an additional amount of approximately million remains under the authority granted by the corporation and aic boards on october  and october   respectively  to make capital contributions in the form of cash or securities  by providing a guaranty or guaranties  or by purchasing one or more surplus notes or other securities on or before april  moreover  in addition to these historic external sources of capital  access to funding from additional sources  including participation in programs offered by the us treasury and other governmental organizations  are potentially available to the corporation and its operating subsidiaries for capital and liquidity needs 
the corporation has access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was billion  however  the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily 
our primary credit facility is available for short term liquidity requirements and backs our commercial paper facility 
our billion unsecured revolving credit facility has an initial term of five years expiring in with two optional one year extensions that can be exercised at the end of any of the remaining four years of the facility upon approval of existing or replacement lenders providing more than two thirds of the commitments to lend 
the program is fully subscribed among lenders with the largest commitments being million 
the commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender s commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility 
none of the borrowing capacity under this credit facility has been utilized 
this facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional million of borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders 
this facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreement 
this ratio at december  was 
although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement  the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior  unsecured  nonguaranteed long term debt 
there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility 
a universal shelf registration statement was filed with the securities and exchange commission in may and will expire may in april  we expect to ask our board of directors for authority to file a replacement universal shelf registration 
we can use our current shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities  common stock including million shares of treasury stock as of december   preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and securities of subsidiaries 
the specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements 
liquidity exposure contractholder funds as of december  were billion 
the following table summarizes contractholder funds by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  in millions to total not subject to discretionary withdrawal subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges market value adjustments subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments total contractholder funds includes approximately billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
approximately billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment 
includes extendible funding agreements backing medium term notes outstanding with a par value of billion that have been non extended and become due by october  we have accumulated  and expect to maintain  short term and other maturing investments to fund the retirement of these obligations 
includes approximately billion of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to prudential effective june  while we are able to quantify scheduled maturities for our institutional products of billion in  anticipating retail product surrenders is less precise 
retail life and annuity products may be surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons 
reasons unique to individual customers include a current or unexpected need for cash or a change in life insurance coverage needs 
other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge  the length of time the contract has been in force  distribution channel  market interest rates  equity market conditions and potential tax implications 
in addition  the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re underwritten upon policy replacement 
surrenders and partial withdrawals for our retail annuities decreased in compared to the annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred annuities  interest sensitive life insurance and allstate bank products  based on the beginning of year contractholder funds  was and in and  respectively 
allstate financial strives to promptly pay customers who request cash surrenders  however  statutory regulations generally provide up to six months in most states to fulfill surrender requests 
our institutional products are primarily funding agreements backing medium term notes 
as of december   total institutional products outstanding were billion 
the following table presents the scheduled maturities for our institutional products outstanding as of december  in millions our asset liability management practices limit the differences between the cash flows generated by our investment portfolio and the expected cash flow requirements of our life insurance  annuity and institutional product obligations 
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our long term debt rating of a  a and a from moody s  s p s and am best  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb bb  a downgrade in aic s financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody s  s p s and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic s financial strength ratings from a  aa and a from moody s  s p s and am best  respectively to below a aa a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities 
the following table summarizes consolidated cash flow activities by business segment

property liability lower cash provided by operating activities for property liability in  compared to  was primarily due to higher claim payments resulting from catastrophe losses and lower investment income 
cash provided by operating activities for property liability in was comparable to cash flows provided by investing activities increased in compared to  primarily due to decreased purchases of fixed income securities  partially offset by increases in equity securities purchases  lower sales of fixed income securities  and net change in short term investments 
cash flows provided by investing activities increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased sales of equity securities

cash flows from investing activities increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by increased cash used in financing activities 
higher cash flows used in financing activities in compared to were primarily due to higher maturities and retirements of institutional products  partially offset by higher contractholder fund deposits 
cash flows used in financing activities increased in  compared to  primarily due to lower contractholder fund deposits 
for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
there were no dividends paid by allstate financial in in and  financing cash flows were impacted by dividends paid by allstate financial totaling million and million  respectively 
allstate financial cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by funds paid by aic to alic totaling billion in the billion includes capital contributions paid in cash totaling million and the issuance of two surplus notes  each with a principal sum of million  to aic in exchange for cash totaling million 
allstate financial cash flows from financing activities exclude capital contributions to alic comprising the transfer to alic from aic of non cash assets totaling million and the transfer of a million surplus note to kennett capital inc from alic in exchange for a note receivable with a principal sum equal to that of the surplus note  which was originally issued to alic by a subsidiary of alic 
one of the surplus notes issued to aic in was subsequently canceled and forgiven by aic resulting in the recognition of a capital contribution equal to the outstanding principal balance of the surplus note of million 
there were no capital contributions to alic in and corporate and other fluctuations in the corporate and other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements 
investing activities primarily relate to investments in the portfolios of kennett capital holdings  llc 
financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  repayment of debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements contractholder funds reserve for life contingent contract benefits long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense other liabilities and accrued expenses net unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business  including utilizing potential sources of liquidity as disclosed previously 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  including immediate annuities without life contingencies  bank deposits and institutional products 
the reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies 
these amounts reflect the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders 
certain of these contracts  such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to i policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and ii contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract 
extendible funding agreements backing medium term notes outstanding are reflected in the table above at the maturity date accelerated in accordance with the contractholders election to not extend the maturity date 
other contracts  such as interest sensitive life  fixed deferred annuities  traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and voluntary accident and health insurance  involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts and bank deposits  the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or illness or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts  and renewal premium for life policies  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liabilities of billion for contractholder funds and billion for reserve for life contingent contract benefits as included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension and opeb contributions are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
amount differs from the balance presented on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  because the long term debt amount above includes interest 
the pension plans obligations in the next months represent our planned contributions  and the remaining years contributions are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans 
the opeb plans obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid 
these liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  and as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion included in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial position 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense is an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above  especially for ibnr claims 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts which are our best estimates 
the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december   of billion and million  respectively 
other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding 
certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table exceeds the corresponding liability amount of billion 
balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of billion and deferred tax liabilities netted in the net deferred tax asset of billion 
these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties 
rather  they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis 
in addition  other liabilities of million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain 
net unrecognized tax benefits relate to financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
we believe it is reasonably possible that the fin liability balance will not significantly increase or decrease within the next months 
the resolution of this obligation may be for an amount different than what we have accrued 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional total commitments contractual commitments represent investment commitments such as private placements  limited partnership interests and mortgage loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required

enterprise risk and return management allstate has established enterprise risk and return management errm processes and infrastructure to effectively manage risk within our tolerances while optimizing risk adjusted returns 
we have a senior management committee called the enterprise risk return council errc which is responsible for overseeing enterprise risks 
enterprise risk and return management is a disciplined  holistic  integrated and interactive approach to risk that is conducted under an overall framework which increases transparency thereby providing additional insight when setting enterprise strategy identifies potential events that could have a significant impact on allstate proactively manages risk and optimizes our overall profile consistent with allstate s risk appetite provides greater assurance of achieving allstate s objectives allows allstate to pursue a return commensurate with the risks taken allstate s board of directors and audit committee provide enterprise risk management oversight by reviewing enterprise principles  guidelines and limits for allstate s significant risks and by monitoring major risk exposures  trends and actions management has taken to control these risks 
allstate s primary risk exposures result from the capital markets  followed by catastrophes and operational risk events 
allstate has been proactive in the face of financial market and economic turbulence by responding quickly to reduce exposures in at risk asset classes  implementing risk mitigation and return optimization programs designed to protect our investment portfolio values  and enhancing our liquidity position through a series of actions 
risk management is primarily executed within the business units where risk is undertaken 
our risk management programs include appropriate governance policies with established tolerances and risk limits  stochastic modeling software and analyses  risk identification  evaluation  prioritization  treatment and monitoring practices and effective communication and reporting 
chief risk officers and managers in the various business units are responsible for managing  measuring  evaluating  and reporting risks as appropriate in their respective areas within the risk appetite of the overall enterprise 
this includes items such as monitoring appropriate tolerances and managing exposure to catastrophes  managing the impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in risk free interest rates  credit spreads and equity markets through value at risk  duration and convexity metrics  managing liquidity levels in light of changing market  economic and business conditions  and evaluating risks related to credit exposures through credit value at risk measurements 
as appropriate  consistent enterprise wide measurement standards and limits are applied to key risks and are integrated into such processes as strategic and financial planning  capital management and enterprise risk reporting 
business unit measures and practices are aligned with overall enterprise standards 
economic capital is the amount of capital required to provide a given level of safety to stakeholders over a specific time horizon  given a defined enterprise wide tolerance for risk 
companies employ various methods and standards for determining economic capital 
at allstate  we utilize an internally developed enterprise stochastic model as significant input into our determination of an appropriate level of enterprise economic capital to hold  ensuring that we achieve regulatory rbc within the range that we target and appropriately consider rating agency perspectives 
our economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our various businesses 
economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand risk distributions and optimize risk reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses and various risks 
these capabilities allow us to view risk and return decisions holistically which may provide opportunities for enhanced returns to shareholders at similar or lower levels of risk than might be achieved if modeling and analyses were only applied at the business unit and individual risk level 
areas we are pursuing that may provide such opportunities include risk mitigation and return optimization programs in our investment portfolio and more emphasis on total return economics and absolute returns in addition to traditional net credit spreads 
we have also established an internal capital support agreement between certain legal entities to more fully capitalize on diversification benefits within the enterprise 
regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions  all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards there are several pending accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred 
for a discussion of these pending standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them
