commercial loans 
commercial lending is a focus of the company s lending activities  and a significant portion of its loan portfolio consists of commercial loans 
the company offers specialized loans for its business and commercial customers 
these include operating lines of credit that support accounts receivables and inventory  as well as secured term loans to finance machinery and equipment 
the company has historically reported loans in accordance with bank regulatory guidelines 
as a result  a substantial portion of the company s commercial loans are designated as real estate loans  as the loans are secured by mortgages or trust deeds on real property  although some of these loans were not made to finance real estate nor does the repayment depend on the sale of or income from the real estate 
lending decisions are based on careful evaluation of the financial strength  management and credit history of the borrower  and the quality of the collateral securing the loan

these services include a debit card program  automated teller machines at six branches  merchant services and an automated telephone banking service with hour access to accounts that also allows customers to speak directly with a customer service representative during normal banking hours 
the company provides drive through facilities at three of its branches 
market areas and competition the company s primary market areas in which it accepts deposits and makes loans are cowlitz county  in southwest washington  king county  washington  the portland metropolitan area in oregon  and the surrounding counties in washington and northwest oregon 
as a community bank  the bank has certain competitive advantages due to its local focus  but is also more closely tied to the local community than many of its competitors  which serve a number of geographic markets 
bay mortgage operations are concentrated in southwestern washington 
commercial banking in the state of washington and northwest oregon is highly competitive with respect to providing banking services including making loans and attracting deposits 
the company competes with other banks  as well as with savings and loan associations  savings banks  credit unions  mortgage companies  investment banks  insurance companies  securities brokerages and other financial institutions 
banking in washington and oregon is dominated by several significant banking institutions which together account for a majority of the total commercial and savings bank loans and deposits in washington and oregon 
these competitors have significantly greater financial resources and offer a greater number of branch locations with statewide branch networks  higher lending limits  and a variety of services not offered by the bank 
the company has attempted to offset some of the advantages of the large competitors by arranging participations with other banks for loans above its legal lending limits  as well as leveraging technology and third party arrangements to deliver financial products and better compete in targeted customer segments 
the company has positioned itself as a local alternative to larger competitors that may be perceived by customers or potential customers to be impersonal  out of touch with the community  or simply not interested in providing banking services to some of the target customers  by offering excellent customer service and investing in the markets it services through its business practices and community service 
in addition to larger institutions  other community banks and credit unions have been formed  expanded  or moved into the company s market areas and have developed a similar focus to the company 
this growing number of similar financial institutions and an increased focus by larger institutions on the company s market segments has led to intensified competition in all aspects of the company s business 
increased competitive pressure and changing customer deposit behaviors could adversely affect the bank s market share of deposits 
the adoption of the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act led to further competition in the financial services industry 
the glb act eliminated many of the barriers to affiliation among providers of various types of financial services and permitted business combinations among financial service providers such as banks  insurance companies  securities or brokerage firms and other financial service providers 
additionally  the rapid adoption of financial services through the internet has reduced or even eliminated many barriers to 
table of contents entry by financial services providers physically located outside our market areas 
for example  remote deposit services allow depository companies physically located in other geographical markets to service local businesses with minimal cost of entry 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in the financial services business in its markets to date  there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so in the future 
the financial services industry has experienced widespread consolidation over the last decade 
the company anticipates that consolidation among financial institutions in its market areas will continue and perhaps may accelerate as a result of the severe financial distress in the industry 
as noted  the company may seek acquisition opportunities in markets of strategic importance to it from time to time  if its financial condition permits 
however  other financial institutions aggressively compete against the company in the acquisition market 
some of these institutions may have greater access to capital markets  larger cash reserves and stock for use in acquisitions that is more liquid and more highly valued by the market 
employees as of december   the company employed a total of full time equivalent employees 
none of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and the company considers its relationships with its employees to be favorable 
regulation and supervision the company and the bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulations that significantly affect the respective activities of the company and the bank and the competitive environment in which they operate

proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
in the current economic climate and regulatory environment  the likelihood of enactment of new banking legislation and promulgation of new banking regulations is greater than it has been in recent years 
the potential impact of new laws and regulations on the company and its bank subsidiary cannot be determined  but any such laws and regulations may materially affect the business and prospects of the company and its subsidiary 
violation of the laws and regulations applicable to the company and its subsidiary may result in assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties  the imposition of a cease and desist order  and other regulatory sanctions or restrictions

capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies 
the federal reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies

see fdicia and capital requirements 
bank regulation 
the bank is organized under the laws of the state of washington and is subject to the supervision of the dfi  whose examiners conduct periodic examinations of state banks 
cowlitz bank is not a member of the federal reserve system  so its principal federal regulator is the fdic  which also conducts periodic examinations of the bank 
the bank s deposits are insured  to the maximum extent permitted by law  by the deposit insurance fund dif administered by the fdic and are subject to the fdic s rules and regulations respecting the insurance of deposits 
see fdic insurance assessments 
both federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements  truth in lending and truth in savings disclosures  equal credit opportunity  fair credit reporting  trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations 
current federal law also requires banks  among other things  to make deposited funds available within specified time periods 
insured state chartered banks are generally prohibited under fdicia from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks  unless i the fdic determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund  and ii the bank is  and continues to be  in compliance with all applicable capital standards 
the company believes that these restrictions do not have a material adverse effect on its current operations 
fdicia 
fdicia requires  among other things  federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the fdic has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
among other things  the regulations define the relevant capital measures for the five capital categories 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to a regulatory order  agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
the federal reserve board classifies a bank holding company as well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater and a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater 
the company and the bank are both well capitalized 

table of contents fdicia created a statutory framework of supervisory actions indexed to the capital level of an individual institution 
institutions that are deemed to be undercapitalized may be subject to mandatory supervisory corrective actions and face restrictions on increasing its average total assets  making acquisitions  establishing branches  engaging in a new line of business  accepting or renewing brokered deposits  paying interest rates on deposits in excess of regulatory limits and making senior executive management changes without prior regulatory approval 
additional broad regulatory authority is granted with respect to the lowest two capital categories significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized including forced mergers  ordering new elections for directors  forcing divestiture by its holding company  requiring management changes and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management 
additional mandatory and discretionary regulatory actions apply to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized banks  the latter being a bank with capital at or less than 
the primary federal regulatory agency may appoint a receiver or conservator for a critically undercapitalized bank after days  even if the bank is still solvent 
failure of a bank to maintain the required level of capital could result in such bank being declared insolvent and closed 
fdicia further directs that each federal banking agency prescribe standards for depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  management compensation  a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  a minimum ratio of market value to book value of publicly traded shares and such other standards as the agency deems appropriate 
capital requirements 
the fdic has adopted risk based capital ratio guidelines to which the bank is subject 
the guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
these guidelines divide a bank s capital into two tiers 
tier includes common equity  certain non cumulative perpetual preferred stock excluding auction rate issues and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships  subject to certain limitations 
supplementary tier capital includes  among other items  preferred stock cumulative perpetual and long term  limited life  mandatory convertible securities  certain hybrid capital instruments  term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations  less required deductions 
banks are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  of which must be tier capital 
the fdic may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
banks experiencing or anticipating significant growth are expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
in addition  the fdic has established guidelines prescribing a minimum tier leverage ratio tier capital to adjusted total assets of for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including that the banks have the highest regulatory rating and are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
all other banks are required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of not less than 
at december   the regulatory capital ratios for the company and the bank were december  company bank total risk based capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage ratio dividends 
the principal source of the company s cash revenues is dividends from the bank 
under washington law  the bank may not pay dividends in an amount greater than its retained earnings as determined 
table of contents by generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  dfi has the authority to require a state chartered bank to suspend the payment of dividends 
the fdic has the authority to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if  in its opinion  the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank or if it would cause a bank to become undercapitalized 
in addition  a bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet the adequately capitalized level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements 
also  the payment of cash dividends by the bank must satisfy a net profits test and an undivided profits test or the bank must obtain prior approval of its regulators before such dividend is paid 
the net profits test limits the dividend declared in any calendar year to the net profits of the current year plus retained net income of the preceding two years 
the undivided profits test limits the dividends declared to the undivided profits on hand after deducting bad debts in excess of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
lending limits 
under washington law  the total loans and extensions of credit by a washington chartered bank to a borrower outstanding at one time may not exceed of the bank s tier capital 
however  this limitation does not apply to loans or extensions of credit which are fully secured by readily marketable collateral having market value of at least of the amount of the loan or the extension of credit at all times 
branches and affiliates 
establishment of bank branches is subject to approval of the dfi and fdic and geographic limits established by state laws 
washington s branch banking law permits a bank having its principal place of business in the state of washington to establish branch offices in any county in washington without geographic restrictions 
a bank may also merge with any national or state chartered bank located anywhere in the state of washington without geographic restrictions 
under oregon law  an out of state bank or bank holding company may merge with or acquire an oregon state chartered bank or bank holding company if the oregon bank  or in the case of a bank holding company  the subsidiary bank  has been in existence for a minimum of three years  and the law of the state in which the acquiring bank is located permits such merger 
branches may not be acquired or opened separately  but once an out of state bank has acquired branches in oregon  either through a merger with or acquisition of substantially all of the assets of an oregon bank  the bank may open additional branches 
the bank is subject to provisions of the federal reserve act that restrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies 
the statute limits credit transactions between a bank and its executive officers and its affiliates  prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices  and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank s extension of credit to an affiliate 
fdic insurance assessments 
the fdic is an independent federal agency established originally to insure the deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and to preserve the safety and soundness of the banking industry 
the fdic has adopted a risk based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities 
the bank s deposit accounts are insured by the fdic to the maximum extent permitted by law 
the bank pays deposit insurance premiums to the fdic based on a risk based assessment system established by the fdic for all insured institutions 
institutions considered well capitalized and financially sound pay the lowest premiums  while those institutions that are less than adequately capitalized and of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premiums 
during  assessment rates for insured institutions ranged from cents per of assessable deposits for well capitalized institutions with minor supervisory concerns to cents per of assessable deposits for undercapitalized institutions with substantial supervisory concerns 
in  assessment rates are expected to range between and cents per of assessable deposits for the first quarter and and cents per of assessable deposits for the remainder of the year 
the large premium increase is due to the emergency economic stabilization act of and the temporary liquidity guarantee program  both of which 
table of contents increased the deposit insurance coverage available to the bank s depositors 
further increases in the assessment rate or special assessments to rebuild the deposit insurance fund could have a material adverse affect on the company s earnings  depending on the amount of the rate increase or special assessment

in order to promote financial stability in the economy  the fdic adopted the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp on october  participation in the program is voluntary 
however  once participation is elected  it cannot be revoked 
the bank has chosen to participate in the transaction account guarantee program component of the tlgp 
under the transaction account guarantee program  the fdic will fully insure funds held in non interest bearing transaction accounts 
non interest bearing transaction accounts are ones that do not accrue or pay interest and for which the institution does not require an advance notice of withdrawal

the reform act authorized the fdic to revise the risk based assessment system 
accordingly  insurance premiums are based on a number of factors  including the risk of loss that insured institutions pose to the dif 
the reform act replaced the minimum reserve ratio of with a range of between and for the dif  depending on projected losses  economic changes and assessment rates at the end of each calendar year 
in addition  the fdic is no longer prohibited from charging banks in the lowest risk category when the reserve ratio premium is greater than

the regulatory agency assigns one of four possible ratings to an institution s cra performance and is required to make public an institution s rating and written evaluation 
the four possible ratings are outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve and substantial non compliance 
many factors play a role in assessing a financial institution s cra performance 
the institution s regulator must consider its financial capacity and size  legal impediments  local economic conditions and demographics and the competitive environment in which it operates 
the evaluation does not rely on absolute standards and financial institutions are not required to perform specific activities or to provide specific amounts or types of credit 
the company s most recent rating under cra is satisfactory 
this rating reflects the company s commitment to meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves 
although the company strives to maintain a satisfactory or higher rating  no assurance can be given that the company will maintain this rating in the future 
if the company s cra rating were to fall below satisfactory it may inhibit its ability to obtain regulatory approval for acquisitions or expansion

while generally containing lower risk than unsecured loans  commercial real estate and construction loans generally involve higher credit risk than conventional single family residential loans 
such loans also generally involve larger individual loan balances 
in addition  real estate construction loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because many real estate construction borrowers ability to repay their loans is dependent on successful development of their properties  as well as the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon whether the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of property construction including interest and the availability of permanent take out financing 
during the construction phase  a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns 
construction and commercial real estate loans also involve greater risk because they may not be fully amortizing over the loan period  but have a balloon payment due at maturity 
a borrower s ability to make a balloon payment may depend on the borrower being able to refinance the loan  timely sell the underlying property or liquidate other assets 
the current us recession has resulted in a reduction in the value of the real estate assets securing a large portion of the loans that we hold 
an increasing number of borrowers have become delinquent or defaulted on their loans  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
a further increase in the number of delinquencies or defaults would result in higher levels of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provision for loan losses  adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
recent legislation in response to market and economic conditions may not stabilize the financial services industry or the us economy 
disruptions in the financial system during have resulted in significantly reduced business activity throughout the global and us economies  which have the potential to significantly affect financial institutions 
in response to this financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law on october  a number of programs have been and are being developed and implemented under eesa 
the eesa may not have the intended effect and therefore the condition of the financial services industry may worsen instead of improve 
the failure of the eesa to improve the condition of the us banking system could significantly adversely impact our business  our financial condition  our financial results  our access to funding or capital as well as the trading price of our common stock or other instruments 
the administration of president barack obama recently announced a comprehensive mortgage relief plan 
the effects of this plan and any other similar programs or initiatives that may be implemented are difficult to predict  but they could result in increased losses to the bank  either directly or indirectly through the bank s ownership of investment securities  including mortgage backed securities 
the impact on us of recently enacted legislation  in particular the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  and their implementing regulations  and actions by the fdic  cannot be predicted at this time 
the programs established or to be established under the eesa  arra and troubled asset relief program are evolving and may have adverse effects on us 
we may face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
also  participation in specific programs may subject us to additional restrictions 
for example  participation in the troubled asset relief program will limit without the consent of the us treasury department a participating company s ability to pay a dividend on common stock or to repurchase its common stock for so long as any securities issued under such program remain outstanding 
it will also subject a participating company to additional executive compensation restrictions 
similarly  programs established by the fdic under the systemic risk exception of the federal deposit act  may have an adverse effect on us  whether or not we participate in the 
table of contents programs 
participation in the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program requires the payment of additional insurance premiums to the fdic based upon the increased deposit coverage afforded there under 
further  we will be required to pay significantly higher federal deposit insurance corporation premiums because market developments have decreased the insurance fund at the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
the full effects of these various programs cannot reliably be determined at this time 
conditions in the financial markets may limit our access to additional funding to meet our liquidity needs 
liquidity is crucial to the operation of the company and the bank 
liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to fund increases in assets or meet payment obligations  including obligations to depositors  as they become due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding or liquidate assets 
for example  funding illiquidity may arise if we are unable to attract core deposits or are unable to renew at acceptable pricing long term borrowings or short term borrowings from the overnight inter bank market  the federal home loan bank system  brokered deposits  or the federal reserve discount window 
illiquidity may also arise if our regulatory capital levels decrease  our lenders require additional collateral to secure our repayment obligations  or a large amount of our deposits are withdrawn 
we may also experience illiquidity due to unexpected cash outflows on committed lines of credit or financial guarantees or due to unexpected events 
the increasingly competitive retail deposit environment increases liquidity risk and increases our cost of funds as increasingly sophisticated depositors move funds more frequently in search of higher rates or better opportunities 
the company s liquidity may be negatively impacted by regulatory or statutory restrictions on payment of cash dividends by the bank 
we monitor our liquidity risk and seek to avoid over concentration of funding sources and to establish and maintain back up funding facilities that we can draw down if normal funding sources become unavailable 
if we fail to control our liquidity risks  there may be materially adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may need to raise additional capital which may not be available or may adversely affect existing shareholders 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future through debt or equity financings to maintain desired levels of capital ratios  to improve its financial condition  or to increase liquidity available for operations 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may not be available on terms that are favorable to the company 
in the case of equity financings  significant dilution to the company s shareholders could result and  in any case  securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
under the company s articles of incorporation  it may issue preferred equity without first obtaining shareholders approval 
debt financing could also negatively affect future earnings due to interest charges 
in the event additional capital is unavailable on acceptable terms through available financing sources  we may take steps to preserve capital  including possibly slowing our lending activities and new loan commitments  selling certain assets or increasing loan participations 
if the bank is unable to pay cash dividends to the holding company to meet its cash obligations  the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 
dividends paid by the bank to the company provide cash flow used to service interest payments on trust preferred securities 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the company without regulatory approval 
it is possible that depending upon the financial condition of the bank and other factors  the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other payments  including payments to the company  is an unsafe or unsound practice 
if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the company  the company may not be able to service its debt or pay its obligations 
the inability to receive dividends from the bank would adversely affect the business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 

table of contents a significant decline in the company s market value could result in an impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
recently  the company s common stock has been trading at a price significantly below its book value 
the company evaluated its goodwill totaling million as of december   due to a decrease in the company s market capitalization  and concluded that there was no impairment 
the valuation of goodwill is determined using discounted cash flows of forecasted earnings  estimated sales price based on recent observable market transactions and market capitalization based on current stock price 
if impairment of goodwill was deemed to exist  we would be required to write down our assets resulting in a charge to earnings 
a write down of goodwill due to impairment would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition  however  it would have no impact on our regulatory capital 
the value of certain securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in the market for these securities 
the market for certain investment securities held within our investment portfolio has over the past year become more volatile 
the volatile market may detrimentally affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks  in addition to interest rate risk typically associated with these securities 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary or permanent impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s net income and capital levels 
market and other constraints on our construction loan origination volumes are expected to lead to decreases in the company s interest and fee income that are not expected to be offset by reductions in our non interest expenses 
due to existing conditions in housing markets in the areas where we operate and other factors  management projects our construction loan originations to be materially constrained throughout this will lower interest income and fees generated from this part of our business 
unless this revenue decline is offset by other areas of our operations  our total revenues may decline relative to our total non interest expenses 
management expects that it will be difficult to find new revenue sources in the near term to completely offset expected declines in our interest income 
the company is extremely sensitive to the economy of the pacific northwest 
we operate primarily in cowlitz county  washington  the seattle bellevue metropolitan area  and the vancouver  washington and portland  oregon metropolitan area 
local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of collateral securing loans  the demand for our products and services  and the stability of deposits that create liquidity to support lending activities 
deteriorating real estate market conditions and an economic downturn in the pacific northwest have negatively affected our business 
worsening conditions in the pacific northwest real estate markets could continue to adversely affect our borrowers ability to repay as well as affect the value of the collateral underlying our loans  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has a concentration of real estate collateral securing loans 
many of our loans are secured by real estate located in washington and oregon 
a decline in the real estate market could lead to a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to our customers 
our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would be diminished  and we would be more likely to incur losses on defaulted loans 

table of contents we foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for many of our loans as part of our business 
increased other real estate owned oreo balances lead to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties 
we expect that our earnings in will be negatively affected by various expenses associated with oreo  including personnel costs  insurance and taxes  completion and repair costs  and other costs associated with property ownership  as well as by the funding costs associated with assets that are tied up in oreo 
any decrease in market prices may lead to oreo write downs  with a corresponding expense in our income statement 
interest rates are subject to constant  often unpredictable changes and could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
interest and fees on loans and securities  net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings  are a large part of the company s net income 
interest rates are key drivers of net interest margin and are subject to many factors beyond the control of management 
as interest rates change  net interest income is affected 
rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in financial instrument maturities 
rapid decreases in interest rates could result in interest income decreasing faster than interest expense  for example  if management is unable to match decreases in earning assets yields  with reduced rates paid on deposits or borrowings 
periods of low market interest rates  such as exist today  has adversely affected our net interest spread and net interest income because our earning assets yield decreases during a time that our cost of interest bearing liabilities is already low and cannot be reduced further 
further  substantially higher interest rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth  particularly in construction lending 
a rapid rise in interest rates could also reduce debt service coverage ratios of borrowers 
decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities  and therefore decrease net interest income 
for more information on this topic see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate 
we maintain an allowance for estimated loan losses that we believe is adequate for absorbing the inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
management determines the provision for loan losses based on a continual evaluation of lending concentrations  specific credit risks  past loan loss experience  loan portfolio and collateral quality  and relevant economic  political and regulatory conditions 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating  and other conditions  including changes in interest rates and deteriorating values in underlying collateral much of which consists of real estate that may be beyond our control  and such losses may exceed the allowance for estimated loan losses 
although management believes that the allowance for estimated loan losses is adequate to absorb any inherent losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
significant increases to the provision for loan losses may be necessary if our assumptions are incorrect or material adverse changes in general economic conditions occur or the performance of our loan portfolio deteriorates 
an extended recession or further weakening of the economy or a specific industry sector or a rapid change in market rates could adversely affect our borrowers ability to repay loans 
additionally  banking regulators  as an integral part of their supervisory function  periodically review the allowance for estimated loan losses 
if these regulatory agencies require us to increase the allowance for estimated loan losses  it could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
in the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing loans 
there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances will be found on these properties  in which case we may be liable for remediation costs and related personal injury and property damage 
compliance with environmental laws may require the bank to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 

table of contents environmental indemnifications obtained from borrowers and their principals or affiliates may not adequately compensate the bank for losses related to environmental conditions 
the remediation costs and financial liabilities associated with environmental conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our information technology and communications systems to conduct our business 
we rely heavily on communications  electricity  and information systems to conduct our business 
in addition  we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure  including loan  deposit and general ledger processing  internet connections  and network access 
any disruption in service of these key components could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our operations 
furthermore  security breaches of our information systems or data  whether managed by us or by third parties  could harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us 
security breaches could also subject the bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose the bank to civil litigation and possible financial liability 
the financial services industry is extremely competitive 
the company competes with well established  large banks based outside of the region  community banks  credit unions  thrift institutions  investment banking firms  insurance companies  payday loan offices and mortgage lenders for depositors and borrowers 
management believes the most significant competitive factor is customer service  in addition to competitively priced loans and deposits  for structure  branch locations and the range of banking products and services offered 
offices of the major financial institutions have competitive advantages over the company in that they have high public visibility  may offer a wider variety of products and are able to maintain advertising and marketing activities on a much larger scale than the company can economically maintain 
since single borrower lending limits imposed by law are dependent on the capital of the institution  the branches of larger institutions with substantial capital bases also have an advantage with respect to loan applications that are in excess of the company s legal lending limits 
we are currently in a particularly competitive market for low cost deposits  which has led to increase pressure on our deposit balances and net interest margin 
in competing for deposits  the company is subject to certain limitations not applicable to non bank financial institution competitors 
in cowlitz county  the main source of competition for deposits is the relatively large number of credit unions 
large new entrants into the deposit market  such as gmac  american express and morgan stanley  have much greater resources than we do and a history of competing aggressively in consumer and business markets 
federal and state regulations applicable only to banks and bank holding companies also place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies  credit unions  mortgage banking companies and leasing companies 
although the company has been able to compete effectively in its market area in the past  there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so 
with significant competition in the company s market areas  there can be no assurance that the company can continue to attract significant loan and deposit customers 
the inability to attract these customers could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the financial services industry is heavily regulated and additional laws and regulations are often considered at the state and federal level 
the company and the bank are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect customers  depositors and the deposit insurance fund  rather than shareholders 
the bank is a washington state chartered commercial bank whose primary regulator is the 
table of contents washington department of financial institutions 
the bank is also subject to the supervision by and the regulations of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  which insures bank deposits 
the company is subject to regulation and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the sec and nasdaq 
federal and state regulations may place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies  credit unions  mortgage banking companies and leasing companies 
if we receive less than satisfactory results on regulatory examinations  we could be restricted from making acquisitions  adding new branches  developing new lines of business or otherwise continuing our growth strategy for a period of time 
future changes in federal and state banking regulations could adversely affect our operating results and ability to continue to compete effectively 
if we acquire companies in the future  our earnings could be reduced if we are unable to successfully integrate operations 
we explore opportunities to acquire other banks 
if we are able to find a suitable acquisition opportunity and negotiate and close a transaction  but we experience difficulty in integrating an acquired company  consequently  we may not realize expected revenue enhancements  cost savings  increases in geographic presence or other projected benefits 
integration could also disturb customer and employee relationships at the acquired company  causing deposit run off and loss of key employees 
resources spent on integration may also detract from our ability to grow existing business 
we may not be able to attract or retain key banking employees 
we strive to attract and retain key banking professionals  management and staff 
competition to attract the best professionals in the industry can be intense which will limit our ability to hire new professionals 
banking related revenues and net income could be adversely affected in the event of the unexpected loss of key personnel 
our business may be harmed by adverse events at other financial institutions 
financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  correspondent banking  counterparty  and other relationships and because of regulatory factors 
we enter into transactions with financial services companies  including commercial banks and correspondent banks 
many of these transactions expose the company and the bank to credit and bankruptcy risk in the event of a default or bankruptcy by a counterparty 
the bank may also be negatively impacted by the failure of other banks 
for example  as a depository of public funds  the bank will be assessed  and the bank is statutorily obligated to pay  a pro rata share of the losses of public funds held at a failed public depository in oregon and washington 
in addition  assessments the bank pays to the fdic and others  including deposit insurance premiums  will increase even further in the event of bank failures or other adverse events affecting the banking system generally or the bank in particular 
recently  the fhlb of seattle announced that it did not meet minimum regulatory capital requirements  due to the deterioration in the market value of their mortgage backed securities portfolio 
as a result  the fhlb of seattle cannot pay a dividend on their common stock and it cannot repurchase or redeem common stock 
while the fhlb of seattle has announced it does not anticipate that additional capital is immediately necessary  nor does it believe that its capital level is inadequate to support realized losses in the future  the fhlb of seattle could require its members  including cowlitz bank  to contribute additional capital in order to return the fhlb of seattle to compliance with capital guidelines 
we are highly dependent on the fhlb of seattle to provide the primary source of wholesale funding for immediate liquidity and borrowing needs 
the failure of the fhlb of seattle or the fhlb system in general  may materially impair our ability to meet our growth plans or to meet short and long term liquidity needs 
should the fhlb of seattle fail  we anticipate that our investment in the fhlb s common stock would be other than temporarily impaired and may have no value 

table of contents negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity 
reputational risk  or the risk to our business  earnings  liquidity  and capital from negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas  including legal and regulatory compliance  lending practices  corporate governance  litigation  ethical issues  or inadequate protection of customer information 
we expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements 
failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs 
damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers  and adversely impact our earnings  liquidity and stock price 
changes in accounting standards may impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets  liabilities and financial results 
periodically  new accounting standards are imposed or existing standards are revised 
these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion of significant business trends and uncertainties as well as certain forward looking statements and is intended to be read in conjunction with and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the consolidated financial statements of the company and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements  see item a 
risk factors and the risk factors discussed on page immediately following the table of contents 
critical accounting estimates the company s most critical accounting policy is related to the allowance for credit losses  which consists of two components the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments 
the company utilizes both quantitative and qualitative considerations in establishing an allowance for credit losses believed to be appropriate as of each reporting date 
quantitative factors include the volume and severity of non performing loans and adversely classified credits  the level of net charge offs experienced on previously classified loans  the nature and value of collateral securing the loans  the trend in loan growth and the percentage of change  the level of geographic and or industry concentration  the relationship and trend over the past several years of recoveries in relation to charge offs  and other known factors regarding specific loans 
qualitative factors include the effectiveness of credit administration  the adequacy of loan review  the adequacy of loan operations personnel and processes  the effect of competitive issues that impact loan underwriting and structure  the impact of economic conditions including interest rate trends  the introduction of new loan products or specific marketing efforts  large credit exposure and trends  and industry segments that are exhibiting stress 
changes in the above factors could significantly affect the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management performs a full analysis  no less often than quarterly  to ensure that changes in estimated loan loss levels are adjusted on a timely basis 
for further discussion of this significant management estimate  see allowance for credit losses 
another critical accounting policy of the company is that related to the carrying value of goodwill 
impairment analysis of the fair value of goodwill involves a substantial amount of judgment 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill on january  and periodically tests goodwill for impairment 

table of contents the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make highly subjective judgments in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
events and factors that may significantly affect the analysis include a significant decline in the company s expected future cash flows  a substantial increase in the discount factor  a sustained  significant decline in the company s stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate 
other factors might include changing competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  revenue trends and cost structures  along with specific industry and market conditions 
adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of intangible assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment analysis involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the company s fair value to its carrying value 
management estimates fair value using a combination of the income approach and market approach with the best information available  including market information and discounted cash flow analysis 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  the company was identified as a single reporting unit 
the market approach estimates the fair value of a company by examining the price at which similar companies  or shares of similar companies  are exchanged 
based on management s goodwill impairment analysis  it was determined that the company s fair value exceeded its carrying value and therefore indicated no potential impairment under step one of the process 
further erosion of the company s stock price could lead to a future goodwill impairment write down 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit was determined to have been higher than its fair value  there would have been an indication that impairment may have existed and the second step would have been performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  a company would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  the company would record an impairment charge for the difference 
due to the ongoing uncertainty in market conditions  which may continue to negatively impact the performance of the company as well as the market valuations of financial institutions  including cowlitz bancorporation  management will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of goodwill 
goodwill impairment could be recorded in future periods and such impairment could be material to the company s results of operations 
recent industry and regulatory developments on october   congress approved the billion emergency economic stabilization act of eesa 
the first phase of implementation of eesa included a billion treasury capital purchase program 
the company applied for up to three percent of its total risk weighted assets in capital  which would be in the form of non cumulative perpetual preferred stock of the institution with a dividend rate of until the fifth anniversary of the investment  and thereafter 
the company s application is currently pending 
in addition  the company is currently exploring the possibility  should economic conditions continue to deteriorate or strategic opportunities present themselves  of seeking additional capital to bolster the company s capital and liquidity positions in this time of uncertainty and economic challenge 
the company may not be able to obtain either tarp or private equity financing or it may be only available on terms that are unfavorable to the company and its shareholders 
the company believes that an investment by the treasury through the tarp program may be conditioned on the company s receipt of private equity capital 
if as a result of a regulatory exam the bank is downgraded to adequately capitalized by regulatory standards  the bank may no longer be eligible to receive funds through the tarp program 
in the event additional capital is not available from the tarp program or on 
table of contents acceptable terms through available financing sources  the company may instead take additional steps to preserve capital  including slowing or reducing lending  selling certain assets  and or increasing loan participations 
the company does not pay cash dividends 
in october   the fdic introduced the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp  a program designed to improve the functioning of the credit markets and to strengthen capital in the financial system during this period of economic distress 
the tlgp has two components a debt guarantee program  guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt  and a transaction account guarantee program  providing a full guarantee of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal or now accounts paying less than annual interest  and interest on lawyers trust accounts  regardless of the amount 
the bank is presently participating in the transaction account guarantee program and  as such  all funds in covered accounts held through december  will be covered with a full guarantee 
on february   the treasury announced the terms and conditions for the capital assistance program cap 
the purpose of the cap is to restore confidence throughout the financial system by providing that the nation s largest banking institutions have a sufficient capital cushion against larger than expected future losses  should they occur due to a more severe economic environment  and to support lending to creditworthy borrowers 
under cap  federal banking supervisors will conduct forward looking assessments to evaluate the capital needs of the major us banking institutions under a more challenging economic environment 
should that assessment indicate that an additional capital buffer is warranted  banks will have an opportunity to turn first to private sources of capital 
in light of the current challenging market environment  the treasury is making government capital available immediately through the cap to eligible banking institutions to provide this buffer 
eligible us banking institutions with assets in excess of billion on a consolidated basis are required to participate in the coordinated supervisory assessments  and may access the cap immediately as a means to establish any necessary additional buffer 
eligible us banking institutions with consolidated assets below billion may also obtain capital from the cap 
capital provided under the cap will be in the form of a preferred security that is convertible into common equity at a percent discount to the price prevailing prior to february  cap securities will carry a percent dividend yield and would be convertible at the issuer s option subject to the approval of their regulator 
after years  the security would automatically convert into common equity if not redeemed or converted before that date 
companies who participate in the cap will be subject to similar conditions as are imposed under the tarp program 
results of operations overview for the year ended december   the company s net loss was million  or per diluted share 
this compares with net income of  or per diluted share  and million  or per share  for the corresponding periods ended december   and  respectively 
average loans in totaled million  an increase of over  and up significantly from million in this loan growth  mostly in commercial and real estate loans  was funded primarily by the growth in deposits  with a significant portion consisting of certificates of deposits 
net interest income was down slightly compared with and results

analysis of net interest income the primary component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and other borrowings 
changes in net interest income  net interest spread  and net interest margin result from changes in asset and liability volume mix and to rates earned or paid 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to total interest earning assets and is influenced by the volume and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

table of contents provision for credit losses the amount of the allowance for credit losses is analyzed by management on a regular basis to ensure that it is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the reporting date 
when a provision for credit losses is recorded  the amount is based on the current volume of loans and commitments to extend credit  anticipated changes in loan volumes  past charge off experience  management s assessment of the risk of loss on current loans  the level of non performing and impaired loans  evaluation of future economic trends in the company s market area  and other factors relevant to the loan portfolio 
an internal loan risk grading system is used to evaluate probable losses of individual loans 
the company does not  as part of its analysis  group loans together by loan type to assign risk 
see the allowance for credit losses disclosure for a more detailed discussion 
the company s provision for credit losses was million for the year ended december   compared with million and million the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily related to an increase in nonperforming loans and downgrades within the portfolio primarily attributable to the continued weak housing market and its impact on the bank s land acquisition and development portfolio  the increase in loans charged off and the increase in the total loan portfolio

table of contents fdic assessments represent premiums payable to the fdic for deposit insurance and financing corporation fico assessments 
in  no deposit insurance premiums were assessed 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of reform act created a new system and rate schedule related to fdic deposit insurance assessments effective in as a result  the company was assessed deposit insurance premiums beginning in  however  most of the premium was offset by a one time assessment credit that was provided to eligible institutions as part of the reform act 
the one time deposit insurance assessment credit was fully exhausted in the increase in fdic assessments in compared with prior years was a result of increased deposit insurance assessments rates and no remaining one time assessment credits available to offset the current period expense 
in february  the fdic issued a rule that further amends the system for risk based deposit insurance assessments and increases assessment rates 
in addition  the fdic announced a basis point special assessment on deposits as of june  this rule also provides that the fdic may impose additional special assessments in any quarter after june  to support the deposit insurance fund of up to basis point of deposits 
as the fdic attempts to restore the deposit insurance fund to targeted reserve ratios  the company s fdic insurance assessment rates applicable in will increase and may have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company has investments in limited partnerships that own and operate affordable housing projects or invest in small businesses 
the company s allocated share of investment gains or losses is included in non interest expense as equity valuation adjustments in limited partnership investments 
these investments serve as an element of compliance with the community reinvestment act 
the company recognizes its proportionate share of management fees  operating losses and equity valuation adjustments as a component of non interest expense 
tax credits related to these investments are recorded as a component of the tax provision 
in addition to the discussion above  most types of expenses were higher in compared with these increases were primarily a reflection of the overall higher level of staffing  including hiring costs  merit increases and performance based pay  occupancy  and data processing

table of contents at december   the company s investment securities had total net unrealized losses of million  compared with net unrealized losses of  at december  unrealized gains and losses reflect changes in market conditions and do not represent the amount of actual profits or losses the company may ultimately realize 
management may consider selling certain securities and realize gains and or losses in the company s investment portfolio on an ongoing basis as part of the company s overall business strategy 
the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine whether any of its securities are other than temporarily otti impaired 
in addition to accounting and regulatory guidance  in determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired  the company periodically considers the duration and amount of each unrealized loss  the financial condition of the issuer and the company s ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of value  which may be maturity and other factors 
at december   the company determined there were no otti securities in the investment portfolio 
otti charges totaling  were recorded in on  shares of fnma investment grade perpetual callable preferred stock  reflecting the extraordinarily unsettled equity market for this government sponsored enterprise following the federal government s actions to place the gse under conservatorship and suspend preferred stock dividends 
based on its assessment  management determined that the impairment was otti in accordance with gaap and that the charges were appropriate 
at december   of the company s investment portfolio was mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds and other securities 
the company s mortgage backed securities are all highly rated  investment grade securities primarily issued by government sponsored organizations 
the company has not invested in securities backed by sub prime mortgages and believes its investment portfolio has negligible exposure to such risk at this date 
the mix of available for sale and held to maturity investment securities is considered in the context of the company s overall asset liability management policy and illustrates management s assessment of the relative liquidity of the company 
the composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects management s strategy regarding maintenance of an appropriate level of liquidity  while providing a relatively stable source of interest income 
management utilizes the securities portfolio to mitigate interest rate risk and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
in addition  investment securities provide a vehicle for the investment of available funds  a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements and collateral for certain public funds deposits

for the purposes of the maturity schedule  mortgage backed securities  which are not due at a single maturity date  have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the expected maturity of the underlying collateral 
mortgage backed securities may mature earlier than their stated contractual maturities because of accelerated principal repayments of the underlying loans 

table of contents loans the following table presents the composition of the company s loan portfolio in accordance with bank regulatory classifications and the balance of allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial real estate construction residential family multifamily commercial installment and other consumer total loans  gross deferred loan fees loans  net of deferred loan fees allowance for loan losses total loans  net loans totaled million at december   a increase over total loans at december  the company s lending strategy is to build a loan portfolio that services the needs of our customers and communities  maximizes earnings  and mitigates credit risk 
during the period through  the bank increased the number of commercial loan officers and expanded its commercial lending relationships 
in  commercial loans increased over december  amounts and loans collateralized by real estate increased 
commencing in  management plans not to solicit additional business for residential construction projects until the housing market stabilizes and begins to show signs of improvement 
in addition  management anticipates a very cautious approach to extending any new credit  especially in non owner occupied commercial and residential real estate loans 
commercial and industrial loans commercial and industrial loans totaled million  or of the total loan portfolio  an increase of approximately over the balance at year end expanding the company s commercial and industrial loan portfolio  along with increases in deposits  is a major component of our strategic initiatives 
the company expects its commercial lending focus to center around expanding our existing banking relationships with business and business owners while continuing to build new customer relations 
real estate loans real estate loans have historically represented a significant portion of the company s total loan portfolio and real estate is often a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
total real estate secured loans were of the total loan portfolio at december  compared with of year end risks associated with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  demand and prices for housing or commercial properties  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in tax policy  and concentrations within the bank s market area 
the company s loan origination process requires specialized underwriting  collateral and approval procedures  which mitigates but does not eliminate the risk that loans may not be repaid 

table of contents the company s construction and land development loans as of december  were of the total loan portfolio  approximately equal to the proportion at year end  and up million from december  the increase primarily related to draw downs of existing commitments rather than underwriting of new relationships 
the following table illustrates real estate construction loans by project type 
december  residential construction family residential multi family condominiums residential land development commercial construction residential construction loans 
residential construction  which includes family residential  multi family and condominiums  represents financing where the obligor generally intends to own the home upon construction pre sold or builder construction of home for resale speculative construction 
with the recent turmoil in the mortgage markets  no assurance can be made that committed take out financing will be available at conclusion of construction for pre sold construction loans 
speculative construction lending finances builders contractors who rely on sale of completed homes to repay loans 
due to the nationwide downturn in residential real estate  certain builders have been affected by longer marketing periods for their constructed homes  reduced borrower liquidity and falling collateral values 
residential land development loans 
residential land development loans represent loans to developers for the purpose of acquiring raw land and or for the subsequent development and sale of residential lots 
the primary source of repayment of such loans is generally cash flow from developer sale of lots or improved parcels of land where real estate collateral  secondary sources and personal guarantees may provide an additional measure of security for such loans 
the nationwide downturn in residential real estate has affected certain developers by reducing their cash flows due to sluggish sales  lengthening the marketing period for their projects and sharply declining underlying loan collateral values 
weakness in this category of loans contributed significantly to the elevated level of provision for credit losses in commercial construction loans 
commercial construction balances represent lending to finance the construction or development of commercial properties 
obligors may be the business owner occupier of the building who intends to operate its business from the property upon construction  or non owner speculative developers 
the expected source of repayment of these loans is typically the sale or refinancing of the project upon completion of the construction phase 
in certain circumstances  the company may provide or commit to take out financing upon construction 
take out financing is subject to the project meeting specific underwriting guidelines 
while our portfolio of these loans has not experienced the severe credit quality challenges experienced in residential construction projects  there can be no assurance that the credit quality in this portfolio will not be affected should the challenging economic conditions of the present persist 
residential one to four family loans 
residential one to four family loans are used by the bank to collateralize advances from the fhlb 
the company s underwriting standards require that one to four family portfolio loans generally be owner occupied and that loan amounts not exceed with private mortgage insurance of the appraised value or cost  whichever is lower  of the underlying collateral at origination 
the company utilizes an outsourced residential lending underwriting platform 
residential loans are originated on a pre sold basis provided they meet the underwriting criteria established by our third party provider 
if circumstances warrant  the company may originate and retain loans that fall outside the scope of our third party provider s underwriting guidelines 
however  the company does not underwrite residential real estate loans for the subprime market 

table of contents commercial real estate 
commercial real estate generally represent loans to finance retail  office and industrial commercial properties  both owner occupied and non owner occupied 
the expected source of repayment is generally the operations of the borrower s business  rents or the obligor s personal income 
management believes that commercial real estate collateral may provide an additional measure of security for these loans  and that lending to owner occupied businesses mitigates  but does not eliminate  commercial real estate risk 
the company s commercial real estate portfolio to date has experienced low delinquency rates and only modest deterioration in the present downturn 
however  no assurance can be given that residential real estate or other economic factors will not affect this portfolio 
december  commercial real estate owner occupied non owner occupied at december   the bank had total unfunded loan commitments  including credit available under commercial and home equity lines  letters of credit and credit cards  of million compared with million at december  the following table shows the contractual maturities of the company s loans at december  december  dollars in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years total loans commercial real estate construction residential family multifamily commercial installment and other consumer total loans loans with fixed interest rates loans with variable interest rates total loans allowance for credit losses credit risk is inherent in the bank s lending activities 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of potential losses as of the date of the financial statements 
the loan portfolio is regularly reviewed to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  the company estimates losses inherent in all loans and commitments to make loans  and evaluates non performing loans to determine the amount  if any  necessary for a specific reserve 
an important element in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is an analysis of loans by loan risk rating categories 
at a loan s inception and periodically throughout the life of the loan  management evaluates the credit risk by using a risk rating system 
this grading system currently includes eleven levels of risk 
risk ratings range from for the strongest credits to for the weakest 
a rated loan would normally represent a loss 
all loans rated collectively comprise the company s watch list 
the specific grades from are watch list 
table of contents risk rating  special mention risk rating  substandard risk rating  doubtful risk rating  and loss risk rating 
when indicators such as operating losses  collateral impairment or delinquency problems show that a credit may have weakened  the credit will be downgraded as appropriate 
similarly  as borrowers bring loans current  show improved cash flows or improve the collateral position of a loan  the credits may be upgraded 
the result of management s ongoing evaluations and the risk ratings of the portfolio is an allowance with four components specific  general  special  and an amount available for other factors 
specific allowance 
loans on the bank s watch list  as described above  are specifically reviewed and analyzed 
management considers in its analysis expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
when significant conditions or circumstances exist on an individual loan indicating greater risk  a specific allowance may be allocated in addition to the general allowance percentage for that particular risk rating  as outlined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
general allowance 
all loans that do not require a specific allocation are subject to a general allocation based upon historic loss factors 
management determines these factors by analyzing the volume and mix of the existing loan portfolio  in addition to other factors 
management also analyzes the following the volume and severity of non performing loans and adversely classified credits  the level of net charge offs experienced on previously classified loans  the nature and value of collateral securing the loans  and the relationship and trend over the past several years of recoveries in relation to charge offs 
special allowance 
special allowances are established to facilitate changes in the bank s strategy and other factors 
special allocations are to take into consideration various factors that include  but are not limited to effectiveness of credit administration  adequacy of loan review  the adequacy of loan operations personnel and processes  the trend in loan growth and the percentage of change  the level of geographic and or industry concentration  the effect of competitive issues that impact loan underwriting and structure  the impact of economic conditions  including interest rate trends  the introduction of new loan products or special marketing efforts  large credit exposure and trends  and commercial real estate acquisition and development portfolio amounts available for other factors 
management also attempts to ensure that the overall allowance appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of expected credit losses 
the quarterly analysis of specific  general  and special allocations of the allowance is the principal method relied upon by management to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are adjusted on a timely basis 
the inclusion of historical loss factors in the process of determining the general component of the allowance also acts as a self correcting mechanism of management s estimation process  as past and more remote loss experience is replaced by more recent experience 
in its analysis of the specific  general  and special allocations of the allowance  management also considers regulatory guidance in addition to the company s own experience 

table of contents liability for unfunded credit commitments 
management determines the adequacy of the liability for unfunded credit commitments based upon reviews of individual credit facilities  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of commitments and other relevant factors 
the liability is based on estimates  which are evaluated on a regular basis  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in periods in which they become known 
loans and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
draws on unfunded commitments that are considered uncollectible at the time funds are advanced are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for unfunded commitment losses are added to the liability for unfunded commitments  which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs when and if they occur 
the related provision for credit losses that is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined through the above process 
the following table shows the components of the allowance for credit losses at the dates indicated december  december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent general specific special available for other factors total allowance for credit losses management s evaluation of the loan portfolio resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of million at december  and million at december  the increase in the total allowance for credit losses in was primarily due to management s current assessment of economic  market and business conditions  which are noted above under special reserves 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased from on december  to at december  the allowance for loan losses represented of nonperforming loans at december  compared with at december  overall  management believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the best information available 
this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves difficult  subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are uncertain 
therefore  we cannot provide assurance that we will not have sizable credit losses in relation to the amount reserved related to changes in economic  market or business conditions 
such changes could require management to significantly adjust the allowance for credit losses considering factors in existence at that time 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examinations of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for credit losses in future periods if the results of their review warrant it

one of these loans land development  totaling million  was brought current on january  the company  during its normal loan review procedures  considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered to be impaired during a period of minimal delay less than days unless available information strongly suggests impairment 
the bank measures impaired loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes that  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts  and collateral position  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in impaired loans was million and million  respectively 
these loans were evaluated for impairment and it was determined that a specific reserve of  was required at december  no specific reserve was required at december  the average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million respectively 
generally  no interest is accrued on loans when factors indicate collection of interest is doubtful or when principal or interest payments become days past due  unless collection of principal and interest are anticipated within a reasonable period of time and the loans are well secured 
for such loans  previously accrued but uncollected interest is charged against current earnings  and income is only recognized to the extent payments are subsequently received and collection of the remaining recorded principal balance is considered probable

however  with low short term rates  the bank s cost of funds may not decline significantly due to changes in our mix of interest bearing and non interest bearing accounts  growth in higher yielding deposits and competitive pressures 
the company s loan growth in and exceeded its core deposit generation  and the company supplemented its core deposits with certificates of deposits  including brokered deposits  and brokered money market deposits 
in  the company entered into two long term depository relationships that provide the company up to million of money market accounts 
the interest rate on these accounts is based on the daily effective federal funds rate  as published by the federal reserve  plus a spread 
the company s brokered certificates of deposit have maturities ranging from days to five years 
at december   approximately of the company s brokered cds have original maturities of one year or more 
the use of national market brokered cd s is part of the bank s wholesale funding strategy 
of the increase in average time deposits in  brokered cd s and cdars accounted for approximately million and million  respectively 
the company has an agreement with promontory interfinancial network that makes it possible to offer fdic insured deposits in excess of the current deposit limits 
the cdars network uses a deposit matching program to match cdars deposits in other participating banks  dollar for dollar 
this product is designed to enhance our ability to attract and retain customers and increase deposits  by providing additional fdic coverage to customers 
cdars deposits can be reciprocal or one way  and due to the nature of the placement of funds  cdars deposits are defined as brokered deposits by regulatory agencies 
with media focus on the financial sector and customer concern with fdic insurance limits over the past quarter  customer interest in and demand for cdars deposits has increased 
the company s cdars deposits totaled million at december  and million at december  cdars deposits may decline in the future due to the recent increase in fdic insurance limits

the borrowing line with the fhlb permits it to borrow up to of the bank s assets  subject to collateral limitations 
with the collateral available on december   the company believes the bank could borrow up to approximately million 
fhlb borrowings in excess of million would require the company to purchase additional fhlb stock 
at december   the company had only minor amounts of borrowings from the fhlb 
the bank also has access to additional liquidity through the federal reserve s primary credit program

in the fourth quarter of  the holding company contributed million to the bank to enhance its capital position 
the company has and may also continue to preserve capital by slowing new loan commitments  participating out additional loans  selling assets  including loans  to reduce its risk weighted assets  and continuing the company s position of paying no cash dividends to shareholders 
the degree to which and the duration of time during which the company may take steps to preserve and increase its capital will depend on several factors including general economic and real estate market conditions in the pacific northwest  the company s ability to raise additional capital  regulatory considerations  and the company s ability to manage and limit the adverse effects of losses on existing loans 
to raise additional capital  the company may offer and issue equity  hybrid equity or debt instruments  including convertible preferred stock or subordinated debt 
the company may participate in any government programs that become available to it 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may not be available or terms that are favorable to current shareholders or even acceptable to the company 
in september  the company announced a stock repurchase program for up to  shares 
under the program  the company intended to use existing funds to finance any repurchases 
when evaluating timing and amount of common stock repurchases  management considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  projected earnings generation  risk weighted asset growth  capital ratios relative to regulatory capital guidelines  availability and cost of other capital resources and the market valuation of its stock price

the company s primary sources of funds are customer deposits  loan payments  maturities and sales of investments and loans  borrowings from the fhlb or federal reserve and the use of the federal funds market 
as of december   approximately million of the securities portfolio matures within one year  but all securities are classified as available for sale 
other potential sources of funds include lines of credit with correspondent banks and brokered time deposits 
deposits are the primary source of new funds 
total deposits were million at december  compared with million at december  government programs such as the fdic s transaction account guarantee program tagp may influence deposit behaviors 
under this program  effective october  through december   all accounts and certain now accounts are fully guaranteed by the fdic for the entire amount in the account 
the bank participates in this program at an additional cost to the bank 
deposits maintained at the bank are insured by the fdic up to  per account owner through december  on january   the standard coverage limits are scheduled to return to  for all deposit categories except individual retirement accounts and certain other retirement accounts  which will continue to be insured up to  per account owner 
the company maintains a borrowing line with the federal home loan bank fhlb limited to of the bank s assets  or million based on the bank s assets at december   subject to certain collateral limitations 
the company can utilize the line for long term borrowings or to meet temporary funding needs with overnight advances 
as discussed in borrowings  the company is under a blanket bond collateral agreement 
the company s practice is to pledge certain securities with the fhlb against its borrowing line 
to obtain the maximum amount of borrowing capacity  the bank would pledge loans in addition to securities 
at december   the company had outstanding advances of  and a million letter of credit 
the bank also has access to additional liquidity through the federal reserve s primary credit program 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
as of december   the holding company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
substantially all of the parent company s revenues are obtained from dividends paid by the bank and proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities  which is used for various corporate purposes  such as interest payments on junior subordinated debentures  operating expenses and stock repurchases 
trust preferred securities are not expected to be a source of liquidity for the holding company in  given current market conditions 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
based on information available to management at this time  we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to meet its cash obligations in the near term  which consist principally of debt service on the million of outstanding junior subordinated debentures

impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
management believes that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on the ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
management has an asset liability program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
the financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires the bank to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the bank s control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the principal purpose of asset liability management is to manage the company s sources and uses of funds to maximize net interest income under different interest rate conditions with minimal risk 
a key component of the asset liability management is the measurement of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the volatility in earnings resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  variability in spread relationships  and the mismatch of re pricing intervals between assets and liabilities 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable time frame  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
the policy of the company is to control the exposure of the company s earnings to changing interest rates by generally maintaining a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral or balanced position 
the board of directors has established guidelines for maintaining the company s earnings risk due to future interest rate changes 
this analysis provides an indication of the company s earnings risk due to future interest rate changes 
at december   the analysis indicated that the earnings risk was within the company s policy guidelines 

table of contents the following table presents interest rate sensitivity data at december  interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
since these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not be reflective of the company s interest rate view in subsequent periods 
active management dictates that longer term economic views are balanced against the prospects of short term interest rate changes in all re pricing intervals 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  dollars in thousands three months or less three months through six months six months through one year one year through five years after years total interest earning assets temporary investments investments available for sale federal home loan bank stock loans  net of deferred loan fees total interest earning assets allowance for loan losses noninterest bearing cash and due from banks bank owned life insurance other assets total assets interest bearing liabilities savings  money market and interest bearing demand deposits certificates of deposit junior subordinated debentures other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities demand deposits other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a percent of earning assets mortgage backed securities  which are not due at a single maturity date  have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the expected maturity of the underlying loan collateral certain investment securities have call options which  if exercised  may cause the actual maturities to differ from the stated contractual maturities 
table of contents market risk interest rate and credit risks are the most significant market risks impacting the company s performance 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company relies on loan reviews  prudent loan underwriting standards and an adequate allowance for credit losses to mitigate credit risk 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s gap position see asset liability management interest rate sensitivity and sensitivity to interest rate risk by subjecting the company s balance sheet to hypothetical interest rate shocks 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability position to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company utilizes asset liability modeling software to determine the effect of a shift in market interest rates  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points 
the model utilized to create the table presented below is based on the concept that all rates do not move by the same amount or at the same time 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled payments on the adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase due to adjustments in the amount of the payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the gaps between assets and liabilities 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change and each category of asset liability  and the amount of any change in the federal funds rate 
local market conditions and the strategy of the company determine the weights for loan and core deposits  while national markets set the other weights 
in addition  a timing factor has been used as fixed rate instruments do not re price immediately  renewals may have different terms than original maturities  and the timing of changes for each type of instrument varies for example  core deposit re pricing usually occurs sometime after a change in the federal funds rate  but variable rate loans re price immediately with changes to the company s prime interest rate 
due to the various assumptions used for this simulation analysis  no assurance can be given that actual results will correspond with projected results 
the following table shows the estimated impact on the bank s net interest income over a time horizon of one year from the base case and the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates as of december  for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
dollars in thousands increase decrease in net interest income from base scenario percentage change in net interest income increase decrease in present value of equity percentage change in present value of equity up basis points up basis points down basis points n m n m n m n m down basis points n m n m n m n m loans and certificates of deposit represent the majority of interest rate exposure 
historically  savings and interest bearing checking accounts have not re priced in proportion to changes in overall market interest rates 
changes in net interest income can generally be attributed to the balance of loans and certificates of deposit maturing or re pricing 
to reduce the bank s asset sensitive position  the bank entered into an interest rate 
table of contents contract that floors the yield on million of variable rate loans at 
in addition  the bank has entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange variable prime based payments for fixed rate payments ranging from to on million of variable rate loans 
in management s judgment as of december   the interest rate risk profile of the bank is reasonably balanced within the most likely range of possible outcomes 
as shown in the table above  the company s balance sheet has become slightly liability sensitive through the basis point scenario at december  however  with the more dramatic change reflected in the declining scenarios  management views this scenario highly unlikely given the current low rate environment with the current federal funds rate at basis points 
the change in fair values of financial assets is mainly a result of loans representing of total interest earning assets at december  as a percentage of total loans  million  or approximately  have fixed interest rates that decline in value during a period of rising interest rates 
while asset liability models have become a main focus of risk management  the company believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling risk 
the quantitative risk information provided is limited by the parameters established in creating the related models 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which the company could take to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected or competitive influences on the company s deposit base 
therefore  the company uses these models only as a supplement to other risk management tools
