these starches are principally ethylated chemically modified with ethylene oxide  oxidized treated with sodium hypochlorite and cationic carrying a positive electrical charge 
ethylated and oxidized starches are used in coatings and as binders  providing strength and printability to fine white  magazine and catalog paper 
cationic and other liquid starches are generally used in the paper forming process in paper production  providing strong bonding of paper fibers and other ingredients 
several of industrial ingredients products are cost effective alternatives to synthetic  petroleum based ingredients 
in may  the company s industrial ingredients north america segment began commercial production and sales of ethanol from its facility in cedar rapids  iowa

discontinued operations on august   the company s board of directors made a determination that the company would exit from the business conducted by the company s australia new zealand operations 
this determination was the completion of a process  announced on february   involving an examination of a range of strategic and operating choices for the company s australia new zealand operations as part of a continuing program to maximize the company s asset values and returns 
on september   the company completed the sale of 
table of contents penford new zealand limited 
on november   the company s australian operating subsidiary  penford australia limited  executed two asset sale agreements with unrelated parties to sell substantially all of its operating assets 
the completion and timing of these transactions remain subject to risks and uncertainties 
the australia new zealand operations developed  manufactured and marketed ingredient systems  including specialty starches and sweeteners for food and industrial applications 
until september   the company operated a corn wet milling facility in auckland  new zealand 
the company continues to operate a corn wet milling facility in lane cove  australia and a wheat starch manufacturing facility in tamworth  australia 
these facilities are covered by the asset sale agreements noted above 
the financial data for the australia new zealand operations have been presented as discontinued operations 
the financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
accordingly  for all periods presented herein  the consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows have been conformed to this presentation 
the australia new zealand operations was previously reported as the company s third operating segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
unless otherwise noted  all amounts  analyses and discussions are based on continuing operations 
raw materials corn penford s north american corn wet milling plant is located in cedar rapids  iowa  the middle of the us corn belt 
accordingly  the plant has truck delivered corn available throughout the year from a number of suppliers at prices consistent with those available in the major us grain markets 
potato starch the company s facilities in idaho falls  idaho  richland  washington  and plover  wisconsin use starch recovered as by products from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture modified potato starches 
the company enters into contracts typically having durations of one to three years with potato processors in the united states and canada to acquire potato based raw materials 
chemicals the primary chemicals used in the manufacturing processes are readily available commodity chemicals 
the prices for these chemicals are subject to price fluctuations due to market conditions 
natural gas the primary energy source for most of penford s plants is natural gas 
penford contracts its natural gas supply with regional suppliers  generally under short term supply agreements  and regularly uses futures contracts to hedge the price of natural gas 
corn  potato starch  chemicals and natural gas are not currently subject to availability constraints  however  demand for these items can significantly affect the prices 
penford s current potato starch requirements constitute a material portion of the available north american supply 
penford estimates that it purchases approximately of the recovered potato starch in north america 
it is possible that  in the long term  continued growth in demand for potato starch based ingredients and new product development could result in capacity constraints 
over half of the company s manufacturing costs consist of the costs of corn  potato starch  chemicals and natural gas 
the remaining portion consists of the costs of labor  distribution  depreciation and maintenance of manufacturing plant and equipment  and other utilities 
the prices of raw materials may fluctuate  and increases in prices may affect penford s business adversely 
to mitigate this risk  penford hedges a portion of corn and gas purchases with futures and options contracts in the us and enters into short term supply agreements for other production requirements

specialty starch ingredient brand names for industrial applications include  among others  penford gums  pensize binders  penflex sizing agent  topcat cationic additive and the apollo starch series 
product brand names for food ingredient applications include penbind  pencling and penplus 
quarterly fluctuations penford s revenues and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
sales volumes of the food ingredients north america products used in french fry coatings are generally lower during penford s second fiscal quarter due to decreased consumption of french fries during the post holiday season 
the cost of natural gas in north america is generally higher in the winter months than the summer months 
working capital the company s growth is funded through a combination of cash flows from operations and short and long term borrowings

item a risk factors risks related to penford s business the availability and cost of agricultural products penford purchases are vulnerable to weather and other factors beyond its control 
the company s ability to pass through cost increases for these products is limited by worldwide competition and other factors 
in fiscal  approximately of penford s manufacturing costs were the costs of corn  potato starch and other agricultural raw materials 
weather conditions  plantings  government programs and policies  and energy costs and global supply  among other things  have historically caused volatility in the supply and prices of these agricultural products 
due to local and or international competition  the company may not be able to pass through the increases in the cost of agricultural raw materials to its customers 
to manage price volatility in the commodity markets  the company may purchase inventory in advance or enter into exchange traded futures or options contracts 
despite these hedging activities  the company may not be successful in limiting its exposure to market fluctuations in the cost of agricultural raw materials 
increases in the cost of corn  potato starch and other agricultural raw materials due to weather conditions or other factors beyond penford s control and that cannot be passed through to customers will reduce penford s future profitability 
increases in energy and chemical costs may reduce penford s profitability 
energy and chemicals comprised approximately and  respectively  of the cost of manufacturing the company s products in fiscal penford uses natural gas extensively in its industrial ingredients business to dry starch products  and  to a lesser extent  in the food ingredients business 
the company uses chemicals in all of the businesses to modify starch for specific product applications and customer requirements 
the prices of these inputs to the manufacturing process fluctuate based on anticipated changes in supply and demand  weather and the prices of alternative fuels  including petroleum 
the company may use short term purchase contracts or exchange traded futures or option contracts to reduce the price volatility of natural gas  however  these strategies are not available for the chemicals the company purchases 
if the company is unable to pass on increases in energy and chemical costs to its customers  margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on penford s results of operations 
the company s sales of ethanol to its sole ethanol customer  eco energy  inc  represented approximately of the company s net sales for fiscal year eco energy  inc is a marketer and distributor of bio fuels in the united states and canada 
the company s second largest customer  domtar  inc  represented approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales to the top ten customers represented and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
generally  the company does not have multi year sales agreements with its customers 
many customers place orders on an 
table of contents as needed basis and generally can change their suppliers without penalty 
if penford lost one or more major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly reduced its orders  sales and results of operations would be adversely affected 
the company is substantially dependent on its manufacturing facilities  any operational disruption could result in a reduction of the company s sales volumes and could cause it to incur substantial losses 
penford s revenues are  and will continue to be  derived from the sale of starch based ingredients and ethanol that the company manufactures at its facilities 
the company s operations may be subject to significant interruption if any of its facilities experiences a major accident or is damaged by severe weather or other natural disasters  as occurred as a result of the flood of the cedar river at the company s cedar rapids  iowa facility in fiscal in addition  the company s operations may be subject to labor disruptions and unscheduled downtime  or other operational hazards inherent in the industry  such as equipment failures  fires  explosions  abnormal pressures  blowouts  pipeline ruptures  transportation accidents and natural disasters 
some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
the company s insurance may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above or that it will be able to renew this insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the agreements governing the company s debt contain various covenants that limit its ability to take certain actions and also require the company to meet financial maintenance tests  and penford s failure to comply with any of the debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the agreements governing penford s outstanding debt contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  limit its ability to incur additional debt or liens  consolidate or merge with any person or transfer or sell all or substantially all of its assets  make investments or acquisitions  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and create dividend or other payment restrictions with respect to subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility requires it to comply with specific financial ratios and tests  under which it is required to achieve specific financial and operating results 
events beyond the company s control may affect its ability to comply with these provisions 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under the company s revolving credit facility 
in the event of any default that is not cured or waived  the company s lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with accrued interest thereon  due and payable  which could permit acceleration of other debt 
if any of the company s debt is accelerated  there is no assurance that the company would have sufficient assets to repay that debt or that it would be able to refinance that debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
changes in interest rates may affect penford s profitability 
although the company has fixed the interest rates on a significant portion of its outstanding debt through interest rate swaps as of august   approximately million of its outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates which move in direct relation to the united states or australian london interbank offered rate libor  or the prime rate in the united states  depending on the selection of borrowing options 
any significant changes in these interest rates would materially affect the company s profitability by increasing or decreasing its borrowing costs 

table of contents unanticipated changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect penford s profitability 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and  until the operations are divested  the company is also subject to income taxes in australia and new zealand 
the company s effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the united states  is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
although the company believes it has complied with all applicable income tax laws  there is no assurance that a tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law or that any additional taxes imposed as a result of tax audits will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
fluctuations in the relative value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect penford s revenues and profitability 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates 
the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies has been generally in decline in recent years 
the company s revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies 
pension expense and the funding of pension obligations are affected by factors outside the company s control  including the performance of plan assets  interest rates  actuarial data and experience  and changes in laws and regulations 
the future funding obligations for the company s two us defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service depend upon the level of benefits provided for by the plans  the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans  the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels  actuarial data and experience and any changes in government laws and regulations 
the pension plans hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities 
when the values of these securities decline  pension expense can increase and materially affect the company s results 
decreases in interest rates that are not offset by contributions and asset returns could also increase the company s obligations under such plans 
the company is legally required to make contributions to the pension plans in the future  and those contributions could be material 
the company expects to contribute million to its pension plans during fiscal penford s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other contingencies 
the company faces risks arising from litigation matters in which various factors or developments can lead to changes in current estimates of liabilities  such as final adverse judgments  significant settlements or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse outcome  ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
the current capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect the company s access to capital  cost of capital and business operations 
the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital 
if these conditions continue or become worse  the company s future cost of debt and equity capital and its access to capital markets could be adversely affected 
any inability to obtain adequate financing from debt and equity sources could force the company to self fund strategic initiatives or even forgo some opportunities  potentially harming its financial position  results of operations and liquidity 

table of contents economic conditions may impair the businesses of the company s customers and end user markets  which could adversely affect the company s business operations 
as a result of the current economic downturn and macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  the businesses of some of the company s customers may not be successful in generating sufficient revenues 
customers may choose to delay or postpone purchases from the company until the economy and their businesses strengthen 
in this connection  the company s industrial ingredients business is dependent upon end markets for paper and ethanol in north america 
paper markets have been under competitive pressure from imports and over capacity and may be further stressed by an economic downturn 
ethanol markets have been under pressure from declining oil prices and increasing ethanol production capacity in the united states 
decisions by current or future customers to forego or defer purchases and or customers inability to pay the company for its products may adversely affect the company s earnings and cash flow 
penford depends on its senior management team  the loss of any member could adversely affect its operations 
penford s success depends on the management and leadership skills of its senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals  particularly thomas d 
malkoski  the company s president and chief executive officer  or steven o 
cordier  the company s chief financial officer  or the company s inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel  could prevent it from fully implementing its business strategy 
there is no assurance that it will be able to retain its existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
penford is subject to stringent environmental and health and safety laws  which may require it to incur substantial compliance and remediation costs  thereby reducing profits 
penford is subject to many federal  state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the use  handling  treatment  storage  discharge and disposal of substances and hazardous wastes used or generated in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the company s business 
penford has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
the company s failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
the company may be required to incur costs relating to the investigation or remediation of property  including property where it has disposed of its waste  and for addressing environmental conditions 
some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
consequently  there is no assurance that existing or future circumstances  the development of new facts or the failure of third parties to address contamination at current or former facilities or properties will not require significant expenditures by the company 
the company expects to continue to be subject to increasingly stringent environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
it is difficult to predict the future interpretation and development of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or their impact on the company s future earnings and operations 
the company anticipates that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
any increase in these costs  or unanticipated liabilities arising  for example  out of discovery of previously unknown conditions or more aggressive enforcement actions  could adversely affect the company s results of operations  and there is no assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations
