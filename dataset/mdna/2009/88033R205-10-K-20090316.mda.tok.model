liquidity and capital resources on june   the company closed a  revolving senior credit facility between the company and citibank texas  na citibank 
under the facility  loans and letters of credit were available to the company on a revolving basis in an amount outstanding not to exceed the lesser of  or the borrowing base in effect from time to time 
on december   citibank assigned the company s revolving credit facility with citibank to sovereign bank of dallas  texas sovereign as requested by the company 
under the facility as assigned to sovereign  loans and letters of credit are available to the company on a revolving basis in an amount outstanding not to exceed the lesser of million or the company s borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the sovereign facility is secured by substantially all of the company s producing and non producing oil and gas properties and pipeline and the company s methane project assets 
the company s initial borrowing base with sovereign was set at million  an increase from its borrowing base of million with citibank prior to the assignment 
on june   the company entered into an amendment to its credit facility with sovereign whereby the company s borrowing base was increased by the bank as a result of its review of the company s currently owned producing properties 
the borrowing base was raised to million effective june  the company has previously utilized about million of the facility  leaving approximately million available for use by the company upon this borrowing base increase 
the company used million of the then available million for the purchase of the riffe field properties in kansas 
the total borrowing by the company under the facility at year end and as of the date of this report is million 
effective february   the company amended its credit facility with sovereign to provide for a monthly reduction of the bank s commitment by  per month for the five month period of february through june this commitment reduction is not a cash payment obligation of the company but has the effect of reducing the company s available borrowing base in monthly increments of  so that by june the company s available borrowing base under the sovereign facility will be reduced by  from million to million 
the company s borrowing base will be redetermined at the next regularly scheduled borrowing base review on june  at that time  the borrowing base is subject to be redetermined according to the parameters established by sovereign and applied to all of its borrowers 
although the company has not been required as of the date of this report to make any payment on principal to sovereign bank under the borrowing base in effect at any time  the company can make no assurance that in view of the current conditions in the national and world economies  including the realistic possibility of continued low commodity prices being received for the company s oil and gas production for extended periods  that sovereign may in the future make a redetermination of the company s borrowing base to a point below the level of the company s current borrowing 
in such an event  the company may be called upon to make installment or other payments in such amount and at such times to sovereign in order to reduce the principal of the company s outstanding borrowing to a level not in excess of the borrowing base as it may be redetermined 
although the year ended in challenging fashion  during the entire year the company remained focused on production and carefully used its cash flows and available credit to do so 
however  the company can make no assurance that it can continue normal operations indefinitely or for any specific period of time in the event of extended periods of low commodity prices or upon the occurrence of any significant downturn or losses in operations 
in such event  the company may be required to reduce costs of operations by various means  including not undertaking certain maintenance or reworking operations that may be necessary to keep some of the company s properties in production or to seek additional working capital by additional means such as issuance of equity including preferred stock or such other means as may be considered and authorized by the company s board of directors from time to time

actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold and delivered to its customers 
natural gas meters are placed at the customers location and usage is billed each month 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the purchasers  revenues are recognized 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  day rate rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
the capitalized oil and gas property  less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  if any  are generally limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices in effect as of the balance sheet date with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions  and b the cost of investments in unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized 
no ceiling write downs were recorded in and however  in the company incurred a ceiling limitation write down in the amount of  due to the dramatically lower year end oil prices in as compared to and the resulting significant downward adjustment of the company s estimated proved reserves 
the effect of the ceiling write down resulted in the company recording a net income in of  despite having an operating profit in of  before the ceiling test write down 
oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  were determined by laroche petroleum consultants  ltd 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures includes many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company is required to record the effects of contractual or other legal obligations on well abandonments for capping and plugging wells 
management periodically reviews the estimate of the timing of the wells closure as well as the estimated closing costs  discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate of 
quarterly  management accretes the discount into the liability and makes other adjustments to the liability for well retirements incurred during the period 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement 
fin provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority 
the assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position  without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged 
if an uncertain tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely to be recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority  is recorded 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
consistent with the requirements of fin  we adopted fin on january  the adoption of fin had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the company currently has open tax return periods beginning with december  through december  in september  the securities and exchange commission staff published staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements  specifically  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the company adopted sab in the fourth quarter of adoption did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued no 
sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurement 
under the standard  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
it clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted sfas effective january  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities as amended sfas 
sfas permits entities to elect to report eligible financial instruments at fair value subject to conditions stated in the pronouncement including adoption of sfas discussed above 
the purpose of sfas is to improve financial reporting by mitigating volatility in earnings related to current reporting requirements 
the company considered the applicability of sfas and determined not to adopt it at this time 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company did not enter into any hedging agreements in to limit exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately  including  as of that date   owed on its credit facility with sovereign bank 
the interest rate on the credit facility is variable at a rate equal to libor plus with a floor of 
the company s remaining debt of  has fixed interest rates ranging from to 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs in fluctuated based on short term interest rates on approximately of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on interest expense and the company s cash flows of a percent increase in the interest rate on the sovereign bank credit facility would be approximately  assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of december  the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
