executive overview the following overview does not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of this item or other items in this report or contain all of the information that may be important to our stockholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this item and this report 
cardium s business is focused on the acquisition and strategic development of product opportunities or businesses having the potential to address significant unmet medical needs  and definable pathways to commercialization  partnering or other monetization following the achievement of corresponding development objectives 
consistent with our overall business strategy  as our product opportunities and businesses are advanced and corresponding valuations established  we intend to consider various corporate development transactions designed to place our product candidates into larger organizations or with partners having existing commercialization  sales and marketing resources  and a need for innovative products 
such transactions could involve the sale  partnering or other monetization of particular product opportunities or businesses 
to that end  during the year ended december   we i advanced our phase b clinical trial matrix to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tissue repair s product candidate  excellarate  for the potential treatment of non healing diabetic foot ulcers  ii completed the development and regulatory approval of innercool s next generation rapidblue endovascular system  iii advanced the use of innercool s new coolblue surface temperature modulation system and developed a new tissue targeted cooling system  urocool  for potential use in conjunction with prostate surgery  iv advanced studies of our generx clinical candidate and our corgentin preclinical candidate for the potential treatment of cardiovascular disease  and v supported studies funded by governmental authorities in the united states and sweden designed to evaluate potential additional applications of innercool s therapeutic hypothermia technology in the areas of stroke and heart attack 
as a development stage company  our revenues are generally limited to those generated by the sale of innercool s endovascular system  rapidblue system and its coolblue surface temperature modulation system 
we do not have any other products available for sale or use 
because of the limited nature of our revenues and the high costs we must incur to develop our product candidates  we have yet to generate positive cash flows or income from operations and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are currently dependent on debt and equity funding to finance our operations 
going forward  the key elements of our strategy are to complete the phase b clinical study for excellarate  accelerate the commercialization of innercool s therapeutic hypothermia technology and products and continue to develop additional products and applications  evaluate partnering opportunities designed to support the advancement of the generx and corgentin product candidates  
table of contents broaden and expand our product base and financial resources through other corporate development transactions in an attempt to enhance stockholder value  which could include acquiring other medical related companies or product opportunities and or securing additional capital  and monetize the economic value of our product portfolio by establishing strategic collaborations and selling businesses and assets at appropriate valuation inflection points 
we recognize that the practical realities of developing therapeutic products and devices in the current regulatory environment require sizable financial investment 
in view of this  we plan to pursue clinical development strategies intended to facilitate collaborations and partnerships for joint development of our products at appropriate valuation inflection points during their clinical development cycle 
more detailed information about our products  product candidates  our intended efforts to develop our products and our business strategy is included under item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included under item in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes 
we have identified certain policies such as the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory allowance  the useful lives of fixed assets  the valuation of intangible assets and the accrued expense estimates  that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an adverse effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal product sales for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase in product sales during was due in large part to an increase in sales of innercool therapies celsius control system resulting from our expanded sales and marketing efforts at innercool therapies  as well as new sales from the launch of innercool therapies coolblue system in late tissue repair company generated  in grant revenue during the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the  decrease was directly attributable to the level of activity expended on the grant 
during the primary focus was on the excellarate clinical research study 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  in cost of goods sold was directly related to the increase in revenues from the sale of innercool therapies products  which accounted for a significant portion of our revenues offset by our  reversal of the obsolescence reserve associated with the celsius control console based on its new application to support our organ cooling system urocool 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  was primarily due to a reduction in the development costs for innercool s rapidblue product as it moved from development to production  and 
table of contents increased expenses in our efforts to advance our excellarate product candidate in its phase b clinical trial  offset by reductions in generx aware phase clinical trial costs as spending in the year ended december  included product material and initial start up costs not required in in addition we recorded a  reversal of research and development bonuses that were accrued at the end of and not paid 
as of december   the company recorded a liability for discretionary employee and officer bonuses for past performance 
the payment of such bonuses was expected to take place sometime in given the ongoing difficulties in the financial markets  which made it more challenging and expensive for companies to raise funds  the compensation committee of our board of directors felt it appropriate to forego the planned payment of these bonuses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly due to decreases in payroll and payroll related cost with the reversal of  in administrative bonuses that were accrued at the end of and not paid  as explained above  and a significant reduction in our head count in the fourth quarter of as we moved towards strategic distribution relationships 
we derive interest income from the investment of our available cash in various short term obligations  such as certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market funds 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the  decrease in interest income for the year when compared to the same period last year was directly related to the decrease in cash available for investment as we used the proceeds from our commercial credit facility  equity financings and debt financing to fund operations 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase was a result of our commercial credit facility with life sciences capital llc  which was paid off in july  and our secured debt financing in november fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for the year ended december  were  of which innercool therapies generated  compared to  for the year ended december  our increase in revenues during was due in large part to an increase in sales of innercool therapies celsius control system resulting from our expanded sales and marketing efforts at innercool therapies  as well as new sales from the launch of innercool therapies coolblue system in late and the timing of our acquisition of innercool therapies in march before march  we had no products available for sale or use and thus the amount for reflects only ten months of revenues 
in addition  tissue repair company generated  in grant revenue during the year ended december   compared to  during the five months of following our acquisition of tissue repair company in august cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold was directly related to the increase in revenues from the sale of innercool therapies products  which accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase of million over last year was primarily due to our efforts to i advance our lead product candidate  generx  to a phase clinical trial aware  ii develop and launch a next generation console for the celsius control system  and iii advance our excellarate product candidate to a phase b clinical study 
in the first half of  we classified our clinical staff as general and administrative expense  as during that time the staff was focused on the technology transfer from schering ag group  germany 
as our clinical staff has transitioned to development activities and clinical studies for our product candidates  as of july   their related expenses were included in research and development 
because we did not acquire innercool therapies and its celsius control system until march  research and 
table of contents development expenses for the year ended december  included only ten months of expenses related to innercool therapies and the development of its products 
similarly  due to the timing of the tissue repair company acquisition in august  research and development expenses for the year ended december  included only four and a half months of expenses related to the development of tissue repair company s products 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to increased expenses related to our acquisitions of innercool therapies and tissue repair company and our expanded sales and marketing efforts at innercool  partially offset by the reclassification of our clinical staff expenses from selling  general and administrative to research and development as discussed above 
amortization expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  our amortization expenses were in connection with our acquisition of innercool therapies as we recorded patented technology and other intangibles at the time of purchase 
the increase of  in compared to the previous year was due to the timing of the innercool acquisition in march and the inclusion of only ten months of amortization in we derive interest income from the investment of our available cash in various short term obligations  such as certificates of deposit  commercial paper and money market funds 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the  decrease in interest income for the year when compared to the same period last year was directly related to the decrease in cash available for investment as we used the proceeds from our october private placement to fund operations  partially offset by the investment of the proceeds received from the private placement we completed in march liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from financing activities and in particular proceeds from the sale of our common stock and our debt financing 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   and was primarily derived from proceeds we received from the sale of our common stock and debt financing  net of issuance costs 
for the period december  inception to december   net cash provided by financing activities was  net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period last year 
for the period december  inception to december   net cash used in operating activities was  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was a result of the increase in our accounts payable  depreciation and amortization expense 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the purchase of in process technology from tissue repair company offset by a reduction in the purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the period december  inception to december  was  since inception  our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash and we have had only limited revenues 
we anticipate the negative cash flow from operations will continue because our product development and other costs  including significant amounts we expect to spend on development activities and clinical trials for excellarate and other product candidates  cannot be offset by our limited revenues during our development stage 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  and our cash and cash equivalents were approximately million 
to date  we have generated limited revenues  consisting of revenues from sales of our innercool celsius control system  rapidblue system  coolblue system and associated disposables  grant revenue  as well as interest income 
a large portion of our expenses are fixed  including expenses related to facilities  equipment  contractual commitments and personnel 
as a result  we expect our net losses from operations to continue for at least the next five years 
our ability to generate additional revenues and potential to become profitable will depend largely on our ability  alone or with potential 
table of contents collaborators  to efficiently and successfully complete the development of our product candidates  successfully complete pre clinical and clinical tests  obtain necessary regulatory approvals  and manufacture and market our products 
there can be no assurance that any such events will occur or that we will ever become profitable 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot predict the level of such profitability 
if we sustain losses over an extended period of time  we may be unable to continue our business 
on march  we completed a subordinated secured debt financing for which we received proceeds of approximately million before placement agent fees and offering expenses 
with the completion of our recent debt offering  we believe we will be able to fund required operations for approximately the next three months  not including efforts to accelerate the study of our excellarate and generx product candidates and actively promote the launches of innercool s coolblue and rapidblue product lines 
as a result  we will need to raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities  debt financings  strategic licensing agreements and or other corporate transactions 
if we do not raise such funds  we will not be able to accelerate our product development activities or maintain operations 
management has been in discussions to raise additional funds but there is no assurance we will succeed in these efforts 
if we are not successful in obtaining additional funds  we will need to scale back our operations and or sell or partner certain development projects or products  or our operations may not be able to continue as planned or at all 
the previously described conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
for these reasons  our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   contain a going concern qualification from our independent registered public accounting firm  marcum kliegman llp 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets or classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses material to investors 
as of december   we had operating lease obligations of approximately  extending through contractual obligations the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases total obligations recent accounting pronouncements in april   the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fas

 business combinations  and other applicable accounting literature 
this fsp will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december

we are currently evaluating the effect  if any  of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp determining fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active fsp 
fsp classified the application of sfas no 
in an inactive market 
it demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued

 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary previously referred to as minority interests

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
the fasb has indicated it believes that sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas and sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

for items within its scope  fsp sfas defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is required to adopt the pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal the company does not believe that the impact of the adoption of this fsp will be material to its financial position and results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for determining how an enterprise recognizes and measures the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including non controlling interests  contingent consideration  and certain acquired contingencies 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
sfas r will be applicable prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas r would have an impact on accounting for any businesses acquired after the effective date of this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a limited level of market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  due to the investment of our available cash in various instruments 
the goal of our investment activities is to preserve principal while seeking to increase income received on our investments without significantly increasing risk 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
we generally do not  however  enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or to 
table of contents otherwise manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
generally  we seek to limit our exposure to risk by investing substantially in short term  investment grade securities  such as commercial paper  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
the amount of interest income we receive on our investments will vary with changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  generally decreasing as interest rates decrease and increasing as interest rates increase 
while we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or other market risks or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  due to the short term  investment grade nature of our investments  we do not believe our exposure to market risk from our investments is material
