overview we are one of the largest distributors of residential and non residential roofing materials in the united states and canada 
we are also a distributor of other building materials  including siding  windows  specialty lumber products and waterproofing systems for residential and nonresidential building exteriors 
we purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors and  to a lesser extent  general contractors  retailers and building material suppliers 
we carry up to  skus through branches in the united states and canada 
in fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were in the united states 
we stock one of the most extensive assortments of high quality branded products in the industry  enabling us to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
execution of the operating plan at each of our branches drives our financial results 
revenues are impacted by the relative strength of the residential and non residential roofing markets we serve 
we allow each of our branches to develop its own marketing plan and mix of products based upon its local market 
we differentiate ourselves from the competition by providing customer services  including job site delivery  tapered insulation layouts and design and metal fabrication  and by providing credit 
we consider customer relations and our employees knowledge of roofing and exterior building materials to be important to our ability to increase customer loyalty and maintain customer satisfaction 
we invest significant resources in training our employees in sales techniques  management skills and product knowledge 
while we consider these attributes important drivers of our business  we continually pay close attention to controlling operating costs 
our growth strategy includes both internal growth opening new branches  growing sales with existing customers  adding new customers and introducing new products and acquisition growth 
our main acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that we presently do not serve 
our april acquisition of north coast commercial roofing systems  inc is an example of this approach 
north coast is a leading distributor of commercial roofing systems and related accessories  based in twinsburg  ohio  which had locations in ohio  illinois  indiana  kentucky  michigan  new york  pennsylvania and west virginia at the time of the acquisition 
there was minimal branch overlap with our existing operations 
we also have acquired smaller companies to supplement branch openings within an existing region 
our may acquisition of wholesale roofing supply wrs  a single location distributor of residential and commercial roofing products located in knoxville  tennessee  which we integrated into our best distributing region in the carolinas  is an example of such an acquisition 

table of contents general we sell all materials necessary to install  replace and repair residential and non residential roofs  including shingles  single ply roofing  metal roofing and accessories  modified bitumen  built up roofing  insulation  slate and tile  fasteners  coatings and cements  and other roofing accessories 
we also sell complementary building products such as vinyl siding  doors  windows and millwork  wood and fiber cement siding  residential insulation  and waterproofing systems

percentages may not total due to rounding 
year ended september  september  september  net sales mix net sales mix net sales mix residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products we have over  customers  none of which represents more than of our net sales 
many of our customers are small to mid size contractors with relatively limited capital resources 
we maintain strict credit approval and review policies  which has helped to keep losses from customer receivables within our expectations 
for the seven years prior to  bad debts averaged approximately of net sales 
in and  we experienced increases to and of net sales  respectively  which is still within our tolerances in consideration of the tougher economic and credit climate 
our expenses consist primarily of the cost of products purchased for resale  labor  fleet  occupancy  and selling and administrative expenses 
we compete for business and may respond to competitive pressures at times by lowering prices in order to maintain our market share 
in september  we amended our by laws to change our year end date to september of each fiscal year 
prior to that amendment  we used a week fiscal year ending on the last saturday of september 
our fiscal years ended september   september   and september  all contained weeks 
since  we have made seventeen strategic and complementary acquisitions and opened new branches 
we opened eight branches in  one in and three in we slowed the pace of new branch openings beginning in  mostly as a result of the slowdown in our business experienced 
table of contents since typically  when we open a new branch  we transfer a certain level of existing business from an existing branch to the new branch 
this allows the new branch to commence with a base business and also allows the existing branch to target other growth opportunities 
in managing our business  we consider all growth  including the opening of new branches  to be internal growth unless it is a result of an acquisition 
in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  when we refer to growth in existing markets  we include growth from existing and newly opened branches but exclude growth from acquired branches until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the reporting period 
our average annual internal sales growth over the five fiscal years since our ipo was 
results of operations the following discussion compares our results of operations for  and the following table shows  for the periods indicated  information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods presented 
percentages may not total due to rounding 
year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income compared to net sales consolidated net sales decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in for  all of our sales were considered to be from existing market as we did not acquire any branches in or the product group sales for and were as follows percentages may not total due to rounding change dollars in millions net sales mix net sales mix residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products 
table of contents our sales were affected primarily by the following factors  most of which resulted from tougher economic conditions significant decline in non residential roofing activity  continued weakness in new residential roofing activity in most markets  continued weak complementary product sales in most markets  and six fewer branches for most of the year  partially offset by the positive impact of higher average year over year prices  especially in residential roofing products  and increased re roofing activity in the areas affected by hurricane ike  primarily in our southwest region 
we estimate inflation increased this year s sales by over last year  indicating a drop in volume of  mostly in non residential roofing and complementary product sales 
we opened three new branches late in and closed six branches during the year 
we had business days in both and net sales by geographical region grew or declined as follows northeast  mid atlantic  southeast  southwest  midwest  west  and canada 
these variations were primarily caused by short term factors such as local economic conditions and storm activity 
gross profit change dollars in millions gross profit gross margin in  gross profit decreased million or as compared to  while gross margin increased to from 
the margin rate increase was largely the result of a product mix shift to more residential roofing products  which have substantially higher gross margins than the more competitive non residential market  partially offset by margin rate pressures from increased competition for fewer orders 
in addition  the benefit of lower weighted average costs of residential roofing products in comparison to the current prices of those products in the marketplace continued from the fourth quarter of fiscal year into the first quarter of this year 
this weighted average cost effect ended during the second quarter of and we currently expect our future overall gross margin to range from  depending upon product mix 
direct sales products shipped by our vendors directly to our customers  which typically have substantially lower gross margins than our warehouse sales  represented and of our net sales for and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage of direct sales was attributable to the lower mix of non residential roofing product sales 
there were no material changes in the direct sales mix of our geographical regions 
operating expenses change dollars in millions operating expenses operating expenses as a of sales 
table of contents our operating expenses decreased by million to million in from million in the following factors were the leading causes of our lower operating expenses savings of million in payroll and related costs  primarily driven by a lower headcount  lower incentive based pay  and reductions in overtime  partially offset by less favorable medical claims experience  savings of million in selling expenses  primarily from lower transportation costs resulting from lower fuel prices and the lower sales volumes  partially offset by an increase in credit card fees  reductions of million in various general administrative expenses  mainly from decreases in workmen s compensation and auto insurance costs  a reduction of million in the provision for bad debts primarily due to collections of aged receivables  and reduced depreciation and amortization expense of million due to lower amortization of intangible assets and the impact of very low capital expenditures in  partially offset by an increase of million in warehouse expenses  mostly due to costs associated with the closing of the six branches 
in  we expensed a total of million for the amortization of intangible assets recorded under purchase accounting compared to million in our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in as we were able to control our variable costs and reduce fixed costs 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a continued pay down of debt and lower average interest rates  which affected the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt 
interest expense would have been and million less in and  respectively  without the impact of our derivatives 
income taxes income tax expense increased to million in from million in our effective income tax rate was  compared to our effective income tax rate of 
the rate decrease was primarily due to refunds for prior years tax credits and favorable state income tax audit results 
we also experienced a reduction in our state income tax rate due to a higher apportionment in states with lower income tax rates 
we expect our future effective income tax rate to fluctuate around  depending primarily upon the results of our operations in canada and in the various states in which we operate 
compared to the following table shows a summary of our results of operations for and  broken down by existing markets and acquired markets 

table of contents for the fiscal years ended existing markets acquired markets consolidated in thousands net sales gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating expenses as a of net sales operating income operating margin net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  to  million in from  million in sales from acquired markets increased million  while existing markets saw internal growth of million  or 
there was one additional business day in as compared to  which we believe increased annual existing market sales by approximately 
during  we opened one new branch and closed four branches 
the product group sales for our existing markets were as follows for the fiscal years ended existing markets change dollars in millions net sales mix net sales mix residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products note total existing market sales of  million plus sales from acquired markets of million equal the total sales of  million 
our acquired markets had product group sales of  and million in residential roofing products  non residential roofing products  and complementary building products  respectively for total existing market sales of  million plus sales from acquired markets of million equal the total sales of  million 
our acquired markets had product group sales of  and million in residential roofing products  non residential roofing products  and complementary building products  respectively for we believe the existing market information is useful to investors because it helps explain organic growth or decline 
our existing market sales were affected by the following factors a rapid rise in prices beginning in february  especially in residential roofing products  strong re roofing activity in storm affected regions  continued strength in non residential roofing activity in most markets  and one additional business day in as compared to 
table of contents partially offset by the negative impact of continued weakness in new residential roofing activity in most markets  and lower complementary product sales in most markets  especially where we have had historically higher levels of new residential construction 
gross profit change dollars in millions gross profit existing markets gross margin existing markets in  existing markets gross profit increased million or as compared to  while our acquired markets gross profit increased million 
our overall gross margin increased to from  while our existing markets gross margin increased to in from in these increases were mostly in our residential roofing products and resulted principally from the pass through of increases in shingle prices as we were notified of a series of price increases from our vendors  which we were experiencing beginning in february however  our cost of goods sold did not increase at the same time or rate due to favorable buying programs and the lower cost inventory on hand before the price increases 
our existing markets gross margin in non residential roofing and complementary products  excluding vendor incentives  which represents our invoiced gross margin  was relatively consistent with the effect of the price increases was partially offset in our overall gross margins by an increase in the sales mix of traditionally lower gross margin non residential roofing products  while gross margin in our existing markets benefited from an increase of residential roofing products in our existing market product sales mix  which have higher gross margins than our other products 
operating expenses change dollars in millions operating expenses existing markets operating expenses as a of sales existing markets our existing markets operating expenses increased by only million or to million in from million in  while our acquired markets operating expenses increased million 
the following factors were the leading causes of the change in our existing market operating expenses an increase in bad debts of million  as we experienced higher write offs and increased our reserves due to the economic and credit climate  and an increase of million in selling and warehouse expenses due primarily to higher transportation expenses resulting from significantly higher petroleum costs and from higher sales related costs  including credit card fees  
table of contents mostly offset by a decrease of million from both expense reduction initiatives and the benefit from leveraging certain expenses over existing and acquired markets  reduced depreciation and amortization of million due to lower amortization of intangible assets and somewhat from substantially lower capital expenditures in  and payroll and related costs decreased by million primarily from a lower headcount and favorable medical insurance claims  partially offset by higher incentive based pay and profit sharing 
existing markets operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in as we were able to control our variable costs and leverage our fixed costs 
overall operating expenses decreased to of net sales from due to the same factors and also from blending in the lower operating expense level of north coast 
in  we expensed a total of million for the amortization of intangible assets recorded under purchase accounting in our existing markets compared to million in  while acquired markets expensed million and million for and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in from million in  primarily from lower levels of debt 
average interest rates during also decreased somewhat from the prior year  which affected interest expense on our variable rate debt 
interest expense would have been million lower in and million higher in without the impact of our derivatives 
income taxes income tax expense increased to million in from million in our effective income tax rate was  compared to our effective income tax rate of 
the rate increase was primarily due to adjustments of previously accrued income taxes related to previously filed tax returns that benefited the income tax rate 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in general  sales and net income are highest during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters  which represent the peak months of construction and re roofing  especially in our northeastern us and canada regions 
our sales are substantially lower during the second quarter  when we usually incur net losses 
these quarterly fluctuations have diminished as we have diversified into the southern regions of the united states 
we generally experience an increase of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable during the first  third and fourth quarters of the year as a result of seasonality 
when we need to borrow  our borrowings generally peak during the third quarter as accounts payable offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur from june through november 
we usually experience a slowing of collections of our accounts receivable during our second quarter  mainly due to the inability of our customers to conduct their businesses effectively in inclement weather 
we continue to attempt to collect those receivables which require payment under our standard terms 
we do not provide any concessions to our customers during this period of the year to incentivize sales 
also  during the second quarter  we generally experience our lowest availability under our senior secured credit facilities  which are based on accounts receivable 

table of contents certain quarterly financial data the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the fiscal years and which  in the opinion of management  reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 
totals may not total due to rounding

in general  we have been able to pass on price increases from our vendors to our customers in a timely manner 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our operations in however  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced unusual and frequent price increases in many our products that are derived from petroleum based raw materials  especially asphalt shingles in our residential roofing products 
we estimate that this unusual inflation increased our sales by approximately and our fourth quarter sales by approximately above historical annual inflation for our industry 
we further estimate that this caused a temporary increase in our gross margin of approximately basis points for the fourth quarter 
we also estimate that this inflation increased our gross profit by approximately million  net income by million and fully diluted earnings per share by 
these conditions continued into the first few months of  but did not have a material impact on our earnings results compared to liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at september  compared to million at september  our net working capital was million at september  compared to million at september  compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in in addition to the benefit from improved operating results  accounts receivable decreased by million in due primarily to the collection of the high prior year end receivables and the 
table of contents lower fourth quarter sales 
in addition  inventories decreased by million due to the lower sales and purchasing activity 
the favorable impact from those changes was partially offset by a decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses  due to lower forth quarter purchasing levels  voluntary accelerated payments to certain vendors in order to receive additional discounted terms  and the payment of previously accrued income taxes 
an increase of million in prepaid expenses and other assets was also an unfavorable impact on cash from operating activities 
the number of days outstanding for accounts receivable  based upon sales for each year  decreased in from mainly from the favorable impact of a higher mix of residential roofing products which have shorter payment terms  while inventory turns were up slightly in as compared to net cash used in investing activities increased by million in to million from million in  due primarily to increased capital spending for transportation and material handling equipment  and the purchase of the land and building at one of our prior leased facilities for approximately million 
we continue to closely manage our capital expenditures during these challenging economic times and we expect future fiscal year capital expenditures to total approximately of net sales  exclusive of the impact of any branch openings 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million in these amounts primarily reflect repayments under our revolving lines of credit and term loan 
under the excess cash flow provision of the credit facility described below  there was a million accelerated payment due under the term loan that was made in april compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for although our income from operations increased to million in from million in  we increased our inventories by million  especially in residential asphalt shingles  in reaction to announced price increases from our vendors and to ensure sufficient availability in the regions affected by storms 
due to this build up  inventory turns were down in as compared to  but we gained an advantage by having lower cost inventory to sell 
average inventory per branch was up about in as compared to  primarily from the build up  but also due to the high inflation in our product cost since accounts receivable increased by million in  primarily due to increased sales in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase in our doubtful accounts  while the number of days outstanding for accounts receivable increased slightly in prepaid expenses and other assets also increased by million  mainly due to higher levels of vendor rebates caused by increased purchases during the third and fourth quarters 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million in  mostly from the higher level of inventory purchases  increases in income taxes payable and performance based pay accruals 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in  due primarily to our acquisitions for which we paid in we also substantially reduced capital spending from million in to million in due to a slowdown in our business during and the first half of and the prior year required upgrades to the truck fleets of some of our recent acquisitions 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in the net cash used by financing activities in primarily reflected repayments under our revolving lines of credit and term loans 
the net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected net term loan borrowings under our new credit facility  which refinanced our prior revolving facilities and term loans  payment of related deferred financing costs  and the financing of our acquisitions as mentioned above 

table of contents capital resources our principal source of liquidity at september  was our cash and cash equivalents of million and our available borrowings of million under revolving lines of credit 
our borrowing base availability is determined primarily by trade accounts receivable  less outstanding borrowings 
borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit in the accompanying balance sheet at september  and were classified as short term debt since we paid off those borrowings subsequent to the respective year ends and there is no current expectation of a minimum level of outstanding revolver borrowings during the subsequent months 
liquidity is defined as the current amount of readily available cash and the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current needs for cash 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
our cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid money market funds which in invest in commercial paper or bonds with a rating of a or better  or in a us treasury money market fund 
significant factors which could affect future liquidity include the following the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms  cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
our primary capital needs are for working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations and cash equivalents  supplemented by bank borrowings 
in the past  we have financed acquisitions initially through increased bank borrowings  the issuance of common stock and or other borrowings 
we then repay any such borrowings with cash flows from operations 
the november refinancing of our credit facilities discussed below provided us with approximately million of additional funds at the time of the closing for future acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements 
we have funded our past capital expenditures through increased bank borrowings  including equipment financing  or through capital leases  and then have reduced these obligations with cash flows from operations 
we believe we have adequate current liquidity and availability of capital to fund our present operations  meet our commitments on our existing debt and fund anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually seek potential acquisitions and from time to time hold discussions with acquisition candidates 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a strong base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms  as we have in the past 
we may also issue additional shares of common stock to raise funds  which we did in december  or we may issue preferred stock 
indebtedness we currently have the following credit facilities a senior secured credit facility in the us  a canadian senior secured credit facility  and an equipment financing facility 

table of contents senior secured credit facilities on november   we entered into an amended and restated seven year million us senior secured credit facility and a c million senior secured canadian credit facility with ge antares capital ge antares and a syndicate of other lenders combined  the credit facility 
the credit facility refinanced the prior million credit facilities that also were provided through ge antares 
the credit facility provides us with lower interest rates and available funds for future acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements 
in addition  the credit facility increased the allowable total equipment financing and or capital lease financing to million 
the credit facility provides for a cash receipts lock box arrangement that gives us sole control over the funds in lock box accounts  unless excess availability is less than million or an event of default occurs  in which case the senior secured lenders would have the right to take control over such funds and to apply such funds to repayment of the senior debt 
the credit facility consists of a us revolving credit facility of million the us revolver  which includes a sub facility of million for letters of credit  and an initial million term loan the term loan 
the credit facility also includes a c million senior secured revolving credit facility provided by ge canada finance holding company the canada revolver 
there was a combined million available for borrowings and less than million was outstanding under the us revolver and canadian revolver at september  there were million of outstanding standby letters of credit at september  the term loan requires amortization of per year  payable in quarterly installments of approximately million  plus any required prepayments under the excess cash flow  discussed below  and with the remainder due in the credit facility may also be expanded by up to an additional million under certain conditions 
there are mandatory prepayments under the credit facility under certain conditions  including the following cash flow condition excess cash flow on may of each fiscal year  commencing on may   we must pay an amount equal to of the excess cash flow as defined in the credit facility for the prior fiscal year  not to exceed million with respect to any fiscal year 
based on our results for  we will be required to make a million payment by may  the amounts payable under this provision were classified as short term debt at september  and interest interest on borrowings under the us credit facility is payable at our election at either of the following rates the base rate that is the higher of a the base rate for corporate loans quoted in the wall street journal or b the federal reserve overnight rate plus of plus a margin of for the term loan 
the current libor rate plus a margin of for us revolver loans or for term loan 
interest under the canadian credit facility is payable at our election at either of the following rates an index rate that is the higher of the canadian prime rate as quoted in the globe and mail and the day ba rate plus  or the ba rate as described in the canadian facility plus the us revolver currently carries an interest rate at the base rate at september   while the canada revolver carries an interest rate of the canadian prime rate plus at 
table of contents september   and the term loan carries an interest rate of libor plus and for two libor arrangements under the term loan at september  
unused fees on the revolving credit facilities are per annum 
availability under the revolving credit facilities is limited to of eligible accounts receivable  increasing to from january through april of each year 
financial covenants  which apply only to the term loan  are limited to a leverage ratio and a yearly capital expenditure limitation as follows maximum consolidated leverage ratio on the last day of each fiscal quarter  our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  must not be greater than at september   this ratio was capital expenditures we cannot incur aggregate capital expenditures  as defined  in excess of three percent of consolidated gross revenue for any fiscal year 
as of september   we were in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock and assets of wholly owned subsidiaries  secure obligations under the credit facility 
prior senior secured credit facilities the credit facilities in place prior to the credit facility discussed above were scheduled to mature on october  and consisted of a million us revolving line of credit and a c million canadian revolving line of credit  referred to as revolvers  and term loans totaling million 
these facilities provided for the same lock box arrangements as under the credit facility 
at the time of the refinancing discussed above  there was million of borrowings outstanding under the prior revolvers 
equipment financing facilities we have an equipment financing facility which allows for the financing of up to million of purchased transportation and material handling equipment through february  at an interest rate approximately above the or year term swap rate at the time of the advances 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at september   however  there were million of equipment financing loans outstanding under prior equipment financing facilities at september   with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
table of contents contractual obligations at september   our contractual obligations were as follows fiscal years thereafter senior bank debt and revolver equipment financing operating leases interest non cancelable purchase obligations total interest payments reflect all currently scheduled amounts along with projected amounts to be paid under the senior bank debt using a libor curve to estimate the future interest rates and considering our current interest rate hedges 
in general  we purchase products under purchase obligations that are cancelable by us without cost or expire after days 
capital expenditures excluding acquisitions  we incurred net capital expenditures of  and million in  and  respectively 
over of our capital expenditures have generally been made for transportation and material handling equipment 
in  we resumed a more normal spend rate with capital expenditures at of sales after we substantially reduced capital expenditures in of sales due to the business slowdown 
capital expenditures in as a percentage of sales were  as we upgraded the fleet of our acquired companies 
we continue to closely manage our capital expenditures during these challenging economic times and we expect future annual capital expenditures to total approximately of net sales  exclusive of the impact of new branch openings 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  commonly referred to as us gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following accounting policies that require us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we began using the fair value method of accounting for employee and non employee director stock based compensation in after our ipo in and through  no compensation expense 
table of contents was recognized for stock options granted to employees and non employee directors because all such stock options granted had exercise prices equal to the market value of our stock on the date of the grant 
compensation expense recognized after included a compensation cost for all unvested share based awards granted prior to  based on the grant date fair value estimated and b compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to  based on the grant date estimated 
results of prior periods were not restated 
we also estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
the impact of estimating forfeitures upon adoption was not material 
in addition  we report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as both a financing cash inflow and an operating cash outflow 
the excess tax benefit classified as a financing activity would have been classified as an operating inflow if we did not use the fair value method 
interest rate swaps and collars we enter into interest rate swaps and collars to minimize the risks and costs associated with financing activities  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the swap agreements are contracts to exchange variable rate for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
the collar agreements provide for fixed rate caps and floors 
our current derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  for which we record the effective portions of changes in their fair value  net of tax  in other comprehensive income 
we recognize any ineffective portion of our hedges in earnings  of which there has been none to date 
our derivative instruments prior to april were not designated as hedges and therefore changes in their fair values were recorded in interest expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral  although we typically obtain payment and performance bonds for any type of public work and have the ability to lien projects under certain circumstances 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from most customers within days  except for sales to our commercial roofing contractors  which we typically require to pay in days 
as our business is seasonal in certain regions  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
throughout the year  we record estimated reserves based upon our judgment of specific customer situations  aging of accounts and our historical write offs of uncollectible accounts 
periodically  we perform a specific analysis of all accounts past due and write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote based upon the following factors aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  review of the customer s financial statements when available  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
we charge these write offs against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the past  bad debts typically averaged approximately of net sales 
in and  we experienced an increase to and of net sales  respectively  which is still within our tolerances and reflective of the tougher economic and credit climate 

table of contents inventory valuation product inventories represent one of our largest assets and are recorded at net realizable value 
our goal is to manage our inventory so that we minimize out of stock positions 
to do this  we maintain an adequate inventory of skus at each branch based on sales history 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory 
we monitor our inventory levels by branch and record provisions for excess inventories based on slower moving inventory 
we define potential excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the historical usage  excluding items purchased in the last three months 
we then apply our judgment as to forecasted demand and other factors  including liquidation value  to determine the required adjustments to net realizable value 
in addition  at the end of each year  we evaluate our inventory at each branch and write off and dispose of obsolete products 
our inventories are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence 
during the year  we perform periodic cycle counts and write off excess or damaged inventory as needed 
at year end we take a physical inventory and record any necessary additional write offs 
vendor rebates our typical rebate arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount  payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures generally related to the volume of purchases from our vendors 
we account for these rebates as a reduction of the prices of the related vendors products  which reduces the inventory cost until the period in which we sell the product  at which time these rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of rebates receivable based upon the expected level of purchases 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
historically  our actual rebates have been within our expectations used for our estimates 
if we fail to achieve a measure which is required to obtain a vendor rebate  we will have to record a charge in the period that we determine the criteria or measure for the vendor rebate will not be met to the extent the vendor rebate was estimated and included as a reduction to cost of sales 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to products already purchased  it may impact our gross margin on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize revenue at the point of sale or upon delivery to the customer s site 
for goods shipped by third party carriers  we recognize revenue upon shipment since the terms are fob shipping point 
approximately of our revenues are for products delivered by us or picked up by our customers at our facilities  which provides for timely and accurate revenue recognition 
we also ship certain products directly from the manufacturer to the customer 
revenues are recognized upon notifications of deliveries from our vendors 
delays in receiving delivery notifications could impact our financial results  although it has not been material to our consolidated results of operations in the past 

table of contents we also provide certain job site delivery services  which include crane rentals and rooftop deliveries of certain products  for which the associated revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
these revenues represent less than of our net sales 
all revenues recognized are net of sales taxes collected  allowances for discounts and estimated returns  which are provided for at the time of pick up or delivery 
in the past  customer returns have not been material to our consolidated results of operations 
all sales taxes collected are subsequently remitted to the appropriate government authorities 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires us to recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities to the extent that they are realizable 
deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
we have operations in us states and three provinces in canada and we are subject to potential tax audits in each of these jurisdictions and federally in both the united states and canada 
these audits may involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
accruals for uncertain tax positions require us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of potential tax audits 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we adopted the accounting guidance originally issued in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes codified primarily in fasb asc topic  income taxes  effective october   which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in connection with the adoption  we analyzed our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess paid to acquire businesses over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
at september   our goodwill balance was approximately million  representing approximately of our total assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
examples of such indicators include a significant change in the business climate  unexpected competition  loss of key personnel or a decline in our market capitalization below our net book value 
in performing the impairment test  we utilize a two step approach 
the first step requires a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component defined as a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by component managers  which in our case is our regions 
we aggregate components within a reporting unit that have similar economic characteristics 
for purposes of determining our aggregation  we evaluate the distribution method  sales mix  and operating results of each of our regions and conclude if these have or will be sustained over a long term basis 
for purposes of this evaluation  we would expect our regions to exhibit similar economic characteristics years after events such as an acquisition within our core roofing business or management business restructuring 
this evaluation also considers major storm activity or local economic challenges that may impact the short term operations of the region 
based on 
table of contents our evaluation at september   two of our regions did not exhibit similar economic characteristics and therefore were individually evaluated for goodwill impairment as separate reporting units 
the remaining components were aggregated into a third reporting unit the aggregated reporting unit and tested in total for goodwill impairment 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a market approach  an income approach  or a weighted average of the two approaches 
the market approach utilizes a guideline transaction method  which derives applicable market multiples from the prices at which comparable companies are trading in an active marketplace 
we believe the market approach generally provides a meaningful indicator of fair value as it reflects the current value at which shares of comparable companies are actively traded in a free and open market 
the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow method dcf that estimates after tax cash flows on a debt free basis  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we believe the dcf provides a meaningful indicator of fair value as well  since it appropriately measures the income producing assets and reflects the income potential that would establish the amount paid by an investor 
the key assumptions used in the market approach included the use of comparable publicly traded companies  which we considered to be distributors of industrial construction products 
the application of adjustments for a control premium and for risk and growth considerations  which were consistent with premiums and considerations in recent acquisitions 
the key assumptions used in the dcf approach included the reporting unit s five year projections of financial results including sales and margin improvements  which were based on our strategic plans and long range forecasts 
sales growth rates represent estimates based on current and forecasted sales mix and market conditions 
the profit margins were projected by each reporting unit based on historical margins  projected sales mix  current expense structure and anticipated expense reductions 
the projected terminal value  which reflected the total present value of projected cash flows beyond the last period in the dcf 
this value reflected our estimate for stable  perpetual growth of each reporting unit 
the discount rate was set by using a weighted average cost of capital method that considered market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors 
we utilized a market approach to determine the fair value of the aggregated reporting unit and a combination of income and market approaches to determine the fair values of our other two reporting units 
given the size of the respective reporting units  relative to the overall company  we believe these approaches provide the best indications of the fair values 
to corroborate our calculations  we reconciled the company s total market capitalization value to the sum of the fair values of the three reporting units 
our market capitalization reflects an implied control premium that we believe is consistent with recent acquisitions in the industry 
based on our calculations  the fair value of the aggregated reporting unit significantly exceeded the respective carrying value 
in addition  for one of the two remaining reporting units  with million in goodwill  our calculations indicated a fair value which significantly exceeded its carrying value  while the other reporting unit  with million in goodwill  provided fair value indications ranging from to above its carrying value 
the significant inputs used in the fair value calculations discussed above represent our best estimate 
management performed sensitivity analyses utilizing more conservative assumptions for the fair value estimate of the reporting unit that had only a to excess fair value 
for example  management changed the discount rate and the terminal growth rate by basis points each and reduced the forecasted cash flows and market multiples by each 
these analyses noted that an individual change to any one of these assumptions would not reduce the fair value below the carrying value  however any combination of these changes in 
table of contents assumptions would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
as a result  if actual operating results and or the underlying assumptions used in the analyses differ from expected  a future impairment charge may be necessary 
based on the results of the first step of the impairment test  the second step was not required and no impairment was recognized 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair value of any of our reporting units under the guidelines discussed above has fallen below its carrying value  we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value 
if the book value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in the determination of operating income 
adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance related to the fasb accounting standards codification asc 
effective for interim and annual financial periods ending after september   the asc has become the source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the asc has become non authoritative 
this new guidance affected the way in which we reference and report accounting and reporting standards beginning with this form k 
in may  the fasb issued guidance on subsequent events that establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date and requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and whether that represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this new guidance was effective for us in and  consistent with our prior practice  we evaluated all subsequent events that occurred through the time this form k was filed with the sec on december  in april  the fasb issued disclosure guidance about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements 
this was effective for us in but had no impact on our financial statements 
effective october   we followed new guidance from the fasb that clarifies the fair value objective and establishes a framework for developing fair value estimates 
this new guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value  giving the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level inputs  the next priority to observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level inputs and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level inputs 
our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are our interest rate swaps and collars see item a 
also beginning october   new fasb guidance permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
there was no impact to us from this change as we chose to retain our current accounting valuation methods for those items 
in march  the fasb issued guidance that requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
in addition to disclosing the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format  entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this new guidance was effective for us in the quarter ended march  
table of contents other recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance that changes the way entities account for securitizations and special purpose entities 
this new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after november  we do not expect this change to impact our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance that will significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements 
this is guidance will be effective for our financial statements in the fiscal year beginning october  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we believe the adoption of this guidance could have a significant impact on the accounting for our future acquisitions  depending on the circumstances and the terms of the acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our on going business operations 
our primary exposure includes changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to the variable rate borrowings under our credit facility 
the following discussion of our interest rate swaps and collars see financial derivatives below is based on a change in interest rates 
these changes are hypothetical scenarios used to calibrate potential risk and do not represent our view of future market changes 
as the hypothetical figures discussed below indicate  changes in fair value based on the assumed change in rates generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
at september   we had million of term loans and less than million of revolving credit outstanding under our credit facility 
our weighted average effective interest rate on that debt  after considering the effect of the interest rate swaps  was at september  a hypothetical increase in interest rates in effect at september   would have increased annual interest expense on the borrowings outstanding at that date by approximately million 
we enter into interest rate swaps and collars to minimize the risks and costs associated with financing activities  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the swap agreements discussed below are contracts to exchange variable rate for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
the collar agreements  also discussed below  provide for fixed rate caps and floors 
the aggregate fair value of these swaps and collars represented a loss of million at september  a hypothetical increase or decrease of in interest rates from the level in effect at september   would result in an aggregate unrealized gain or loss in value of the swaps and collars of approximately million or million  respectively 
financial derivatives the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging and non trading purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects the company to certain risks  such as market and credit risks 
market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will change 
in a hedging relationship  the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract 
the notional  or contractual  amount of the 
table of contents company s derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the company s exposure due to credit risk 
the company s current derivative instruments are with counterparties rated highly by nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
the company is using interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk of interest rate changes by converting a portion of its variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings 
as of september   the following interest rate derivative instruments were outstanding a interest rate swaps totaling million  expiring in april  with a fixed rate of  b a million interest rate collar expiring in april with a floor rate of and a cap rate of  c a million interest rate collar expiring in april with a floor rate of and a cap rate of  d a million future starting interest rate swap executed in may  with interest cash flows commencing in april and expiring in april and with a fixed rate of  e a million future starting interest rate swap executed in june  with interest cash flows commencing in april and expiring in april and with a fixed rate of  and f a million future starting interest rate swap executed in june  with interest cash flows commencing in april and expiring in april and with a fixed rate of 
at no time during the terms of the forward stating derivatives do the associated cash flows overlap with those associated with the derivatives expiring in april these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  for which the company records the effective portions of changes in their fair value  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
the effectiveness of the hedges is periodically assessed by the company during the lives of the hedges by comparing the current terms of the hedges with the related hedged debt to assure they continue to coincide and through an evaluation of the counterparties to the hedges to honor their obligations under the hedges 
any ineffective portion of the hedges is recognized in earnings  of which there has been none to date and none is anticipated 
the company records any differences paid or received on its interest rate hedges as adjustments to interest expense 
since inception  the company has not recognized any gains or losses on these hedges 
the table below presents the combined fair values of the interest rate swap and collar instruments on the indicated balance sheets unrealized losses location on balance sheet september  september  fair value hierarchy dollars in thousands accrued expenses   level the fair values of the interest rate swaps and collars were determined through the use of pricing models  which utilize verifiable inputs such as market interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals generally referred to as the libor curve for the full terms of the swap and collar agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from sales to customers in canada 
this business is primarily conducted in the local currency 
this exposes us to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can adversely affect revenues  net income and cash flows 
we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk
