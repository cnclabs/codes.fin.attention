item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this section is intended to provide an understanding of the financial performance of white river through a discussion of the factors affecting white river s financial condition at december  and  and white river s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and this section should be read in conjunction with white river s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this document 
in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see discussion of forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
white river believes that the following represents the material critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ significantly from estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which provides guidance on how to measure assets and liabilities using fair value methods 
sfas no 
applied whenever another united states generally accepted accounting principle standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
this standard also requires additional disclosures in both annual and quarterly reports 
there was no cumulative effect on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the early adoption of sfas no 
on january  see note 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits all entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible assets and liabilities at fair value 
we early adopted sfas no 
on january  and applied sfas no 
solely to creditor notes payable 
see note for further details 
allowance for loan losses finance receivables provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables 
the allowance for loan losses is established systematically by management based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
coastal credit reviews charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the reporting date 
assumptions regarding probable credit losses are reviewed quarterly and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumptions increase  there could be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which could decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations 
coastal credit believes that the existing allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable finance receivable losses 
goodwill goodwill is not amortized  rather  white river annually tests the goodwill for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the reporting unit 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset depends on white river s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and its ability to not allow an ownership change to occur for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance has been derived pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and reduces the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized see note 
white river adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
on january  the implementation of fin no 
did not impact white river s consolidated financial statements 
as of january   there were no unrecognized tax benefits 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december net loss was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in income from the prior year is primarily due to the following a million impairment of goodwill during  a decrease in accretion income from beneficial interest in master trust during  and a million provision for estimated credit losses during discussion of results the following table presents consolidating financial information for white river for the periods indicated for the year ended december  uac coastal credit corporate and other consolidated total interest income interest expense net interest margin recovery provision for estimated credit losses net interest margin after recovery provision for estimated credit losses total other revenues expenses goodwill impairment income loss before income taxes for the year ended december  uac coastal credit corporate and other consolidated total interest income interest expense net interest margin recovery provision for estimated credit losses net interest margin deficit after recovery provision for estimated credit losses total other revenues expenses income loss before income taxes the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated interest on receivables decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coastal credit interest on receivables decreased million 
while the coastal credit average finance receivable balance increased to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december   finance receivables had been declining from may to january this receivable balance decline has resulted in the decline of interest on receivables 
since february  finance receivables have steadily increased 
this increase is expected to result in an increase in interest on receivables in future periods 
interest on receivables from uac declined million due to a decline in the average receivable balance to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  as a result of the liquidation of finance receivables 
accretion and other interest decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of a decrease in accretion from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income to be accreted into income in is approximately  the individual components of accretion and other interest income are shown in the following table in thousands years ended december  uac discount accretion from accumulated other comprehensive income interest on cash balances accretion and other interest income interest expense decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coastal credit interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the decrease in average line of credit and subordinated debentures to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
uac interest expense decreased by million due to the decrease in interest expense and accretion expense from the uac creditor notes payable that were acquired by white river and  to a greater extent  the prepayment of collateralized financings eliminating the related interest expense during the year ended december  as compared to an average balance of million during the same period ended december  interest expense of corporate and other was million for the year ended december  no such expense was incurred by the holding company during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of the prepayment of the secured note payable on october  provision for estimated credit losses was million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for estimated credit losses is charged to income to bring coastal credit s allowance for estimated credit losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
for coastal credit  the provision for estimated credit losses was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  provision for estimated credit losses is charged to income to bring coastal credit s allowance for estimated credit losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
uac recorded recovery for estimated credit losses of million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change in recovery for estimated credit losses is a result of declining defaulted receivables during the million charge to master trust  net  for the year ended december   is expense related to future transfers of funds to the master trust from securitized finance receivables of uac 
with the clean up call of all securitizations on december  and termination of the master trust agreement  there was no charge to master trust  net for the year ended december and there will be no future charge to master trust  net activity 
gain from deficiency sale and litigation settlement was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this gain is the result of the sale of deficiency receivables during and other expense was million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense is primarily expenses related to collections of previously charged off balances 
salaries and benefits increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of performance based awards paid during the second quarter of of approximately million 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  coastal credit and uac operating expenses remained relatively unchanged between these periods 
corporate and other operating expenses increased million between these periods 
this increase was primarily a result of non employee performance based awards paid during the second quarter in addition to transaction related expenses resulting from the pending merger with first chicago 
white river conducted its annual test for impairment of goodwill as of august  the annual impairment test of goodwill resulted in the full impairment of goodwill totaling million 
the methodology for determining the fair value was a combination of quoted market prices  prices of comparable businesses  discounted estimated cash flows and other valuation techniques 
the significant downturn in the equity markets during the third quarter exacerbated the decreased valuations calculated using these methodologies 
third party servicing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  uac is the only segment that incurred this expense 
this decrease is the result of the ongoing liquidation of the uac receivable portfolio during uac pays a monthly servicing fee per active receivable 
as the number of receivables decreased as the result of the liquidation of receivables  the third party servicing expenses decreased 
bankruptcy costs are professional fees and expenses associated with the bankruptcy proceedings of uac 
these costs were  for the year ended december  uac is the only segment that incurred these costs which were for the purpose of assisting the reorganized company in complying with its bankruptcy plan 
future bankruptcy costs were eliminated with the closure of the bankruptcy case on january  income tax benefit was million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the expense is based on the estimated effective tax rates for and  respectively 
the benefit for the year ended december  was primarily a result of the million tax effect from the impairment of deductible goodwill 
financial condition as of december  and finance receivables  net finance receivables  net decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  uac finance receivables  net decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  coastal credit finance receivables  net increased to million compared to million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
a significant number of contracts acquired by coastal credit are contracts made with borrowers who are in the united states military 
as of december   of the coastal credit receivables were with borrowers who are in the united states military as compared to as of december  coastal credit believes that having in the portfolio a significant percentage of contracts for which the borrowers are united states military personnel contributes to lower payment delinquency and greater collection personnel efficiencies 
coastal credit requests that all borrowers who are in the military use the military allotment system to make payments on their contracts 
under this allotment system  the borrower authorizes the military to make a payroll deduction for the amount of the borrower s monthly contract payment and to direct this deduction payment to coastal credit on behalf of the borrower 
delinquency of payments on contracts paid by allotment historically has been less than delinquency of payments on contracts not paid by allotment 
as a result  the collection effort associated with the military contracts requires substantially less time  allowing coastal credit s collection staff to focus on an increasing number of non military contracts 
as of december   coastal credit s finance receivables consisted exclusively of contracts acquired by coastal credit without credit recourse to the dealer 
although all the contracts in coastal credit s portfolio were acquired without credit recourse  each dealer remains liable to coastal credit for liabilities arising from certain representations and warranties made by the dealer with respect to compliance with applicable federal and state laws and valid title to the vehicle 
coastal credit s policy is to only acquire a contract after the dealer has provided coastal credit with the requisite proof that coastal credit will have a first priority lien on the financed vehicle  that the borrower has obtained the required collision insurance naming coastal credit as loss payee and that the contract has been fully and accurately completed and validly executed 
coastal credit typically buys contracts on an individual basis and occasionally considers portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy 
accrued interest payable accrued interest payable was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of the decrease of the line of credit liability 
creditor notes payable creditor notes payable was million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease was the result of continued repayment of principal in accordance with the uac bankruptcy plan 
beginning january   creditor notes payable was recorded at fair market value in accordance with white river s early adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in net cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily a result of the reduction of interest expense from coastal credit related to the reduction in the average line of credit between the periods and the elimination of the charge to master trust 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  this change was primarily the result of a reduction in the principal collection and recoveries on the uac finance receivable portfolio and the increase in purchases of finance receivables by coastal credit 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the million net repayment of the line of credit 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the million principal payments of collateralized financing  million principal payments on the secured note payable and the principal payments of subordinated debentures of million 
at december   white river and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december coastal credit has a revolving credit facility from a lending institution with a maximum borrowing limit of million 
the maturity date on the line of credit is december  and the interest rate is the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
as of december   coastal credit had million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility as compared to million as of december  there was million and million available in excess of the amount utilized at december  and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of coastal credit 
in addition  white river has provided an unconditional corporate guaranty 
coastal credit must maintain specified financial ratios within guidelines established by the lender 
interest is paid monthly at a variable rate  based on meeting certain financial criteria 
the average rate during the month of december  and was libor plus which equated to and  respectively 
there is an annual commitment fee of of on the average daily unused commitment 
in the event of a significant pay down or an earlier retirement of the revolver commitment  coastal credit would sustain certain prepayment penalties 
this facility limits distributions coastal credit may make to white river to of coastal credit s net income in addition to permitted payments on subordinated debt including white river debt guaranteed by coastal credit 
uac s sources of liquidity are limited and consist of cash on hand  escrowed cash for operations  funds from consolidated operations and cash collections from the liquidating finance receivables 
white river  as owner of the substantial majority of uac s notes and claims outstanding under the plan of reorganization  is entitled to distribution of the substantial majority of these cash flows as they are realized by uac 
however  the realization of such projected cash flows is dependent upon the performance of the underlying auto receivable portfolios and the effective servicing of such receivables 
in particular  if gross defaults  recoveries on defaulted receivables or prepayments on such receivables are less favorable than the rates projected by management  uac s realization of such cash flows will be reduced or delayed relative to such projections 
such reduction may be material 
white river s sources of liquidity  as the parent company  are limited and consist of cash on hand  payments by uac on the uac creditor notes payable owned by white river and distributions by coastal credit subject to restrictions under coastal credit s credit facility 
white river currently intends to retain its earnings to finance the growth and development of its businesses and has no present intention of paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
asset quality set forth below is certain information concerning the credit loss experiences on the fixed rate retail automobile receivables of white river 
there can be no assurance that future net credit loss experience on the receivables will be comparable to that set forth below

finance receivables coastal credit delinquency experience of finance receivables at coastal credit  including unearned interest in thousands december  finance receivables gross balance delinquencies days days days total delinquencies as a result of the nature of the customers in coastal credit s portfolio  coastal credit considers the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses to be critical to its financial results 
coastal credit has an allowance for loan losses that is calculated independent of the aggregate acquisition discounts and fees on finance receivables 
coastal credit s allowance for loan losses is based upon the historical rate at which current loans  contracts in a  and day delinquency state and loans ineligible for its borrowing line  have defaulted 
these historical rates are evaluated and revised on a quarterly basis for current conditions

in addition  there have been auto finance companies which have seen their lines of credit reduced or terminated as a result of the credit crisis 
some companies have been forced to severely curtail loan purchases and originations or shut down operations as a result of a lack of funding 
we believe white river is well positioned to continue operations and grow the company responsibly based on the following factors coastal credit is not dependent on the securitization market for financing 
at december   there was million available  in excess of the amount utilized  from the line of credit  which does not expire until december white river is very well capitalized with an equity to asset ratio of as of december  while there is never any guarantee white river will not be faced with similar financing scenarios as others have seen  we believe white river is well positioned in this difficult economic environment  and we expect to be able to fund normal business operations and meet our general liquidity needs for the next months through access to the line of credit  cash flows from operation  and our other funding sources
