item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation the corporation operates in two business segments 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel and davy roll company limited davy roll 
union electric steel is one of the world s largest manufacturers of forged hardened steel rolls with principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana whereas davy roll produces cast iron and steel rolls in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
the air and liquid processing segment consists of aerofin corporation aerofin  buffalo air handling company buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  inc buffalo pumps 
aerofin produces highly engineered heat exchange coils for a variety of users including electric utility  hvac  power generation  industrial process and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling produces custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
aerofin and buffalo air handling have operations in virginia and buffalo pumps is located in new york 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
for the year  the forged and cast rolls segment achieved record earnings aided significantly by the unprecedented worldwide demand from steel and aluminum producers 
however  production in the fourth quarter slowed as a result of the global economic downturn and recession which forced customers to cut back their output  temporarily shut down facilities and place new mill projects on hold 
operating results for davy roll have been further impacted by the weakening of the british pound sterling in relation to the us dollar 
with ongoing uncertainty in the industry  expectations for are for reduced roll consumption and  for the corporation  lower production levels particularly for cast rolls in england 
while order backlogs orders on hand remain strong  many customers are requesting deferral of roll shipments and the corporation is working with each of them by agreeing to the extent possible to reschedule deliveries into future periods 
the corporation believes the global shortage of capacity for forged hardened steel rolls  which resulted in the enormous order backlog for union electric steel  will continue to be a significant factor in demand when steel and aluminum production returns to more normal levels 
the outlook for the segment in is for continuing profitability but materially below the record results of the last two years 
while some capital projects have been deferred  the expansion at union electric steel s melting and forging facility along with the installation of a forge press  manipulator and ancillary equipment remain active and targeted for completion in mid similarly  furnace enhancements at davy roll are proceeding as planned 
these projects are critical to minimize equipment downtime  improve productivity and maintain the manufacture of premium  quality product 
in  a subsidiary of union electric steel entered into an agreement with maanshan iron steel company limited maanshan to form a joint venture company in china 
the joint venture will principally manufacture and sell forged backup rolling mill rolls of a size and weight currently not able to be produced by union electric steel 
the initial annual capacity of the joint venture was expected to approximate  metric tons  however  the global slowdown in roll consumption has caused the joint venture to reduce its initial capacity by approximately fifty percent 
production is expected to begin by mid and union electric steel will have exclusive rights for sales and marketing 
union electric steel accounts for its interest in the joint venture on the equity method of accounting 
in  results of the air and liquid processing segment were impacted by a pre tax charge of  for the increase in estimated settlement and defense costs of pending and future asbestos claims net of estimated insurance recoveries 
the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiary companies within the air and liquid processing group 
with the help of experts in asbestos liability valuation and insurance recovery  the corporation determined that litigation costs net of insurance recoveries could be reasonably estimated for a period of ten years ending december causing the additional charge see note to consolidated financial statements 
the air and liquid processing group has not been affected by the weakened economy as significantly as the forged and cast rolls group 
based on order backlog  buffalo pumps and aerofin are expected to be operating at normal capacity for the first part of with performance for the remainder of the year contingent on the volume of new orders 
buffalo air handling  however  is dependent on industrial and institutional construction spending which has slowed significantly 
accordingly  it is expected that the business will struggle to repeat results of excluding the charge for asbestos litigation in  the comparable outlook for the segment in is for continuing profitability but at a lower level 
ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents along with the global economic downturn and recession during the year  financial markets have deteriorated considerably resulting in stock market losses  collapse of major financial institutions and weakened investment returns causing the funded status of the corporation s defined benefit pension plans to decline significantly 
consequently  the corporation will be required to make contributions to each of the plans to meet targeted funding levels 
the amount of combined contributions for all of the plans in is expected to approximate  this amount may be reduced if temporary relief on funding is granted by congress to all defined benefit plan sponsors 
further contributions may be necessary in future years and  while such amounts could be significant  are contingent on the investment performance of the plans assets and the influence of pension protection regulations in the us and the us a voluntary contribution of  was made by the corporation to the us qualified defined benefit pension plan in the focus for the corporation and its subsidiaries for is to minimize the impact of the global recession on the corporation in particular by working closely with customers to reschedule deliveries into the future  managing ever changing production schedules and maintaining a workforce level in balance with manufacturing needs 
overall  the corporation expects to be profitable throughout despite the difficult economic environment 
the corporation remains financially sound with over  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  consolidated results of operations overview consolidated sales and operating income for  and are indicated below 
a full discussion of the operating results for each of the segments is presented later in this section 
the corporation net sales forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing total income loss from operations forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing corporate costs total backlog forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing total in comparison to the prior years  sales improved significantly for each of the segments on higher volumes and  for the forged and cast rolls group  better pricing when compared to income from operations for and includes a provision for asbestos related costs of  and  respectively 
additionally  operating income for was negatively impacted by higher corporate expenses including the recognition of stock based compensation costs associated with stock options granted in september and higher pension related costs 
the fluctuation in backlog is primarily attributable to the forged and cast rolls group and is more fully explained below 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales was comparable for and at and  respectively 
the slight decline is attributable to higher costs for scrap and alloys offset by higher volumes during the first part of for the forged and cast rolls segment 
although the existing variable index surcharge program helps to protect the corporation against fluctuations in the cost of steel scrap and alloys  there is a lag in timing between the recognition of these increases and the recovery of such increases from customers 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales approximated for the improvement in and from is primarily attributable to the additional volume and better pricing  particularly for the forged and cast rolls segment  offset by higher pension related costs 
selling and administrative expenses totaled  of net sales   of net sales and  of net sales for  and  respectively 
the dollar increase in over the previous years is principally due to recognition of stock based compensation associated with stock options granted in  higher sales commissions which are ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents at fixed percentage and accordingly increase as commissionable sales increase and higher pension related costs 
the dollar increase in from is primarily attributable to higher sales commissions  general inflationary increases and higher pension related costs 
the charge for asbestos litigation in represents an extension of the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries  to a period of ten years ending december  whereas the charge in represents the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries  for the period ending december  the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiaries of the air and liquid processing segment see note to consolidated financial statements 
despite the steady increase in investment balances throughout the year  investment related income decreased in when compared to due to the general decline in interest rates and lower appreciation of investments consistent with market experience 
investment related income improved in against as a result of higher investment balances throughout the year and better rates of return 
included in investment related income are dividends from the corporation s uk chinese cast roll joint venture company which approximated  and in  and  respectively 
interest expense for decreased from and attributable to lower interest rates on the corporation s variable rate industrial revenue bonds 
other income expense fluctuated primarily as a result of higher foreign exchange losses in and versus gains in and a reduction in the accrual for environmental remediation of real estate previously owned by a discontinued operation in whereas includes an additional provision of for environmental costs estimated to be incurred relating to the remediation of real estate previously owned by a discontinued operation 
the corporation s statutory income tax rate equals which compares to an effective rate of  and for  and  respectively 
for  beneficial permanent differences for the domestic operations favorably impacted the effective rates 
in addition  for and  the effective rates were reduced by the reversal of valuation allowances previously provided against deferred income tax assets associated with capital loss carryforwards 
for  reversal of valuation allowances associated primarily with the uk operation resulted in an overall income tax benefit for that year 
as a result of the above  the corporation earned  or per common share for   or per common share for and  or per common share for net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for the estimated costs of asbestos related litigation through offset by the release of tax related valuation allowances associated with capital loss carryforwards

forged and cast rolls sales operating income backlog sales and operating income for improved against the prior years due primarily to higher volumes and  when compared to  better pricing 
despite the slowdown in production and some customer deferral of shipments during the fourth quarter  the segment achieved record earnings for the year 
operating income for also includes approximately of proceeds from the settlement of business interruption insurance claims relating to equipment breakdown at davy roll but was negatively impacted by higher costs for steel scrap and alloys for the majority of the year 
while the existing variable index surcharge program helps to protect the corporation against escalations in the cost of steel scrap and alloys  there is a lag in timing between the recognition of these increases and the recovery of such increases from customers 
deterioration in the weighted average exchange rates used to translate sales and operating income of davy roll from the british pound sterling to the us dollar also affected reported sales and operating income 
the improvement in exchange rates during increased the us dollar equivalency of davy roll s sales and operating income for that year by approximately  and  respectively 
the value of order backlogs decreased in in part due to adjustments made to variable indexed surcharges included therein resulting from the decline in scrap and alloy costs late in the year 
in addition  order intake has slowed significantly ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents because of the downturn in the economy causing worldwide steel and aluminum customers to have little incentive to place orders for rolls when many of them have already made commitments for two to three years in advance 
it is difficult to accurately determine the proportion of the order backlog that will ship beyond the end of  however  based on customers deferring roll deliveries to better meet their production needs  it is likely to be more than  currently  it is not expected that orders will be cancelled due to penalty provisions contained in purchase contacts 
the forged and cast rolls group also has commitments of more than  from customers under long term supply arrangements which will be included in backlog upon receipt of specific purchase orders closer to the requirement dates for delivery 
the improvement in from was reflective of the increase in global demand along with customers ordering their rolls requirements several years in advance to ensure continuity of supply 
air and liquid processing operating loss income for and includes charges for asbestos litigation relating to claims resulting from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago by certain subsidiaries of the air and liquid processing segment of  and  respectively see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  uninsured legal and case management and valuation costs associated with asbestos litigation approximated  and in  and  respectively 
sales operating income before charge for asbestos litigation charge for asbestos litigation operating loss income after charge for asbestos litigation backlog notwithstanding the additional asbestos charge  the air and liquid processing segment had another strong performance 
sales and operating income for buffalo pumps in continued to benefit from increased demand by power generation customers and us navy shipbuilders 
sales and operating income for aerofin improved due to higher volumes from original equipment manufacturers and utility customers 
with respect to buffalo air handling  weak demand from the construction industry caused a decline in sales and operating income when compared to  however  despite the lower volumes  operating income improved when compared to as a result of manufacturing efficiencies 
order backlogs for buffalo pumps and aerofin increased against the prior years 
the pumps operation benefited from additional orders by power generation customers and navy shipbuilders and the heat exchange coil business experienced increased demand from the electric utility industry 
backlog for buffalo air handling at december  was comparable to the prior year end but less than that as of december  due to the slowing in new construction projects 
to date  the segment has not been impacted by customer requests for deferrals  however  there is no guarantee that such requests will not be made in the future 
accordingly  the majority of the backlog is currently scheduled to ship in liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities for equaled  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
while the charge for asbestos litigation recorded in and reduced earnings  it did not impact cash flows for those years by those amounts 
instead  the asbestos liability  net of insurance recoveries  will be paid over a minimum of ten years and will be subject to tax benefits 
net payments in and approximated  and  respectively  and are estimated at  in contributions to the corporation s pension and other postretirement plans are expected to approximate  in  however  this amount may be reduced if temporary relief on funding is granted by congress to all defined benefit plan sponsors 
net cash flows used in provided by investing activities were   and  in  and  respectively 
the fluctuation is primarily attributable to a change in the corporation s investment strategy in resulting in a liquidation of short term investments outstanding at december  and at each of the subsequent year ends 
capital expenditures continued to increase as a result of the major capital program which began in as of december   future capital expenditures approximate  including the purchase of a forge press  manipulator  and ancillary equipment for union electric steel s melting and forging facility  the majority of which will be spent in during and  union electric steel contributed  for its interest in the joint venture and expects to fund the balance by the end of davy roll also contributed to its chinese cast roll joint venture in net cash outflows from financing activities for represent payment of dividends 
net cash outflows from financing activities were substantially breakeven for with proceeds from the issuance of stock under the corporation s stock ampco pittsburgh annual report

by comparison  dividends paid in exceeded proceeds received from the issuance of stock under the corporation s stock option plan 
quarterly dividends for were per common share  per common share in and per common share in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the british pound sterling against the us dollar which declined significantly during as a result of the above  cash and cash equivalents increased by  in and ended the year at  in comparison to  and  at december  and  respectively 
funds on hand and funds generated from future operations are expected to be sufficient to finance the operational and capital expenditure requirements of the corporation 
the corporation also maintains short term lines of credit in excess of the cash needs of its businesses

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to meet targeted funding levels  additional contributions may be necessary and  while such amounts could be significant  are contingent on future investment performance of the plans assets  congressional action providing temporary funding relief and the influence of pension protection regulations in the us and the uk represents primarily commitments for the purchase of natural gas through early covering approximately of anticipated needs to meet orders in backlog 
represents uncertain tax positions and are included as other since the period of cash settlement can not be reasonably estimated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to environmental matters  the corporation is currently performing certain remedial actions in connection with the sale of real estate previously owned and has been named a potentially responsible party at three third party landfill sites 
in addition  as a result of a sale of a segment  the corporation retained the liability to remediate certain environmental contamination at two of the sold locations  one of which has been completed  and has agreed to indemnify the buyer against third party claims arising from the discharge of certain contamination from one of these locations  the cost for which was accrued at the time of sale 
in  based on additional data obtained and meetings with regulators which indicated that the original level of remediation contemplated would not be necessary  the corporation reduced the accrual for the remediation of the remaining sold location 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
however  the corporation believes the potential liability for all environmental proceedings of approximately accrued at december  is considered adequate based on information known to date see note to consolidated financial statements 
the nature and scope of the corporation s business brings it into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business 
consequently  the corporation and its subsidiaries from time to time are named in various legal actions 
generally  the corporation does not anticipate that its financial condition or liquidity will be materially affected by the costs of known  pending or threatened litigation 
however  the corporation and its subsidiaries are involved in multiple claims for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components used in certain ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents products and there can be no assurance that future claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than presently contemplated see note to consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced in  it is anticipated that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
product pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment is reflective of current costs with a majority of orders subject to a variable index surcharge program which helps to protect the segment against the volatility in the cost of raw materials 
additionally  long term labor agreements exist at each of the key locations and commitments have been executed for natural gas usage to cover a significant portion of orders in the backlog 
application of critical accounting policies the corporation has identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of the corporation s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  litigation  environmental matters  income taxes and stock based compensation 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from the corporation s actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  rates of increases in compensation  employee turnover and discount rates 
specifically  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
consideration is given to the mix of investments and historical rates of return 
because of the deteriorating conditions in the financial markets during the latter part of  the corporation does not believe current returns to be indicative of future investment returns 
for the domestic plan  the rates of return earned on the market related value of plan assets averaged for the ten year period of accordingly  the corporation believes the expected long term rate of return of for its domestic plan for and to be reasonable 
the foreign plan was formed in connection with the acquisition of the uk operations with plan assets transferred from the seller s plan to a newly created plan in october the rates of return earned on the market related value of the plan assets averaged for accordingly  the corporation believes the assumed long term rate of return of for and for to be reasonable 
the discount rates utilized in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of the plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
the corporation believes the assumed rates of and as of december  for its domestic and u 
k plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
the corporation believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amounts recorded in the ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually in connection with the corporation s strategic planning process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information and represents the amount at which the asset could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions  pricing and volume 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
the corporation believes the amount recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for goodwill of  is recoverable and is not impaired as of december  litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  the corporation and its subsidiaries are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products of certain of the corporation s operating subsidiaries asbestos liability and of an inactive subsidiary and another former division of the corporation 
other than an accrual for certain deductible features of its relevant insurance polices  prior to the fourth quarter of  the corporation had not accrued for settlement or defense costs for pending claims for asbestos liability nor for settlement or defense costs for claims that may be asserted against certain subsidiaries and the corporation in the future 
for prior periods  the corporation did not have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of pending or future claims 
to assist the corporation in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for asbestos liability  along with applicable insurance coverage  and the amount of any estimates  the corporation hired nationally recognized asbestos liability experts and insurance consultants 
the experts were not requested to estimate asbestos claims against the inactive subsidiary or the former division  which the corporation believes are immaterial 
based on their analyses  in  the corporation established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable costs of asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  through  and also established receivables for the insurance recoveries that were deemed probable 
these amounts relied on assumptions that are based on currently known facts and strategy 
in  the corporation undertook another review of its asbestos liability claims  defense costs and the likelihood for insurance recoveries and determined that litigation costs net of insurance recoveries could be reasonably estimated for a period of ten years ending december causing an additional provision of  the corporation s actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results 
key variables in these assumptions are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each new claim  average annual defense costs  the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers  and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers 
other factors that may affect the corporation s asbestos liability and ability to recover under its insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  reforms that may be made by state and federal courts  and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation 
the corporation intends to evaluate its estimated asbestos liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a periodic basis to determine whether any adjustments to the estimates are required 
due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance  these periodic reviews may result in the corporation incurring future charges  however  the corporation is currently unable to estimate such future charges 
adjustments  if any  to the corporation s estimate of its recorded asbestos liability and or insurance receivables could be material to operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable are recorded  and to the corporation s liquidity and consolidated financial position 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
the corporation believes the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  its tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of the corporation s operations and the nature of that profitability 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if the corporation determined it would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
ampco pittsburgh annual report 
table of contents likewise  if the corporation determined it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  it would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   the corporation has deferred income tax assets approximating  net of a valuation allowance of  the corporation does not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements related to a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return unless it is more likely than not that the tax authorities will sustain the tax position solely on the basis of the position s technical merits 
consideration is given primarily to legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law as well as their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position when assessing the sustainability of the tax position 
in the event a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not criteria  the corporation would reverse the tax benefit by recognizing a liability and recording a charge to earnings 
conversely  if the corporation subsequently determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not criteria  it would recognize the tax benefit by reducing the liability and recording a credit to earnings 
as of december   based on information known to date  the corporation believes the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return which may be challenged by the tax authorities is adequate 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
the fair value is affected by the corporation s stock price and various assumptions including assumptions about the expected term of the options  volatility  dividends and the risk free interest rate see note to consolidated financial statements 
although the corporation believes the assumptions to be reasonable  the price of the corporation s stock dropped from as of the date of grant to as of december   accordingly  such stock options were out of the money 
consequently  stock based compensation recognized and to be recognized is more than if the stock options had been granted at december  recently implemented accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation views its primary market risk exposures to relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  the corporation s policy is to hedge a portion of its foreign currency denominated sales and receivables  primarily us sales denominated in euros and us sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that some exports of the corporation s foreign operation may increase and gross margins might improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for the corporation s domestic operations may increase and gross margins might improve 
accordingly  a strengthening of either of the entities functional currency the us dollar and the british pound is not expected to have a significant effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of its raw materials and energy  the corporation enters into contracts for particular commodities copper and aluminum and purchases a portion of its energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas  steel scrap and ferro alloys would have an impact of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the ability to pass these increases on to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with the corporation potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with a majority of the customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect the corporation against such commodity price increases
