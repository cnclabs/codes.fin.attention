executive overview overview we are a leader in transactional television and the distribution of independent general motion picture entertainment 
our key customers are large cable and satellite operators in the united states 
our products are sold to these operators who then distribute them to retail customers via pay per view ppv and video on demand vod technology 
we earn revenue through contractual percentage splits of the retail price 
our three principal businesses are reflected in the transactional tv  film production and direct to consumer operating segments 
our most profitable business line has historically been the transactional tv segment 
the film production segment has also historically been a profitable business but during fiscal year has operated at a loss as a result of continued adverse changes in its business climate 
our direct to consumer segment operated at a loss in fiscal year as a result of costs we incurred to develop a test internet protocol television iptv business model 
based on lower than expected subscriber additions for the iptv test business model during the second half of fiscal year  we have restructured the operations of the direct to consumer segment through a planned  material reduction in the resources dedicated to test business models 
our corporate administration segment includes all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  including costs such as legal and accounting expenses  human resources and training  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs and the sec  investor relations  and printing costs associated with our public filings and shareholder communications 
the business models of each of our segments are summarized below 
transactional tv segment our transactional tv segment is focused on the distribution of its ppv and vod service to msos and dbs providers 
we earn a percentage of revenue  or split  from our content for each 
table of contents vod  ppv or subscription that is purchased on our customers platform 
revenue growth occurs as we launch our services to new cable msos or dbs providers  experience growth in the number of digital subscribers for systems where our services are currently distributed  when we launch additional services or replace our competitors services on existing customer cable and dbs platforms  and when our proportional buy rates improve relative to our competitors 
alternatively  our revenue could decline if we experience lower buy rates  if the revenue splits we receive from our customers decline  if additional competitive channels are added to our customers platforms or if our existing customers remove our services from their platform 
for most of its history  the transactional tv segment has been focused on growing its distribution of digital tv to markets in the us during fiscal year  we began expanding our services into new markets in north america  europe and latin america 
we believed that our business model  which has been proven in the us  would also be successful internationally 
international expansion also provides us with an opportunity to leverage our existing content libraries and technology infrastructure 
thus far  we have had success in expanding our distribution to international markets 
we plan to continue to expand our footprint to new international locations and customers  and gain additional market share and shelf space in international markets where we currently distribute content 
the vod infrastructure in many of these international markets is relatively undeveloped  and we expect that the development of that infrastructure will continue to offer opportunities to improve our international revenue 
the revenue splits we receive internationally are typically higher than the splits we receive domestically because the international cable mso and dbs industry has more market participants and is more fragmented which provides us better negotiating leverage 
we have not historically operated internationally or transacted with international regulators  competitors or cultures and as a result  we may experience operating difficulties while gaining experience with our international growth initiatives 
transactional tv segment revenue during the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year experienced the following trends revenue from our vod service has increased due to improved content performance and from a related increase in the quantity of content available on the largest mso platform in the u 
s and the other top ten largest cable msos in the us our improved content performance is primarily related to new content packages and recommended changes to our customers menu positioning 
revenue also improved from new international vod distribution 
the increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in revenue from the second largest cable mso in the us because the operator increased the retail price of content early in fiscal year and since the economic downturn  we believe consumers are less willing to pay the higher retail price 
although our year over year vod revenue has improved  we have experienced a decline in buy rates during the second half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half of the fiscal year which we believe is due to a general reduction in consumer spending from the weakening economic conditions 
the weaker economic conditions could continue to cause our vod service revenue to remain depressed or cause vod revenue to decline further 
revenue from our ppv services declined due to a reduction in revenue from the second largest dbs provider in the us believed to be attributable to an increase in the number of competitors on the platform and the impact of the recent economic downturn and related reduction in consumer spending 
also contributing to the decline was lower revenue from the other top ten largest cable msos in the us related to the economic downturn 
the revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue related to the addition of a new channel on the largest dbs platform in the us the impact from the economic downturn could continue to cause our ppv service revenue to remain depressed or cause the ppv revenue to decline further 

table of contents c band and other revenue declined because we ceased offering c band services after the service became unprofitable during the second half of fiscal year the revenue reflected in this product line now primarily reflects advertising revenue we receive for spots sold on our ppv channels 
although our transactional tv segment revenue increased in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year  revenue has trended lower in the second half of fiscal year as compared to the first half of fiscal year we believe this is a result of the increasingly difficult economic conditions and related reduction in consumer spending 
if the difficult economic conditions persist or worsen  our transactional tv segment results could also be materially adversely impacted 
generally  we believe our business has been and we expect will continue to be impacted by the downturn in the economy 
for our transactional tv segment  we are reliant on discretionary consumer purchases of our content 
when consumers spend less of their discretionary income on non essential expenses such as our content  it adversely impacts our business 
additionally  the price point of our content is significantly higher than both mainstream content and adult content that is distributed through other less expensive and free media such as the internet 
as a result  consumers that would otherwise purchase our content may opt to purchase less expensive mainstream content or obtain their adult entertainment through less expensive media such as the internet during an economic downturn 
although we believe that the deterioration in the economy has negatively impacted the transactional tv segment s results  it is not possible for us to quantify or reasonably estimate the financial impact 
we have remained focused on maintaining our competitive market position by offering a wide range of high quality content that we believe is superior to other product offerings in the industry 
we are currently in discussions with many of our largest customers to seek ways to encourage increased viewing of our content and to implement value added offers in order for our content to be more competitive with alternative media 
when considering the future operating results of the transactional tv segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact the segment s future operating results increased pressure from customers to reduce the revenue splits we receive or execute minimum guarantees or risk having those customers remove one or more channels from their platform  declines in new and existing customer buys of adult tv services due to a migration to other lower cost adult services such as the internet  adverse impacts to our business from a continued decline in discretionary consumer spending as a result of less favorable economic conditions  increased vod competition from established adult entertainment companies or new entrants to the category because the barriers of entry for this product line are low  challenges associated with our continued expansion into international markets and our inexperience with international customers  buy rates  and consumer habits  slowing growth of the overall adult entertainment category and limited incremental distribution opportunities within the us  and continued product commoditization 
in addition to the above noted risks  our agreements typically allow our customers to make significant changes to our distribution such as reduce the number of hours on the platform or remove one or more channels from the platform and may be terminated on relatively short notice without penalty 
for example  our agreement with directv may be terminated upon days notice to us 
we are currently negotiating with directv for a longer term agreement  but because revenue targets were 
table of contents not achieved under the current agreement it is possible that they may seek to remove one or more of our channels from their platform going forward 
if this occurs or if one or more of our cable mso or dbs operators changes our distribution terms  terminates or does not renew our agreements  or does not renew the agreements on terms as favorable as those of our current agreements  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
all the above mentioned challenges and risks  and others that we may not have identified  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevertheless  we believe that we are well positioned to mitigate the impact of these risks and challenges 
however  not all the risks and challenges can be managed by us because the ultimate outcome will be decided by other parties such as our customers 
during fiscal year and future periods  we believe that the transactional tv segment will experience revenue growth if we can successfully manage and are not materially adversely impacted by the challenges and risks previously mentioned 
we currently expect future growth in the segment to occur if we are successful with the following objectives continuing our international distribution expansion into new and existing geographic locations  increasing the proportional vod hours we receive on existing customer platforms  replacing our competitors ppv channels with our channels on both existing and new customer platforms  transitioning cable mso and dbs providers to less edited content standards  improving the value proposition for customers such as including limited term internet access to our content for each ppv or vod purchase  improving the vod user interfaces  and increasing the advertising revenue we receive from our ppv channels 
film production segment the film production segment has historically derived the majority of its revenue from two principal businesses the production and distribution of original motion pictures such as erotic thrillers  horror movies  and erotic  event styled content owned content  and the licensing of third party films in international and domestic markets where we act as a sales agent for the product repped content 
this segment also periodically provides contract film production services to certain major hollywood studios producer for hire arrangements 
the film markets have been significantly impacted by the economic downturn and as a result  the film production segment s customers have been reducing their content budgets 
these changes significantly impacted the film production segment operating results during the third quarter of fiscal year as a result  we made material revisions to the segment s internal forecasts and engaged a third party valuation firm to assist us in performing a goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis 
based on the analysis  we determined that the goodwill associated with the film production segment was impaired 
we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge for the quarter ended december  associated with this analysis 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that this segment will continue to experience pressure from the current unfavorable economic conditions which could cause the operating results to remain depressed or decline 
we generate revenue by licensing our owned content for a one time fee to premium tv services and through domestic and international distributors 
additionally  we leveraged our existing customer relationships with our transactional tv segment customers and license the film production segment owned content to domestic and international cable mso and dbs providers through revenue split arrangements that are structured in a similar manner to our transactional tv segment agreements 

table of contents the revenue splits we receive from cable mso and dbs providers for the film production segment content is higher than the revenue split we receive for our transactional tv segment content primarily due to the more mainstream nature of the content 
however  the retail price for our mainstream content is lower than our transactional tv segment content  and our per buy revenue is often the same as our transactional tv segment 
we also generate repped revenue through sales agency arrangements whereby we earn a sales commission and market fees by selling mainstream titles on behalf of film producers 
the film production segment has several well established relationships with certain independent mainstream filmmakers and licenses the rights to these filmmakers movies through its lightning entertainment group 
although the revenue is not yet meaningful to the film production segment  we have recently begun distribution of repped content titles to domestic retail dvd markets through a distribution partner 
we have also recently identified another opportunity to leverage our existing transactional tv segment customer relationships and have begun vod distribution of the mainstream repped content through several domestic cable msos 
we are optimistic that the mainstream repped content retail dvd and vod distribution revenue could become more meaningful in fiscal year our film production segment also infrequently acts as a producer for hire for major hollywood studios 
through these arrangements  we provide services and incur costs associated with the film production 
once the film has been delivered to the customer  we earn a fee for our services 
although we maintain no ownership rights for the produced content  we are responsible for the management and oversight of the production 
although we did not generate revenue in fiscal year from a producer for hire arrangement  we continue to pursue these opportunities and transactions and expect to generate revenue in fiscal year from such an arrangement 
our film production segment results experienced some seasonality prior to fiscal year because the sales team attends a large proportion of film trade shows just prior to and during the third fiscal quarter 
in the and fiscal years  we executed contracts that represented material revenue for the segment at those tradeshows 
we were able to subsequently deliver the related content for those contracts in the third fiscal quarter and as a result  our film production segment experienced higher revenue in that quarter 
during the current fiscal year ended march   the film production segment s third fiscal quarter revenue was significantly lower than the prior year third quarter results 
we believe the reduction in revenue is primarily due to the deterioration in the film markets 
film production segment revenue during the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year experienced the following trends owned content revenue declined we believe primarily due to unfavorable economic conditions within the film markets 
we believe the unfavorable economic conditions caused current and potential customers to reduce or eliminate acquisitions of our content in an effort to reduce spending which resulted in the execution of fewer owned content deals 
we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the film markets will continue to experience pressure from the unfavorable economic conditions which could cause the film production segment s revenue to remain depressed or decline 
repped content revenue also declined we believe primarily due to the above mentioned unfavorable economic conditions 
in addition to the negative impact the economic environment is having on revenue  we are also finding it more difficult to identify repped content that is higher quality and acceptable by our distributors because we believe producers are having difficulty obtaining financing for their productions due to contracted credit markets 

table of contents when considering the future operating results of the film production segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact this segment s operating results continuation of the unfavorable economic conditions and related reduction in our customers acquisition budgets for our owned and repped content  the identification and execution of owned content deals with premium movie channels could become less frequent  adverse impacts to our business from a continued decline in discretionary consumer spending as a result of less favorable economic conditions  declines in new and existing customer vod buys of our erotic owned content due to a migration to other lower cost adult services such as the internet  we are making larger producer advances and incurring more significant costs for repped content films with larger production budgets and we may be unable to recover these advances and costs through the future sale of the films  and increased competition to our owned content from more explicit adult film offerings 
the impact of these challenges and risks  and others that we may not have identified  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevertheless  we believe that we are well positioned to mitigate the impact of these risks and challenges 
however  not all the risks and challenges can be managed by us because the ultimate outcome will be decided by other parties such as our customers 
during fiscal year and in future periods  we will focus on improving the revenue we generate from this segment through the following strategic initiatives expanding the quantity of multi series owned content deals with premium movie channels  continuing the development of unique  original programming franchises  improving the buy rates of vod owned content on cable mso and dbs platforms through the same methods utilized by our transactional tv segment  increasing investments in higher quality titles that we represent through lightning entertainment group  generating meaningful repped content revenue by distributing higher quality titles through the dvd retail market  and generating meaningful repped content revenue by distributing higher quality titles through domestic cable msos 
direct to consumer segment our direct to consumer segment generates revenue primarily by selling memberships to our consumer websites 
during fiscal year  we experienced a decline in the direct to consumer segment revenue which we believe is due to a decline in consumer spending as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions as well as the availability of free and low cost internet content 
we recently launched a new version of our primary consumer website during fiscal year and are optimistic that the new primary website will result in improved performance during fiscal year the direct to consumer segment acquired certain intellectual property rights to an iptv set top box and other intangible assets in late fiscal year in an effort to expand the product lines that are delivered directly to consumers rather than through an intermediary such as a cable or satellite operator 
the intellectual property rights technology allows us to manufacture a device through which 
table of contents consumers can obtain content directly through the internet and view the content on television 
based primarily on a lower than expected subscriber additions for the iptv test business model during the second half of fiscal year  b the significant downturn in economic conditions and related reduction in consumer spending during the second half of fiscal year  and c slower than expected development of new product lines  we have restructured the operations of these new product lines to reduce future costs 
although we will continue to operate the iptv business model and other new direct to consumer product lines  we intend to materially change the nature of those operations and dedicate fewer resources towards marketing these products 
corporate administration segment the corporate administration segment reflects all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the transactional tv  film production  or direct to consumer operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal and accounting expenses  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs  and the sec  investor relations and printing costs associated with our public filings and shareholder communications 
our focus for this operating segment is balancing cost containment with the need for administrative support for the growth of the company 
we focus on reducing costs within this segment and expect to continue those efforts into fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments that the company uses in applying the accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that the company reports in its financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require the company to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company continuously evaluates its methods  estimates and judgments 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and considerations used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the recognition of revenue  the recognition and measurement of income tax expenses  assets and liabilities including the measurement of uncertain tax positions and valuation of deferred tax assets  the valuation of recoupable costs and producer advances  the assessment of film costs and the forecast of anticipated revenue ultimate revenue  which is used to amortize film costs  the amortization methodology and valuation of prepaid distribution rights  the valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  and the valuation and recognition of share based compensation 
each of these critical accounting policies is described in detail below 

table of contents revenue recognition the company s revenue consists primarily of fees earned through the electronic distribution of its licensed and owned content through various media outlets including msos  dbs providers  the internet and wireless platforms  premium movie channels  and other available media channels 
revenue also consists of fees earned through the licensing of third party content whereby the company acts as a sales agent for the film producer 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as is typically evidenced through an executed contract  the services have been rendered or delivery conditions as described in the related contract for the completed film have been satisfied  the license period related to film production segment arrangements has begun and the customer can begin exploitation of the content  the fee is fixed or determinable and its collection is reasonably assured 
the process involved in evaluating the appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgment including estimating monthly revenue based on historical data and determining collectability of fees 
transactional tv segment vod and ppv services the transactional tv segment s vod and ppv revenue are recognized based on buys and monthly subscriber counts reported each month by cable msos  dbs providers and hospitality providers 
the actual monthly sales information is not typically reported to the transactional tv segment until approximately days after the month of service 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the transactional tv segment s historical experience with each customer 
the revenue may be subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt of the monthly sales reports 
transactional tv segment advertising revenue from the advertising of products on the company s ppv networks is recognized upon sale of the related advertised product  as reported by the company s third party partners 
revenue from spot advertising is recognized in the month the spot is run on the transactional tv segment s networks 
transactional tv segment c band services the company ceased its c band services offering during the third quarter of fiscal year prior to removing this product offering  c band network services were sold through customer subscriptions that ranged from a one month period to a three month period 
revenue associated with these services was recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
film production segment owned content licensing revenue from the licensing of owned content is recognized consistent with the provisions of statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films 
in accordance with that provision  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists as is typically evidenced through an executed contract  the delivery conditions of the completed film have been satisfied as required in the contract  the license period of the arrangement has begun  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
for agreements that involve the distribution of content to the home video market  ppv market and vod market  the company is unable to determine or reasonably estimate the fees earned from customers in advance of receiving the reported earnings because the market acceptance varies unpredictably by film and from period to period 
as a result  the company s share of licensing revenue from these arrangements is not recognized until the amounts are reported by the customers 

table of contents film production segment repped content licensing in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company recognizes revenue from represented film licensing activities on a net basis as an agent 
the revenue recognized for these transactions represents only the sales agency fee earned by the company on the total licensing fee 
the producers share of the licensing fee is recorded as a liability by the company until the balance is remitted to the producer 
the agreements entered into with the producers may also provide for a marketing fee that can be earned by the company 
the marketing fee is stated as a fixed amount and is earned by the company as collections from film licensing fees are received 
the company recognizes marketing fees as revenue when the amounts become determinable and the collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
direct to consumer segment membership fees revenue from membership fees is recognized over the life of the membership 
the company records an allowance for refunds based on expected membership cancellations  credits and chargebacks 
income taxes the company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining its income tax provision expense 
these estimates and judgments are used in the determination of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which are a result of differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
the company also uses estimates and judgments in determining interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates could result in a material change to the company s tax provision in subsequent periods 
the company is required to evaluate the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if the company s evaluation determines that the recovery is unlikely  it would be required to increase the provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets equal to the amount that is not expected to be recoverable 
the company currently estimates that its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if these estimates were to change and the company s assessment indicated it would be unable to recover the deferred tax assets  the company would be required to increase its income tax provision expense in the period of the change in estimate 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of tax regulations 
effective at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter of  the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position liabilities accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this process is based on various factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts and circumstances  changes in tax law  settlement of issues under audit  and new audit activity 
changes to these factors and the company s estimates regarding these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

table of contents recoupable costs and producer advances recoupable costs and producer advances represent amounts paid by the company that are expected to be subsequently recouped through the collection of fees associated with the company s licensing of repped content 
in connection with the film production segment s repped content operations  the company enters into sales agency agreements whereby the company acts as a sales agent for a producer s film sales agency agreements 
these sales agency agreements typically include provisions whereby certain costs that are incurred for promotion related activities will be paid by the company on behalf of the producer such as movie trailer and ad material costs 
the company may also pay the producer an advance for the related film prior to the distribution of such film 
as the company subsequently licenses the producer s film and license fees are collected  the recoupable costs and producer advances are recovered by the company through these license fee collections 
license fees typically are not paid to the producer of the related film until such recoupable costs and producer advances have been fully recovered by the company 
the company evaluates recoupable costs and producer advances for impairment on a quarterly basis based on estimates of future license fee collections 
an impairment of these assets could occur if company estimates indicated that it would be unable to collect fees from the licensing of a film sufficient to recover the related outstanding recoupable costs and producer advances 
during each fiscal year ended march  and  the company incurred impairment charges related to recoupable costs and producer advances of million 
no material impairment charges were incurred during the fiscal year ended march  the impairment charges are recorded in the charge for restructuring and asset impairments other than goodwill line item within the consolidated statements of operations 
film costs the company capitalizes its share of film costs in accordance with sop film costs include costs to develop and produce films  which primarily consist of salaries  equipment and overhead costs  as well as the cost to acquire rights to films 
film costs include amounts for completed films and films still in development 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of the films 
interest expense associated with film costs is not capitalized because the duration of productions is short term in nature 
films are typically direct to television in nature 
film costs are stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value 
film costs are reviewed for impairment on a title by title basis each quarterly reporting period 
the company records an impairment charge when the fair value of the title is less than the unamortized cost 
examples of events or circumstances that could result in an impairment charge for film costs include a an unexpected less favorable film title or event performance on a mso platform or b a downward adjustment in the estimated future performance of a film title or event due to an adverse change to the general business climate as was experienced during the third quarter of fiscal year future adjustments associated with film cost valuations could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations in future periods 
capitalized film costs are recognized as an expense within cost of sales using the film forecast method 
under this method  capitalized film costs are expensed based on the proportion of the film s revenue recognized for such period relative to the film s estimated remaining ultimate revenue  not to exceed ten years 
ultimate revenue is the estimated total revenue expected to be recognized over a film s useful life 
ultimate revenue for new film titles and events is typically estimated using actual historical performance of comparable films that are similar in nature such as production cost and genre 
film revenue associated with this method includes amounts from all sources on an individual film forecast computation method  as defined by sop estimates of ultimate revenue are reviewed quarterly and adjusted if appropriate  and amortization is also adjusted on a prospective basis for such a change in estimate 
changes in estimated ultimate revenue could be due to a variety of 
table of contents factors  including the proportional buy rates of the content as compared to competitive content as well as the level of market acceptance of the television product 
prepaid distribution rights the transactional tv segments content library consists of film licensing agreements 
the company capitalizes the costs associated with the licenses as well as certain editing costs and amortizes these capitalized costs on a straight line basis over the term of the licensing agreement generally years 
under the applicable accounting literature  costs associated with such license agreements should be amortized using a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the related film revenue is expected to be recognized 
the company amortizes the cost of prepaid distribution rights on a straight line basis because each usage of the film is expected to generate similar revenue and the revenue for the films is expected to be recognized ratably over the related license term 
the company regularly reviews and evaluates the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis as opposed to an alternative method of amortization such as an accelerated basis 
based on these analyses  the company has determined that the amortization of the film library costs using a straight line basis most accurately reflects the manner in which the revenue for the related films will be recognized 
the company periodically reviews the content library and assesses whether the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the libraries based on expected forecast results 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film libraries  the company will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets the company records goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill not to be amortized but tested for impairment at the operating segment level on an annual basis march for the company and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using considerations of various valuation methodologies which could include income and market valuation approaches 
the income approach involves discounting the reporting unit s projected free cash flow at its weighted average cost of capital  and the market approach considers comparable publicly traded company valuations and recent merger and acquisition valuations 
the analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth  determination of the weighted average cost of capital  and other similar estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
the company allocates goodwill to each operating segment based on the operating segment expected to benefit from the related acquisition and or combination 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting segments and consolidated company  a reconciliation of the fair value estimates for the reporting segments to the company s market capitalization was performed as of march  the reconciliation considered a reasonable control premium based on merger and acquisition transactions within the media and entertainment industry and other available information 
based on the reconciliation  the company s fair value is in excess of its market capitalization and there is no indicator of additional goodwill 
table of contents impairment 
a control premium is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
the premium is justified by the expected synergies  such as the expected increase in cash flow resulting from cost savings and revenue enhancements 
other identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization primarily include amounts paid to acquire non compete agreements with certain key executives  contractual and non contractual customer relationships  intellectual property rights  patents and websites 
these costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which is typically five years 
intangible asset balances are removed from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts in the period in which they become fully amortized and are no longer in use 
the company continually reviews long lived assets that are held and used and identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets  the company considers whether the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets is less than the related assets carrying value and if so  the company records an impairment loss for the excess recorded carrying value of the asset as compared to its fair value 
employee equity incentive plans the company has employee equity incentive plans  which are described more fully in note employee equity incentive plans 
effective april   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r

net revenue vod revenue from the largest mso in the us increased approximately million during the year ended march  due to our improved content performance and from a related increase in the quantity of content available on the platform 
also contributing to the increase was an overall performance improvement on several of the other top ten largest cable msos in the us our improved content performance is primarily related to new content packages and recommended changes to our customers menu positioning 
the fiscal year results also included approximately million of incremental international revenue 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a million decline in revenue from the second largest cable mso in the us because the operator increased the retail price of content during fiscal year and since the economic downturn  we believe consumers are less willing to purchase content at the higher retail price 
the fiscal year results included approximately million in additional revenue associated with settling paid and unpaid historical amounts with a domestic mso customer 
through our monthly review procedures  we had identified inconsistent past payment trends with the related mso and subsequently participated in a joint research analysis with the mso to resolve the historical issues 
we subsequently entered into an arrangement based on the analysis and agreed that any historical billings and payments were resolved 
the settlement of the outstanding balances completed the earning process for the net balance of million and in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concurrently recognized the amount as domestic vod revenue 
we also made recommendations to the related mso regarding process changes to prevent similar future reporting issues  and we believe the issues that gave rise to the adjustment are isolated to the related mso and do not expect similar future material adjustments 

table of contents vod revenue within the transactional tv segment increased during fiscal year as compared to as a result of an improvement in the performance of our content on the largest us cable mso related to modifications in the content combinations we provide on that platform 
ppv the decline in ppv revenue during the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to a million reduction in revenue from the second largest dbs provider in the us due to an increase in the number of competitors on the platform and a reduction in consumer spending related to the economic downturn 
also contributing to the decline was lower revenue from other top ten largest cable msos in the us also due to the economic downturn 
we believe consumers that have historically purchased our content with discretionary income are reducing or eliminating their acquisition of our content or viewing adult content through less expensive alternatives such as the internet in response to the economic downturn 
partially offsetting the revenue decline was an increase in revenue of approximately million from the addition of a new channel on the largest dbs platform in the us ppv revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to as a result of million of lower revenue from the second largest dbs provider in the us following the renegotiation of our contract with that customer in the third quarter of fiscal year we receive a lower revenue split under the terms of the new contract 
concurrent with the renegotiation of this contract  two additional competitive channels were added to the same customer platform which also resulted in a decline in revenue 
revenue from the largest dbs platform in the us was flat in fiscal year as compared to although we added an additional channel to that platform during the third quarter of fiscal year  the increase in revenue from the additional channel was offset by a reduction in the per channel revenue we received on the platform 
our per channel revenue declined primarily because competitive adult channels were added to the platform 
c band and other revenue the decline in c band and other revenue during the fiscal year ended march  was from lower c band revenue because we ceased offering these services during the third quarter of fiscal year c band and other revenue also declined during fiscal year as compared to due to customer conversions from c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller digital dbs satellite systems  and because we ceased offering the c band service during the third quarter of fiscal year we ceased offering the c band service as a result of the continued deterioration in subscribers 
we did not incur any material costs associated with removing this service offering 
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of expenses associated with our digital broadcast center  satellite uplinking  satellite transponder leases  programming acquisitions  vod transport  and amortization of content licenses 
these costs also included in house call center operations related to the c band services that we ceased offering during the third quarter of fiscal year cost of sales increased during fiscal year due to a a million increase in transport costs to support the increase in us vod distribution  b a million increase in transponder costs to support additional ppv channel offerings  and c a million increase in prepaid distribution amortization expense associated with licensing higher quality content to attract additional customer purchases 
the increase in cost of sales was partially offset by a million decline in costs related to the termination of the c band services and a reduction in employee expenses from cost reduction efforts 

table of contents cost of sales was lower during fiscal year as compared to due a million decline in expenses related to the cancellation of the transponder service used to distribute our plz network formerly known as pleasure and a million decline in expenses from ceasing to offer our c band service 
the decline in costs was partially offset by an increase in vod transport fees related to the execution of a less favorable amended contract with a transport provider in early fiscal year operating expenses and operating income the increase in operating expenses during the fiscal year ended march  was due to higher advertising and promotion costs of approximately million which were incurred in connection with efforts to increase domestic revenue 
this increase in costs was partially offset by a million reduction in expenses associated with equipment and tenant improvement disposition and impairment charges that were incurred in the prior fiscal year but did not recur in fiscal year operating income for the fiscal years ended march  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses during fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to a a million increase in costs associated with promotion and marketing activities for new channel launches  b a million loss for the early disposition of equipment used within our digital broadcast center  c the impact from writing off million in tenant improvements associated with a prospective facility that proved inadequate for our requirements  and d a million increase in employee related costs necessary to improve the segment s it infrastructure 
the increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in certain prior year advertising costs that were incurred in an effort to improve buy rates on distribution platforms

table of contents net revenue owned content the revenue decline experienced during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to fiscal year was due to a a million decline in revenue from a large ppv aggregator that no longer distributes our content  b a million decline in revenue from the largest dbs provider in the us because our content was moved to a more competitive location within that provider s electronic programming guide  c a million decline in certain horror film revenue generated through an arrangement with a mainstream film distributor due to less favorable film performance  and d a general decline in revenue believed to be due to unfavorable economic conditions in the film markets during the second half of the current fiscal year 
we believe the unfavorable economic conditions caused potential customers to reduce or eliminate acquisitions of our content in an effort to reduce spending which resulted in the execution of fewer owned content deals 
we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the film markets will continue to experience unfavorable economic conditions which could cause the film production segment s revenue to remain depressed or decline 
the decline in owned content revenue during the current fiscal year was partially offset by a million increase in revenue from new vod distribution on us cable platforms 
the decrease in owned content revenue during fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to a decline in the number of large customer agreements that were executed during fiscal year revenue also declined approximately million during fiscal year due to lower revenue from a large ppv aggregator and approximately million due to lower revenue from the largest dbs platform in the us due to an unfavorable change in the license fee structure with that customer and from a change in the placement of our content on that platform s electronic platform guide 
these declines in revenue were partially offset by an increase in vod revenue of approximately million from our distribution of content on six major us cable platforms 
repped content repped content revenue includes revenue from the licensing of film titles that we represent but do not own under domestic and international sales agency relationships with various independent film producers 
the decline in repped content revenue during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is believed to be due to the impact of unfavorable economic conditions on the independent film market consistent with the conditions described above within the owned content revenue discussion 
the revenue from our repped content was flat during fiscal year as compared to other revenue other revenue relates to amounts earned through producer for hire arrangements  music royalty fees and the delivery of other miscellaneous film materials to distributors 
other revenue declined in fiscal year as compared to because we did not generate revenue from a producer for hire arrangement during the current fiscal year 
the increase in other revenue during fiscal year as compared to is due to our completion of a producer for hire arrangement with a major hollywood studio during that fiscal year 
we will pursue producer for hire opportunities in the future and expect to complete a producer for hire production in fiscal year cost of sales our cost of sales is primarily comprised of the amortization of our owned content film costs as well as delivery and distribution costs related to that content 
these expenses also include the costs we incur to provide producer for hire services 
there is no significant cost of sales related to the repped content services 

table of contents the decline in cost of sales during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a a million decline in costs related to a producer for hire deal that occurred during the prior fiscal year but did not recur during the current fiscal year  and b a decline in film cost amortization related to the decline in owned content revenue 
film cost amortization as a percentage of the related owned content revenue during the fiscal years ended march  and was and  respectively 
the decline in cost of sales during fiscal year was primarily related a million reduction in film cost amortization associated with the decline in owned content revenue and from the monetization of films that were produced after the acquisition of this segment in films that were produced prior to the mrg acquisition typically have a higher cost of sales because they were recorded at fair value when we acquired mrg 
also contributing to the decline in film cost amortization was the delivery of older titles whose film costs had been fully amortized in prior periods 
film cost amortization as a percentage of the related owned content revenue for fiscal year and was and  respectively 
the decrease in costs was partially offset by an increase in cost of sales from expenses realized in connection with the completion of a producer for hire arrangement 
operating expenses and operating income loss operating expenses increased during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a a million goodwill impairment charge  and b a million impairment charge for certain owned content film and event costs 
an additional discussion of the goodwill and film cost impairment charges is provided below 
the fiscal year ended march  operating expenses included a million charge incurred to impair the value of two film event costs which was partially offset by the reversal of million in net earn out accrual expenses that had been previously accrued but were reversed because the former principals of mrg did not achieve the required performance targets 
the film production segment incurred approximately million of impairment charges for certain recoupable costs and producer advances that were determined to be unrecoupable in each of the fiscal years ended march  and the film production segment s operating loss was million for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to operating income of million during the fiscal year ended march  operating expenses increased in fiscal year primarily as a result of a million impairment charge incurred for two owned content film events 
see additional discussion of the film cost impairment charges below 
operating expenses were also higher during fiscal year due to a a million recoupable costs and producer advances impairment charge recorded for repped content costs that were determined to be unrecoupable  b a million bad debt write off related to an uncollectible customer account  and c a million increase in trade show exhibition costs 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in costs associated with an earn out that was incurred in fiscal year but did not recur in fiscal year because certain performance targets were not achieved in fiscal year operating income in each of the fiscal years ended march  and was million 
goodwill and film cost impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal year  we determined that continued adverse changes in the business climate and material revisions to the film production segment s internal forecasts based on lower than expected revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year were events that could indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company therefore determined an impairment test as of december  was appropriate and engaged an independent firm to assist in performing the impairment test 
the income and market valuation approaches were considered in determining the estimated fair value of the film production segment 
the income approach involves discounting the reporting unit s projected free cash 
table of contents flow at its weighted average cost of capital 
for the market approach  we considered comparable publicly traded company valuations and recent merger and acquisition valuations 
using these methods  we determined that the estimated fair value of the film production segment was less than its carrying value at december  as required under sfas no 
 we then performed additional analysis to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
we determined the implied fair value of the goodwill by first allocating the estimated fair value of the film production segment to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the operating segment 
the excess of the estimated fair value over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on this analysis  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce the film production segment s goodwill from million to the implied fair value of goodwill of million 
the goodwill impairment was primarily due to significantly lower than expected performance of the film production segment during the quarter ended december  and a subsequent significant downward revision to the segment s three year internal forecasts 
the decline in performance and estimated future internal forecasts is due to the previously discussed general deterioration in the film production and distribution markets 
we also recorded a non cash impairment expense during fiscal year of approximately million associated with several film production segment owned content films and events 
during the third quarter of fiscal year and as part of our process to continually assess the expected performance of owned content  we determined that downward adjustments to the estimated performance of films and events should be recorded as a result of adverse changes to the business climate as discussed above 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million representing the difference in the unamortized film costs and the estimated fair value of the films and events 
this difference was recorded as an asset impairment charge within the film production segment s operating expenses 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a non cash impairment expense of approximately million associated with two film production segment owned content events 
the events were originally valued when we acquired mrg in during the quarter ended december   we obtained initial revenue data that indicated the actual performance of the events would not meet the original estimates that were established when we acquired mrg 
as a result  we lowered our estimate of the expected future benefits to be derived from these events and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million representing the difference in the unamortized film costs and the estimated fair value of the events

net revenue net membership net membership revenue during the fiscal year ended march  was consistent with fiscal year net membership revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to as a result of fewer new memberships because our resources were dedicated to rebuilding our consumer websites and as a result  our marketing efforts were not as robust 
other revenue other revenue primarily relates to the sale of content to other webmasters  the distribution of our website to the lodgenet entertainment corporation customer base  and revenue from the distribution of our content through wireless platforms 
other revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to we believe primarily because of the general economic downturn and a related reduction in spending by our customers

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales primarily consists of expenses associated with credit card processing  bandwidth  traffic acquisition  content and depreciation of assets 
these costs also include expenses incurred in connection with our test iptv business model and other new product initiatives which primarily include employee  depreciation  amortization and travel costs 
the direct to consumer segment s cost of sales increased during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year due to additional costs incurred for the test iptv business model 
the direct to consumer segment s cost of sales declined by million in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year due to a million reduction in wireless distribution expenses because we reduced the resources dedicated to wireless activities 
also contributing to the decline was lower amortization expense associated with the write off of a licensed content library during the third quarter of fiscal year operating expenses and operating loss operating expenses increased to million during fiscal year as compared to million in the prior fiscal year due to the following a million in intangible asset impairment charges  b million in restructuring charges associated with the early termination of certain consulting contracts  c million in expenses associated with settling an outstanding claim with a vendor  and d an increase in operating costs associated with the set top box initiative 
see additional discussion of the intangible assets and restructuring charges below 
we incurred an operating loss of million and million during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
operating expenses declined in fiscal year as compared to from a million reduction in employee costs related to wireless activities 
operating expenses were also lower because fiscal year amounts included a million licensed content impairment expense and a million asset impairment expense for certain distribution software 
these impairment charges did not recur in fiscal year the declines in operating expenses were partially offset by a million increase in costs from our efforts to update and improve our consumer websites and from additional employee costs associated with efforts to establish the test iptv business model 
we incurred operating losses during the fiscal years ended march  and of million and million  respectively 
intangible assets and restructuring charges the direct to consumer segment acquired certain intellectual property rights to an iptv set top box and other intangible assets in late fiscal year in an effort to expand the product lines that are delivered directly to consumers 
the intellectual property rights technology allows us to manufacture a device through which consumers can obtain content directly through the internet and view the content on television 
based primarily on a lower than expected subscriber additions for the iptv test business model during the second half of fiscal year  b the significant downturn in economic conditions and related reduction in consumer spending during the second half of fiscal year  and c slower than expected development of new product lines  we have restructured the direct to consumer segment operations as it relates to these new product lines 
although we will continue to operate the iptv business model and other new direct to consumer product lines  we intend to materially change the nature of those operations and dedicate fewer resources towards marketing and generating revenue for these products 
based on these events and our analysis of the future expected benefits to be derived from these assets  we determined that certain intangible assets associated with the related new product lines were impaired and recorded a million non cash intangible asset impairment charge 
additionally  several contracts were cancelled prior to the end of the related term in connection with the restructuring and as a result  we incurred an early contract 
table of contents termination fee of approximately million which was paid in april we do not expect to incur additional costs or cash outlays associated with this restructuring in the future 
corporate administration the following table sets forth certain financial information for the corporate administration segment for each of the three fiscal years presented in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs operating expenses expenses related to the corporate administration segment include all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  which are not directly allocable to the transactional tv  film production  or direct to consumer segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal and accounting expenses  human resources and training  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs and the sec  investor relations  and printing costs associated with our public filings and shareholder communications 
corporate administration expenses were lower in fiscal year primarily due to a million decline in employee costs primarily related to a reduction in executive bonus accruals and from lower legal and human resource costs of million related to organizational improvements 
the reduction in costs was partially offset by an increase in third party advisor fees of approximately million and higher stock option expenses from grants that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal year corporate administration costs increased in fiscal year due to an increase in employee costs of approximately million which included additional expenses primarily for a sales executive whose function is to sell products across all segments these employee costs were previously associated with the wireless activities within the direct to consumer segment and an increase in costs associated with the hiring of a chief technology and information officer in february these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in external legal fees and a decline in bonus accruals 
liquidity and capital resources our current priorities for the use of our cash are investments in processes intended to improve the quality and marketability of our products  funding our operating and capital requirements  and funding  from time to time  opportunities to enhance shareholder value  whether in the form of repurchase of shares of our common stock  cash dividends or other strategic transactions  although we do not currently have foreseeable plans to participate in such opportunities 
we anticipate that our existing cash and investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient in the next fiscal year to satisfy our operating requirements 
we also anticipate that we will be able to fund our estimated outlay for capital expenditures  new content licensing  film production costs and other related purchases that may occur in fiscal year through our available existing cash and investments  our expected cash flows from operations during the next fiscal year and available borrowing facilities 
our line of credit matures in july although we have no current indication that the related bank will not extend the term of our line of credit  the recent deterioration in the credit markets could result in our inability to extend the term of the line of credit

as of march   there is a million outstanding balance under the existing line of credit 
we have approximately million of available cash and investments as of march  we believe that if a we are unable to draw down additional funds through our line of credit  b we were required to pay down the existing line of credit or c we were unable to extend the term of the line of credit beyond july  we could sufficiently satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months utilizing our available cash  investments and estimated cash generated through operations in fiscal year cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our cash flows from operating and investing activities for each of the three fiscal years presented are as follows amounts in table may not sum due to rounding in millions year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows from investing activities payment for business acquisitions  net of cash acquired purchase of marketable securities redemption of marketable securities purchases of equipment and furniture purchase of intangible assets payment of related party note arising from business acquisition net cash provided by used in investing activities cash flows from operating activities the changes in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year primarily reflect the following a million increase in cash flows from improved efficiencies related to the collection of accounts receivable in our transactional tv and film production segments  a million increase in cash flows from the decline in owned content creation within the film production segment  a million increase in cash flows arising primarily from lower employee bonus payments made during the first quarter of fiscal year as compared to the same prior year quarter  a million decline in cash flows from recoupable costs incurred to obtain higher quality repped content to support existing repped content sales and our new initiatives to distribute repped content through retail dvd and vod markets  and a decline in cash flows primarily associated with unfavorable performance within the film production segment and additional spending to support the direct to consumer segment s set top box initiative 
cash flows from operating activities during fiscal year were significantly higher as compared to the operating loss incurred in fiscal year as a result of non cash goodwill  intangible and other 
table of contents asset impairment charges 
if the economic environment worsens  it is reasonably possible that we may be required to incur similar non cash impairment charges in the future 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year as compared to is primarily related to the following a million decrease in net income  a reduction in cash flows generated by the film production segment as reflected in the million decline in that segment s depreciation and amortization and the million increase in cash used for film production  and a million impact from cash paid for employee compensation 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal year we received approximately million of cash from net redemptions of marketable securities 
approximately million of cash was used for capital expenditures primarily to acquire additional electronic storage equipment for our transactional tv segment and to upgrade certain administrative hardware and software  such as our financial reporting system 
we also used approximately million to purchase intangible assets within our direct to consumer segment 
we expect cash used for capital expenditures and intangible asset purchases to be lower in fiscal year and will primarily consist of purchases necessary to retain our current infrastructure service level and support the international distribution growth within the transactional tv segment 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities during fiscal year is primarily related to the net million of cash received from the redemption of marketable securities 
this cash was primarily used to pay quarterly shareholder dividends and for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock at an average price of per share through our stock repurchase program as reflected in the financing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows discussed below 
capital expenditures of million primarily relate to purchases of servers and editing equipment to maintain our digital broadcast center and computers  and we paid million primarily related to our purchase of the intellectual property rights of for the iptv set top boxes

net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year cash disbursements in fiscal year primarily included capital expenditures for the purchase of editing equipment  computers  servers  software  encryption equipment for new cable launches  a storage area network system  and an archival storage system

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year reflects million in payments for quarterly cash dividends and million for the purchase of approximately million shares of common stock through our stock repurchase plan 
this use of cash was slightly offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the excess tax shortfall benefit relates to the tax deductions that we received upon exercise of an option by an employee or non employee director in excess of those anticipated at the time of the option grant  and amounts were immaterial in fiscal year net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year primarily includes the payment of a special dividend in the amount of per share  or million  in february we also used million of cash to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock during the quarter ended september  at an average price of per share 
these cash disbursements were partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year and an excess tax benefit of million related to tax deductions we received upon the exercise of options by employees and non employee directors 
stock repurchase and cash dividends in june  our board of directors extended a share repurchase plan allowing for the repurchase of approximately million shares of common stock through june during the six month period ended september   we substantially completed the share repurchase plan and repurchased approximately million shares for a total purchase price of approximately million 
on november   we entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which a shareholder agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock for a cash purchase price of per share or an aggregate purchase price for all of the shares of approximately million 
we funded the acquisition of the shares with available cash 
on march   we purchased through one broker in an unsolicited single block trade approximately million shares of our common stock for a cash purchase price of per share  or an aggregate purchase price for all of the shares of approximately million

the acquisition was approved by our board of directors and was effected 
table of contents in a manner intended to comply with the safe harbor provisions provided by rule b under the securities exchange act of on december   our board of directors declared a special dividend of per share 
we paid this dividend in february to shareholders of record on january  during each of the quarters in fiscal year  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
we paid approximately million in cash dividends through march  additionally  as of march   we had a dividend payable of million that was subsequently paid in april the board of directors did not declare a quarterly dividend during fiscal year  and the payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors 
although we are under no obligation and currently have no plans to effect any further stock repurchases or dividends  we may seek to make additional repurchases from time to time as market conditions warrant  through open market purchases  negotiated transactions  or in such other manner as may be deemed appropriate by us and our board of directors 
additionally  we will also continue to evaluate other available methods to enhance shareholder value  whether in the form of cash dividends or otherwise 
borrowing arrangements in july  we obtained a million line of credit from a third party financial institution 
amounts borrowed under the line of credit can be used to support our short term working capital needs 
the line of credit is secured by our trade accounts receivable and will mature in july per the contractual loan agreement  borrowings under the line of credit are based on the greater of the current prime rate less or 
the terms of the line of credit include certain defined negative and affirmative covenants customary for facilities of this type  and we were in compliance with the covenants at march  we made borrowings under the line of credit during the third quarter of fiscal year to support our working capital needs  and the outstanding balance as of march  was million 
commitments and contingencies contractual cash obligations the following table reflects our contractual cash obligations as of march  for each of the fiscal year time periods specified amounts may not sum due to rounding payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligations vendor obligations line of credit employment contract obligations total for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  such as fixed or minimum services to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations to acquire specified quantities of movie license rights that are subject to the delivery of the related movies are included in vendor obligations because we estimate that the movies will be delivered in the specified time periods 
we maintain non cancelable leases for office space and equipment under various operating leases 
the leases for office space expire through november and contain annual consumer price index 
table of contents escalation clauses 
our transactional tv segment has entered into direct lease agreements that expire through december with an unrelated party for the use of transponders to broadcast its channels on satellites 
as the lessee of transponders under the transponder agreements  we are subject to arbitrary refusal of service by the service provider if that service provider determines that the content being transmitted by us is harmful to the service provider s name or business 
any such service disruption would substantially and adversely affect the financial position and results of operations 
we also bear the risk that the access of their networks to transponders may be restricted or denied if a governmental authority commences an investigation concerning the content of the transmissions 
additionally  cable operators may be reluctant to carry less edited or partially edited adult programming on their systems 
if either of the above scenarios occurred  it could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we had no equipment under capital lease at march  or from time to time  we enter into arrangements with movie studios to acquire license rights for a fixed and or minimum quantity of movies over various purchase periods as defined by the agreements 
additionally  we are party to certain uplinking  transport and marketing services that contractually obligate us to receive services over specified terms as per these arrangements 
we are also obligated to make future payments associated with our purchase of intellectual property and patent rights 
these contractual obligations are reflected in the above table as vendor obligations 
we have recorded long term income taxes payable of million for uncertain tax positions  reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments  if any  related to these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  the amounts have been excluded from the above table 
uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 we had total unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million at march  that are not expected to be settled within one year and have been classified within long term taxes payable 
if we were to prevail or the uncertainties were settled in our favor for all uncertain tax positions  the net effect is estimated to be a benefit to tax expense of approximately million 
as of march   we had accrued immaterial amounts of interest expense related to uncertain tax position liabilities 
during fiscal year  the statute of limitations expired on approximately million of uncertain tax positions resulting in a decline in the uncertain tax position balance as reflected in the current portion of taxes payable
