item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue primarily through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s principal business consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
on august   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell a substantial portion of the assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  pinnacle technologies  inc pinnacle  to halliburton energy services  inc halliburton 
the sale  which includes all of the fracture and reservoir diagnostic business  the pinnacle name and related trademarks  was completed on october  the company has no continuing involvement in these operations 
the assets and liabilities related to this transaction have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition  operations associated with these assets have been classified as income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and the cash flows associated with discontinued operations have been segregated in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company retained the hydraulic fracturing simulation software fracpropt  the hydraulic fracturing design  engineering and consulting business and applied geomechanics  inc  a provider of geotechnical monitoring applications 
previously  the pinnacle assets and operations were presented in the fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment  one of the company s two reportable segments 
segment information is no longer presented because the remaining operations  which were previously 
table of contents reported in the fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment  do not meet the quantitative threshold for a reportable segment 
the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
however  the company has increased its revenues and income over an extended period and across various industry business cycles by increasing its share of the worldwide market for all types of proppant 
while the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects will benefit from both an expected increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to improve production results and lower their overall development costs 
in recent years  the company has expanded its operations outside the united states 
in  the company constructed its first manufacturing facility located outside the united states in the city of luoyang  china and completed a second production line in that doubled the capacity of that facility 
in  the company also opened a sales office in moscow  russia and established distribution operations in the country 
in  the company broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in the city of kopeysk  russia and completed construction of this new facility during the first half of the company believes international operations will continue to represent an important role in its future growth 
revenue growth in recent years has been driven largely by increases in ceramic proppant sales volume 
because ceramic proppant is used on less than percent of fractures worldwide  the company believes there is significant potential for growth in the future 
as a result  the company has expanded its proppant manufacturing capacity by approximately over a four year period and has more than tripled its production capacity since because the company s ceramic proppants compete in part against lower cost alternatives  the company expects its future revenue growth to be derived from increasing sales volume more so than from an increase in the selling price of ceramic proppant 
management believes the addition of new manufacturing capacity is critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue for ceramic proppant 
in regards to future expansion  the company is currently constructing a third production line at its toomsboro facility that is expected to be completed in early with an annual capacity of million pounds 
while the company has operated near or at full capacity at times during the previous ten years  the addition of significant new capacity could adversely impact operating profit margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
operating profit margin for the company s proppant business is principally impacted by manufacturing costs and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
while most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  the company has experienced recent volatility in the cost of natural gas  which is used in production by the company s domestic manufacturing facilities  and bauxite  which is the primary raw material for production of the company s high strength ceramic proppant 
the cost of natural gas has varied from approximately to of total monthly direct production expense over the last three years due to price volatility of this fuel source 
in an effort to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas purchases and reduce exposure to short term spikes in the price of this commodity  the company contracts in advance for portions of its future natural gas requirements 
during  the company s long standing supplier of high strength raw materials exited the business 
the company has experienced an increase in the cost of high strength raw materials as it seeks alternative suitable suppliers in other parts of the world 
these materials are used to manufacture high strength products  carboprop and carbohsp  at the new iberia  louisiana and mcintyre  georgia facilities 
the delivered cost of bauxite  which represents approximately half of the cost of high strength products  increased during and remained high during management continues to pursue a long term source of these materials to complement its strong position in lightweight raw material supplies 
despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices and the cost of high strength raw materials  it is possible that  given the significant 
table of contents portion of manufacturing costs represented by these items  gross margins as a percentage of sales may continue to decline and changes in net income may not directly correlate to changes in revenue 
as the company has expanded its operations in both domestic and international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities globally  improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  and focusing on new product development 
the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue  however selling  general and administrative expenses may continue to increase in from levels as the company continues to expand its operations 
general business conditions the company s proppant business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america  where the majority of wells are hydraulically fractured 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on comparing the higher initial costs to the future value derived from increased production and recovery rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
worldwide oil and natural gas prices and related drilling activity levels remained very strong from until late in addition in early  the company introduced a new product  carbohydroprop tm  a lower priced ceramic proppant designed to be cost competitive with resin coated sand 
this new product has been very well received in the north american marketplace 
consequently  in years through  the company benefited from the additional production capacity from its toomsboro  georgia manufacturing facility and established new records for sales volume  revenue and net income 
despite this increase  the company s ability to sell additional ceramic proppant in was limited by its production capacity and  as such  the company commenced planning construction of a third million pound production line at its toomsboro  georgia manufacturing plant 
during the second half of  oil and natural gas prices declined significantly in connection with declines in many of the world s economies 
as a result  the number of active drilling rigs in north america declined as well 
while difficult to predict  the company believes this reduction in oil and gas prices and drilling activity will be short term in duration and does not expect a long term impact for the company s products and services 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
while sales volumes in international markets increased in  international sales as a percentage of total sales declined as a result of proportionately high sales volume in the united states 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer generally upon delivery of products or at the time services are performed 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in trade accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of collectability risk and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of 
table of contents trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectability based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by a material amount 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
during the second quarter of  the company changed its method of accounting for inventories from the first in  first out fifo method to the weighted average cost method 
the company believes that the weighted average cost method more appropriately reflects costs in relation to the physical movement of bulk processed finished goods 
a change in accounting method requires retroactive application and thus restatement of all prior periods presented 
however  this change in inventory costing method did not result in a material cumulative difference or a material difference in any one reporting period  and consequently the prior periods have not been restated 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change  which was immaterial  was reflected in the results of operations in the second quarter of obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include net property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangibles  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying values of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period

individual components of financial results are discussed below 
revenues percent percent change change in thousands consolidated revenues revenues of million for the year ended december  exceeded revenues of million in by 
revenues increased primarily due to a increase in proppant sales volume 
worldwide proppant sales volume increased for the sixth consecutive year to billion pounds and exceeded the sales record of million pounds by 
north american sales volume increased over  driven by the continued strength in the us market and the introduction of carbohydroprop tm in early increases in sales volume in canada of were partially offset by a decrease in mexico 
overseas sales volume increased led by a increase in russia  which is due to the start up of a manufacturing plant in that market during the second quarter of this increase was offset by the impact of other overseas sales which declined in compared to the average selling price per pound of ceramic proppant was per pound in compared to per pound in revenues of million for the year ended december  surpassed the prior year record of million by

fixed manufacturing costs include depreciation  property taxes on production facilities  insurance and factory overhead 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for the increase in gross profit was the result of increased revenues driven primarily by higher sales volumes 
despite the revenue and gross profit growth  gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined primarily as a result of lower margin sales in russia  sales of lower margin carbohydroprop tm  higher manufacturing costs in the company s us plants primarily resulting from increases in the cost of natural gas and raw materials  and increased freight to transport products to customer locations 
although gross profit margins as a percentage of revenues has declined in recent years  the company believes recent price increases in proppant products may favorably impact the gross profit percentage 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  for gross profit decreased million despite an increase of million in revenue 
the factors contributing to the decrease in the proppant gross profit from to are increased manufacturing and freight costs associated with the production and sale of high strength proppants  high production costs during the start up of the company s manufacturing facility in russia  increased field trial activity in which the company sells its products at a discounted price  and increased pricing pressure in certain international markets 
these increased costs were partially offset by a reduction in natural gas costs in the company s us manufacturing facilities

table of contents other income for the year ended december  declined million compared to primarily due to a million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains resulting from exchange rate fluctuations between the local reporting currency and the currency in which certain liabilities of the company s subsidiary in russia are denominated 
the company recognizes gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in these currencies as a result of the capital structure of its investment in that country 
by the end of  the company had restructured its investment in russia thereby limiting income statement exposure to future changes in currency exchange rates 
this reduction in foreign currency gains was partially offset by a million increase in gains resulting from changes in exchange rates between the functional currency and the foreign currency in which the effective transactions were denominated 
other income for the year ended december  increased million compared to this increase is mainly attributed to a million increase in foreign currency exchange gains due to exchange rate fluctuations between the local reporting currency and the currency in which certain liabilities of the company s subsidiary in russia are denominated  partially offset by a decrease in interest income attributed to lower cash balances as a result of capital spending to add proppant manufacturing capacity

the company believes its results will be influenced by the level of natural gas drilling in north america but expects its ability to demonstrate the value of ceramic proppant relative to alternatives will allow it to continue to generate new sales opportunities 
the company believes its introduction of carbohydroprop tm should further the penetration of the market for sand based proppant in slickwater fracturing treatments 
given the levels of natural gas inventories in north america and the limited levels of availability in the current credit market  the company believes the recent contraction in drilling activity is likely to persist  but also expects that the steep decline curves in the resource plays providing much of the incremental natural gas supply in north america will help in bringing supply and demand more into balance as the rig activity continues to decline 
however  the company is unable to determine how detrimental of an effect the us economic crisis will have on overall natural gas demand 
subject to its financial condition  the amount of funds generated from operations and the level of capital expenditures  the company s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends to holders of its common stock 
on january   the company s board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of per share to shareholders of the company s common stock on february  the company estimates its total capital expenditures in will be between million and million 
the company maintains an unsecured line of credit of million 
as of december   there was no outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
the company anticipates that cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses  tax obligations  capital expenditures and other cash needs for the next months 
the company also believes that it could acquire additional debt financing  if needed 
based on these assumptions  the company believes that its fixed costs could be met even with a moderate decrease in demand for the company s products

each of the contracts is described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
four of the contracts do not require the company to purchase minimum annual quantities  but do require the purchase of minimum annual percentages  ranging from to of the respective plants requirements for the specified raw materials 
one outstanding contract requires the company to purchase a minimum annual quantity of material  which is included in the above table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact its investments in china and russia 
as of december   the company s net investment that is subject to foreign currency fluctuations totaled million  and the company has recorded a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of million  net of deferred income tax benefit 
this cumulative translation loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
also  the company s subsidiary in russia has borrowed funds from another subsidiary of the company to fund construction of a manufacturing plant in russia 
this indebtedness  while eliminated in consolidation of the financial statements  is subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the local reporting currency and the currency in which the debt is denominated 
currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with this indebtedness result in gains and losses that impact net income 
the gains and losses are presented in other income expense 
amounts outstanding under the loan totaled million as of december  but had been reduced to million as of december  and further reduced to million in january when necessary  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
there were no such foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company has a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  the company may elect to pay interest at either a fluctuating base rate established by the bank from time to time or at a rate based on the rate established in the london inter bank market 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  the company does not believe that it has any material exposure to market risk associated with interest rates
