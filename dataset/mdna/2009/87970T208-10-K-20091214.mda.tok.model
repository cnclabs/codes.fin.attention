item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction telular designs  develops and distributes products and services that utilize wireless networks to provide data and voice connectivity among people and machines 
telular s product and service offerings combine the company s historical competency in developing cellular networking electronics with the data transport capabilities of commercial wireless networks in order to create information networking solutions 
the company generates most of its revenue by designing  producing and selling products and through the delivery of mm and event monitoring services  such as its telguard and tanklink services 
although the company has a wide base of customers in the western hemisphere  much of its revenue is generated from a small number of major customers 
the company s operating expense levels are based in large part on its expectations for its future revenues 
if anticipated sales in any quarter do not occur as expected  expenditure and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  could be adversely affected 
certain factors that could significantly impact expected results are described in item a  risk factors 
the market for the company s products is primarily in north and south america and consists of a number of vertical applications including telguard security alarm conveyance  tanklink storage tank monitoring  and  general purpose wireless terminals for voice calls and internet access 
these markets are addressed primarily through indirect channels consisting of third party vars  distributors  representatives and agents along with in house sales and customer support teams 
a direct sales model is utilized for certain large customers 
during june  telular abandoned its fixed cellular phone fcp segment after unsuccessfully marketing this unit for sale 
many of the segment s assets were parts and finished goods inventory which were sold prior to abandonment of the segment on june  the company believes that its future success depends on its ability to continue to meet customers needs through product innovation  including the creation of event monitoring services that can be sold with products 
research and development activities sponsored by the company for the years ended september   and were   and  respectively 
the following details areas of product delivery and research during fiscal and anticipated in fiscal telguard telular s engineering team continues to update the telguard digital product portfolio by addressing the growing demand and technology changes in the electronics security market 
in fiscal  telular enhanced the functionality of its tg product and undertook a redesign of certain other telguard hardware devices 
the launch of these redesigned products is expected to occur in fiscal and will improve the company s ability to profitably serve the security markets 
in addition  telular is designing a new hardware product for security dealers that it plans to release in fiscal tanklink the fiscal acquisition of tanklink brought the company a successful wireless communicator product line for tank level monitoring 
enhancements to this hardware and its supporting message center have been made during telular plans to further enhance this product line during fiscal to support a wider array of sensors and to add additional features to the hardware products which enable the service offering 
other mm solutions during  telular evaluated a number of vertical and sub vertical mm markets to determine the viability of creating or acquiring a product and or service for these markets 
while the company did not develop any such solutions  it will continue to examine growth possibilities and new solutions in the mm market space 
fabrication of telular s products is accomplished through contract manufacturing 
contract manufacturers in china and the united states make and test all hardware products 
there are several firms that compete with the company s telguard products and services 
these primary competitors include honeywell  dsc  numerex and alarm 
com 
telular believes it has a significant portion of the market share for cellular alarm communicators  having introduced the first such device for digital cellular networks in march demand for cellular communicators has increased markedly over the past year 
we believe this is due to consumers eliminating traditional telephone lines and therefore  requiring a cellular communicator to enable a home security system 
if this trend continues  the company believes that telular and its competitors will continue to see substantial demand for products and related services 
with regard to the other terminal products sold by telular  there are a large number of competitors that manufacture and sell fcts 
they include ericsson  axesstel  yx and numerous other manufacturers in asia and elsewhere 
much of the demand for these terminals is outside the united states and demand is concentrated among the large wireless carriers that operate in various countries around the world 
competition is based on reputation  features and pricing 
telular s products have historically sold well in latin america and the company is able to realize an acceptable selling price due to telular s reputation for quality products in that region 
the fct business is not a primary focus of telular but it continues to earn an acceptable contribution margin and will be maintained for as long as it continues to do so 
telular has granted a license for its patents to ericsson radio systems ab and currently faces competition for fct sales from ericsson 
with respect to its interface technology  the company currently has issued patents and issued foreign patents 
the company has successfully defended some of its patents in court 
outlook the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
the company expects to expend most of its market and product development resources on the mm space  including continuing to capitalize on its favorable market position in the domestic security alarm market by virtue of its well regarded telguard offering 
due to uncertainties in international markets and pending new product introductions  the company is unable to forecast results and resource allocations for fct products 
the amount and frequency of product shipments to the company s largest customers depends on many factors  including market conditions and agreements with other suppliers 
the outcome of pending and future negotiations for orders with such customers and the timing of shipments may have a significant impact on the company s future revenues and profitability 
results of operations in thousands  except share data fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues and costs of sales change amount percentage net product sales monitoring equipment terminal total product revenues service revenues total revenues cost of sales products services gross margin revenues product revenues decreased primarily due to decreased sales of both telguard monitoring equipment and terminal products as a result of lower customer demand 
demand for our telguard products during fiscal was heightened by an fcc mandated transition from analog to digital cellular service in the first and second quarters of fiscal sales of our terminals products were primarily lower in the central american latin american cala region due to depressed economies resulting in decreased purchases 
services revenues increased  primarily due to continued increase of subscribers including tank subscribers not included in fiscal results 
as of september   the subscriber base is approximately  an increase of approximately  subscribers from approximately  subscribers as of september  cost of sales the decrease in total cost of sales of reflects both lower sales volume and product mix 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for the last year 
product margins  as a percentage of product revenues  decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease was a result of reduced product pricing due to competitive pressures 
service margins  as a percentage of service revenues  increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a reduction in fulfillment costs that were partially offset by a slight increase in carrier surcharge costs 
operating expenses change of revenues amount percentage engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative engineering and development engineering and development expenses decreased by primarily due to reductions of in professional fees primarily due to placement fees incurred in fiscal to replace voluntary employee terminations as a result of the move of the engineering and development function to atlanta from new york  in engineering materials and supplies  as a result of efforts to hold costs down  in travel expenses which reflects the move of the engineering and development function to atlanta from new york in these expense reductions were offset by a increase in facility and office expenses related to the acquisition of tanklink 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased by primarily due to reductions of expenses specifically related to decreased levels of product sales of third party commission expenses  of co op marketing expenses  and  of internal commissions 
in consulting fees as a result of hiring additional permanent marketing and sales staff  reducing the use of consultants 
offsetting these expense reductions was a  increase in payroll related expenses as a result of the addition of sales and marketing staff and the addition of staff from the acquisition of tanklink as well as a increase in travel expenses 
general and administrative g a g a costs for fiscal have been reclassified to include general business taxes which were previously included in other income 
this is consistent with fiscal s presentation 
g a expenses decreased by  primarily due to reductions of in professional fees related to decreased legal fees as a result of reduced costs from outside counsel  decreased accounting fees resulting from factors impacting the cost of our external audit and decreased consulting fees as a result of not renewing strategic projects undertaken in fiscal  in payroll related fees such as reduced bonuses and non cash compensation related to issued stock options and stock option modifications  of expenses as a result of the reduction of amortization expense related to a prepaid loan fee and reduced commercial insurance  of travel expenses as a result of efforts to control costs  of facility  office and general expenses 
offsetting these reductions is an increase of for intangible amortization related to the acquisition of tanklink and of additional proxy costs related to the proxy contest in fiscal other income other income decreased by primarily from a reduction of interest income as a result of reduced rates and a reduced investment balance  and a increase of in various miscellaneous expenses 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of for fiscal related to alternative minimum taxes 
there was no income tax provision for discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations of was due primarily to the return of phones previously sold to a customer in prior periods and the resale of those phones at a loss 
the company decided to take back the product in lieu of further attempts to collect on the outstanding account receivable from the prior period sale 
the resulting account receivable from the resale was fully collected as of september  net income the company recorded net income of  or per fully diluted share for fiscal compared to a net loss of  of 
per fully diluted share for fiscal this increase was primarily due to reduced product costs and reduced operating costs 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues and costs of sales change amount percentage net product sales telguard terminal total product revenues service revenues total revenues cost of sales products services gross margin revenues total product revenues decreased in fiscal due to decreased sales of our telguard products 
our dealers and distributors increased their inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal year anticipating a stronger demand to convert from analog to digital 
as that demand waned and the housing market continued to weaken  our customers reduced their purchases during the last half of fiscal terminal product sales increased primarily due to sales increases in the domestic market 
the increase in service revenues is a result of the increase in the activation of monitoring services related to additional telguard unit sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first six months of fiscal activations  which are dependent on telguard unit installations  will lag behind the sales of those units 
cost of sales total cost of sales decreased in fiscal this was due to both a decrease in the volume of sales and decreased cost of manufacturing products and delivering services 
product cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal this decrease was attributed to decreased manufacturing costs 
service cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this was primarily due to the lower cost of providing digital services as a result of the transition from analog services 
operating expenses change of revenues amount percentage engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative engineering and development the decrease of  in engineering and development costs was primarily due to reductions of  in payroll related expenses as a result of elimination of one time expenses in fiscal related to costs associated with w reduction on workforce of and savings from reduced engineering staff of  in facility costs as a result of moving the engineering function from new york to atlanta  in prototype and supplies costs 
offsetting these reductions was an increase of in recruiting cost to replace engineers who did not move to atlanta 
selling and marketing selling and marketing costs increased primarily due to increases of in payroll related expenses from increased staff in marketing  sales and product support  in facility costs as a result of moving to a new location in atlanta  in targeted co op marketing expenses related to the telguard products 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in external commissions related to reduced sales volumes 
general and administrative g a g a costs for fiscal and have been restated to include general business taxes which were previously included in other income 
this is consistent with fiscal s presentation 
g a costs increased  in fiscal primarily due to increases of in legal and professional fees  in payroll related costs as a result of severance paid to terminated officers and non cash compensation related to stock option modifications in bank fees and insurance costs 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in facility costs as a result of moving the corporate headquarters to chicago 
other income other income for fiscal increased by compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a increase in interest income as a result of increased cash balances throughout the year  a decrease in interest expense of as a result of reducing the company s borrowings to and a increase in various other miscellaneous expense items during the year 
income taxes the company recorded no income tax benefit for both fiscal years and due to the uncertainty of the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
discontinued operations the loss from discontinued operations of  for the fiscal decreased from a loss of  for fiscal sales decreased significantly as the company exited the fcp market and sold its remaining inventory 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined that it would be unable to find a buyer for the fcp business unit 
as a result  the company made a strategic decision to abandon the fcp business unit effective june  the majority of the assets of the business have been disposed of 
the remaining assets as of september  consist of trade accounts receivable of  inventory held for warranty purposes  which has been fully reserved for  and of test equipment which the company intends to sell at auction 
the following table summarizes the activity of the discontinued operations for the fiscal years and also  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
change percentage revenues cost of sales gross margin engineering and development selling and marketing amortization impairment loss loss on asset disposals other net loss the company recorded a net loss of  or per share for fiscal compared to a net loss of  or per share for fiscal the decrease in net loss was primarily due to the result of increased margins due to improved product mix and a reduction of manufacturing cost and containment of operational costs 
liquidity and capital resources management regularly reviews the company s working capital and available borrowings in addition to its cash and cash equivalent balance to determine if it has enough cash to operate the business 
on september   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and net working capital of  a year earlier 
the company can draw upon a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank svb that provides an aggregate working capital line of credit up to  management expects trade accounts receivable and inventory to turn into cash in short periods of time 
as such  given the level of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable and inventory  management believes the company has adequate resources to fund current and planned operations in a consistent manner with historical practices 
the tables below discuss the liquidity components of continuing operations for fiscal years and fiscal the company generated cash of  from continuing operations during fiscal compared to cash generated of  during the same period of fiscal the components of the change for fiscal are as follows income from continuing operations  cash provided 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable is due to the timely collection of outstanding balances  resulting from a more favorable product mix 
service revenue represents of telular s total revenues for the twelve month period ending september  the accounts receivable associated with this revenue stream are generally collected within days of invoicing 
the timely collections along with reduced product billings resulted in the decrease 
the decrease in inventory reflects the company s overall inventory strategy  sell from exiting stock while reducing production levels to augment the reduction in sales levels 
trade accounts payable primarily consists of amounts due to telular s contract manufacturers 
the decrease reflects decreased purchases from our contract manufactures  primariily due to reduced sales volume 
the decrease in accrued liabilities was primarily due to payments for bonuses  royalties and co op advertising and the reduction in liability balances related to reduced sales volumes such as agent commissions  professional fees and certain operating expenses 
non cash expenses  from stock based compensation  depreciation expense  amortization expense 
net cash provided by other working capital items 
total cash provided by continuing operations fiscal the company generated cash of  from continuing operations during fiscal year compared to cash generated of  during the same period of fiscal the components of the change for fiscal are as follows income from continuing operations  cash provided 
non cash expenses  from stock based compensation  depreciation expenses  loss on disposal of fixed assets 
the decrease in trade accounts receivable is due primarily to the collection during the period of balances outstanding balances at september  and timely customer payments on sales made during the nine month period 
the increase in inventory reflects the buildup of telguard and terminal inventory to a level the company feels is modestly above normal 
inventory levels decreased substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the large sale of telguard units to customers who were anticipating the conversion of cellular networks to digital from analog 
trade accounts payable primarily consists of amounts due to telular s contract manufacturers 
to assure timely production of inventory to meet customers needs  these accounts are kept current 
that process  in addition to the payments made to our contract manufacturers in the first quarter of fiscal for the production to support the increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  led to the reduction in trade accounts payable 
net cash used in other working capital items primarily due to a increase in notes receivable related to a temporary cash advance to related party 
the note receivable has been repaid in october see subsequent events footnote in
