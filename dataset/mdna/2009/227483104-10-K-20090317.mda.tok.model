the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  risk factors  forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are a diversified leader in healthcare staffing services 
we offer a comprehensive suite of staffing and outsourcing services to the healthcare market  which together include being a leading provider of nurse and allied staffing services in the united states  a national provider of multi specialty locum tenens temporary physician staffing services  a provider of clinical trials services to global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers  and a provider of other human capital management services focused on healthcare 
we have a diversified revenue mix across business sectors and healthcare customers 
for the quarter ended december   our nurse and allied staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and is comprised of travel and per diem nurse staffing and travel allied health staffing 
travel nurse staffing represented approximately of our total revenue and of our nurse and allied staffing business segment revenue 
other nurse and allied staffing services include the placement of per diem nurses and allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists 
our physician staffing business segment represented approximately of fourth quarter revenue and consists of temporary physician staffing services locum tenens 
our clinical trials services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of service offerings that include tradition al staffing  as well as clinical trials management  drug safety monitoring and regulatory services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers 
our other human capital management services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of education and training and retained search services 
for the year ended december   our revenue was million  and we had a net loss of million  or per diluted share 
the net loss was a result of recording million million after taxes in impairment charges  a separate line item on our consolidated statement of operations  in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to our annual goodwill impairment testing 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and we ended the year with total debt of million and million of unrestricted cash  resulting in a ratio of debt  net of unrestricted cash  to total capitalization of as of december  in general  we evaluate the company s financial condition and operating results by revenue  contribution income see segment information  and net loss income 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
in addition  we monitor several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  number of ftes and price 
nurse and allied staffing our nurse and allied staffing services business segment is headquartered in boca raton  florida 
our travel staffing business is operated from a relatively centralized business model servicing all of the assignments needs of our field employees and client facilities through operation centers located in boca raton  florida  malden  massachusetts  newtown square  pennsylvania  tampa  florida  and norcross  georgia 
our per diem staffing operations are provided through a network of brand offices serving major metropolitan markets predominantly located on the east and west coasts of the us our nurse and allied staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of nurses and demand for our staffing services at healthcare facilities 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare professionals who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals could limit our ability to fill open orders and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment 
we also believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in the long term by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses 
cross country staffing is our core staffing brand that markets its staffing services to hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the us as well as operates differentiated recruiting brands to recruit registered nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
as a part of its business strategy  cross country staffing is pursuing and implementing exclusive and preferred provider relationships with hospital clients and group purchasing organizations 
cross country staffing provides clients with a suite of solutions to facilitate the efficient management of their temporary workforce while decreasing overall operating costs 
these range from efficiency enhancing technology to full vendor management solutions 
we operate differentiated nurse and allied recruiting brands including cross country travcorps  medstaff  novapro  cross country local  allied health group and assignment america to recruit nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
we believe that these professionals are attracted to us because we offer a wide range of diverse assignments at attractive locations  competitive compensation and benefit packages  as well as high levels of customer service 
typically  as admissions increase for our hospital customers  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as admissions decline  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their staff employees 
the current environment for our nurse and allied staffing services reflects both hospital admission trends that have been flat to down since the first quarter of and a deteriorating national labor market resulting in higher levels of unemployment that translates into more uninsured people and fewer people with commercial health insurance coverage 
in a difficult operating environment  during the fourth quarter of  demand for our travel nurse staffing services  as expressed by the number of orders from our hospital and healthcare facility customers  declined approximately from the prior year while our staffing volume decreased year over year 
however  we were able to improve our margins through continued expansion of the bill pay spread and a moderation of housing expenses 
bill rates  as measured by revenue per hour in our travel nurse staffing business  continued to rise in the low single digit range consistent with our experience over the past several years 
in addition  we experienced a decrease in booking activity from our clients for future assignments 
our hospital clients have been increasingly reluctant to commit to a contract nurse  most often citing low patient census and budget reductions as factors for their hesitation 
on the supply side  we believe a nurse s willingness to leave a full time hospital staff position is affected by the overall economic environment and its potential impact on the employment security and income earnings potential of the nurse s spouse 
we believe that recent weakness in the nation s employment statistics is likely having an adverse effect on the willingness of nurses to relinquish the security of a full time hospital staff p osition in order to take a travel assignment with us 
due to these economic and market factors  there is the potential for the business environment for nurse and allied staffing to weaken further during physician staffing we added the physician staffing business segment in with the acquisition of mda holdings  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  mda as described in the acquisitions section which follows 
mda is headquartered in norcross  georgia 
our physician staffing business segment provides multi specialty locum tenens temporary physician staffing and allied staffing services to the healthcare industry in all states 
clinical trials services our clinical trials services business segment is headquartered at the research triangle park rtp in durham  north carolina 
we provide a flexible range of traditional contract staffing  clinical research outsourcing  drug safety monitoring  and regulatory consulting services to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  as well as contract research organization cro customers 
we market these services through multiple brand offerings that have allowed us to establish a significant geographic footprint in the us along with an important presence in the european market 
our clinical trials services business has also experienced a reluctance from its clients to commit to project start ups 
certain projects scheduled to start in the fourth quarter were delayed until pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers have become less willing to use temporary staffing and out sourcing services to meet their clinical trials objectives 
we believe this is driven by an effort to reduce expenses at all levels to conserve cash in the current economic environment at all levels 
this includes research efforts  which effectively delays the start of some clinical projects 
however  we believe there are a sufficient number of trials being planned that represent opportunities for this business both on a domestic and international basis 
other human capital management services education and training services our cross country education cce subsidiary  headquartered in brentwood  tennessee  provides continuing education programs to the healthcare industry

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional expenses from the clinical trials services acquisitions  higher compensation expense in our nurse and allied staffing business segment  higher direct mail costs in our education and training business  and higher legal expenses in our retained search business

the credit agreement provides for an amount allowed for stock repurchases dividends 
the limitation increases each year by of net income provided that our debt ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement is less than to and we have million in cash or available cash under the revolving loan facility

we are also required to obtain the consent of the lenders to complete any acquisition which exceeds million excluding the mda acquisition or would cause us to exceed million excluding the mda acquisition in aggregate payments during the term of the agreement 
the commitments under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was million compared to million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  in addition to the above disclosed contractual obligations  the fin tax liability was million at december  based on the uncertainties associated with the settlement of these items  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of potential settlements  if any  with the taxing authorities 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various ass umptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions through december  upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
we completed the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarters of   and based on the results of the tests  we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets relating to continuing operations as of december   and pursuant to the annual testing of goodwill  in the fourth quarter of  we evaluated five reporting units nurse and allied staffing  physician staffing  clinical trials services  retained search and education and training 
as a result of the review  we recorded an impairment charge related to the nurse and allied staffing reporting unit of million  pretax 
the impairment test requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount including goodwill as step one 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units  primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to calculate the implied fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit as determined in step one 
in this step  we must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
this also requires the identificat ion of any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the implied value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount to determine the amount of any impairment charge 
in addition  fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to test the recoverability of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in testing for potential impairment under fasb statement no 
 if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows  we must then determine the amount by which the fair value of those assets exceeds the carrying value and determine the amount of impairment  if any 
based on our fasb statement no 
impairment analysis  we concluded that the carrying value of a particular customer relationship in the clinical trials services business segment was higher than its respective estimated fair value and recorded a million impairment charge  pretax 
total impairment charges resulting from the fasb statement no 
and reviews in the fourth quarter of was million and is included as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions that required significant judgments  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
specifically  further deterioration of demand for our services  further deterioration of labor market conditions  reduction of our stock price for an extended period  or other factors as described in item a risk factors  may affect our determination of fair value of each reporting unit 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued compensation and benefits on our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial models  as well as industry experience and trends 
if such models indicate that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment as well as actual company experience and increases in national healthcare costs 
as of december  and  we had million and millio n accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
corporate and field employees are covered through a partially self insured health plan 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of the incurred but not reported health insurance claims accrual related to corporate employees 
workers compensation insurance accruals can fluctuate over time due to the number of employees and inflation  as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims and retentions  net of related insurance recoveries receivable  a decrease of million over the amount accrued at december  the accrual for workers compensation is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
as of december   and  we had million and n bsp  million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported professional liability claims and retentions  net of related insurance recoveries receivable 
the increased accrual is entirely due to the acquisition of mda 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an actuarial model which is prepared or reviewed by an independent actuary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write off specific accounts based on an ongoing review of collectibility as well as our past experience with the customer 
historically  losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against us  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business are described in legal proceedings 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
as of december  and  we have deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards for which we have recorded a valuation allowance 
in addition  the tax effect resulting from our goodwill impairment charge recorded in the year ended december   caused the net deferred tax liability position as of december nbs p   to change to a net deferred tax asset position 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset related to the goodwill impairment charge will be realized in the future with the exception of a specific state portion of the net deferred tax asset for which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
in considering whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate we consider several sources of taxable income  including  but not limited to the following items the reversal of taxable temporary differences to offset deductible temporary differences in the future 
carryback potential to support the utilization of the deferred tax asset 
projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards 
in our determination at december   we relied partially on projections of future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  to reach our conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary on the net deferred tax asset  except as otherwise discussed 
however  if the levels of future taxable income we have projected are not achieved  there is a risk that the company could not recover this entire net deferred tax asset 
we will continue  in the future  to evaluate whether or not the net deferred tax assets will be fully realized prior to expiration 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
an unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the current portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a component of the income taxes receivable account  and the non current port ion is included within other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items  if applicable  which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent of fasb staff position no 
is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fasb statement no 
r and other us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
fasb staff position no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is prohibited 
we will implement fasb staff position no 
on ja nuary  we expect that fasb staff position no 
could have an impact on our future consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
in february  the fasb staff position no 
was issued  which delays the effective date for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities included in fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the effective date has been deferred to fiscal years beginning after november  for these nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we do not expect the deferred portion of the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb no 
r  business combinations fasb r  which replaces fasb fasb r applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses and requires that all assets and liabilities of an acquired business as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree be recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date 
among other things  fasb r requires the expensing of direct transaction costs  including deal costs and restructuring costs as incurred 
in addition  contingent consideration arrangements will be recognized at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings 
pre acquisition contingencies will also typically be recognized at their acquisition date fair values 
in subsequent periods  contingent liabilities will be measured at the higher of their acquisition date fair values or the estimated amounts to be realized 
in addition  material adjustments made to the initial acquisition purchase accounting will be required to be recorded back to the acquisition date 
this will cause companies to revise previously reported results when reporting comparative financial information in subsequent filings 
fasb r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we expect that fasb r could have an impact on our future consolidated financial statements  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
seasonality the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment with us is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations which may impact our quarterly revenue and earnings 
hospital patient census and staffing needs of our hospital and healthcare facilities fluctuate which impact our number of orders for a particular period 
many of our hospital and healthcare facility clients are located in areas that experience seasonal fluctuations in population during the winter and summer months 
these facilities adjust their staffing levels to accommodate the change in this seasonal demand and many of these facilities utilize temporary healthcare professionals to satisfy these seasonal staffing needs 
likewise  the number of nurse and allied professionals on assignment may fluctuate due to the seasonal preferences for destinations of our temporary nurse and allied professionals 
in addition  we expect our physician staffing business to experience higher demand in the summer mont hs as physicians take vacations 
this historical seasonality of revenue and earnings may vary due to a variety of factors and the results of any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of professional  general and healthcare insurance 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our revolving loan and term loans under our credit agreement  which bears interest based on floating rates 
refer to liquidity and capital resources credit agreement included in item management s discussion and analysis above for further discussion about our credit agreement and related interest rate swaps 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in  million in and million in we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
our international operations generated less than of our consolidated revenue during the years ending december  and  and were primarily from the united kingdom 
we have not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
our international operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of our non us markets  our reported results vary 
fluctuations in exchange rates also impact the us dollar amount of stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  included in other stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet
