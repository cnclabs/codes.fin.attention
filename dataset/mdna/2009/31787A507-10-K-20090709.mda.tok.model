industry background and markets optical subsystems and components industry background computer networks are frequently described in terms of the distance they span and by the hardware and software protocols used to transport and store data 
the physical medium through which signals are best transmitted over these networks depends on the amount of data or bandwidth to be transmitted  expressed as gigabits per second  or gbps  and the distance involved 
voice grade copper wire can only support connections of about miles without the use of repeaters to amplify the signal  whereas optical systems can carry signals in excess of miles without further processing 
early computer networks had relatively limited performance requirements  short connection distances and low transmission speeds and  therefore  relied almost exclusively on copper wire as the medium of choice 
at speeds of more than gbps  the ability of copper wire to transmit more than meters is limited due to the loss of signal over distance as well as interference from external signal generating equipment 
the proliferation of electronic commerce  communications and broadband entertainment has resulted in the digitization and accumulation of enormous amounts of data 
thus  while copper continues to be the primary medium used for delivering signals to the desktop  even at gbps  the need to quickly transmit  store and retrieve large blocks of data across networks in a cost effective manner has increasingly required enterprises and service providers to use fiber optic technology to transmit data at higher speeds over greater distances and to expand the capacity  or bandwidth  of their networks 
a lan typically consists of a group of computers and other devices that share the resources of one or more processors or servers within a small geographic area and are connected through the use of hubs used for broadcasting data within a lan  switches used for sending data to a specific destination in a lan and routers used as gateways to route data packets between two or more lans or other large networks 
in order to switch or route optical signals to their ultimate destination  they must first be converted to electrical signals which can be processed by the switch  router or other networking equipment and then retransmitted as optical signals to the next switching point or ending destination 
as a result  data networking equipment typically contains multiple connection points  or ports  in which various types of transceivers or transponders are used to transmit and receive signals to and from other networking equipment over various distances using a variety of networking protocols 
lans typically use the ethernet protocol to transport data packets across the network at distances of up to meters at speeds of to gbps 
because most residential and business subscriber traffic begins and ends over ethernet  it has become the de facto standard user interface for connecting to the public network 
and  while ethernet was originally developed as a data oriented protocol  it has evolved to support a wide range of services including digital voice and video as well as data 
in response to continually increasing bandwidth and performance requirements  the gigabit ethernet standard  which allows lans to operate at gbps  was introduced in a gbps version of ethernet  or gige  was introduced in we expect that pre standard products capable of 
table of contents transmitting at to gbps for ethernet applications will reach the market in late  including gbps products used for server connectivity and gbps products for core switching applications 
standards compliant versions of these products are expected to become available following the expected june ratification of the ba standard 
a san is a high speed subnetwork embedded within a lan where critical data stored on devices such as disk arrays  optical disks and tape backup devices is made available to all servers on the lan thereby freeing the network servers to deliver business applications  increasing network capacity and improving response time 
sans were originally developed using the fibre channel protocol designed for storing and retrieving large blocks of data 
a san based on the fibre channel protocol typically incorporates the use of file servers containing host bus adapters  or hbas  for accessing multiple storage devices through one or more switches  thereby creating multiple paths to that storage 
the fibre channel interconnect protocol  operating at gbps  was introduced in to address the speed  distance and connectivity limitations of copper based storage solutions using the small computer interface  or scsi  interface protocol while maintaining backward compatibility with the installed base of scsi based storage systems 
products for the fibre channel protocol capable of transmitting at data rates of  and gbps are now being delivered and products capable of gbps are currently in development 
a number of new storage technologies have been introduced to lower the cost and complexity of deploying fibre channel based storage networks 
since its introduction in  small and medium size storage networks have been developed based on the internet small computer system interface protocol  or iscsi 
other solutions designed to reduce the cost of storage networks allow for the direct attachment of storage systems to the network without requiring a host  also known as network attached storage  or nas 
in  the fibre channel over ethernet standard  or fcoe  was introduced which enables fibre channel data packets to be encapsulated within enhanced ethernet frames 
this standard utilizes the additional bandwidth created at transmission speeds of gbps and higher to combine different types of data traffic for storage fibre channel  lan traffic tcp ip and various server clustering protocols infiniband that previously required their own separate infrastructure within a data center 
as a result  fcoe will enable the creation of a single converged network within a data center  rather than two or three networks as previously required 
since a single server will be able to use a single network interface card to accommodate the various types of traffic in fcoe based networks  the number of cables and connections in such a network can be reduced with fewer  but higher speed connections 
in addition  the fcoe protocol will be able to utilize ethernet based technology currently under development for transmitting signals at speeds of and gbps 
due to the cost effectiveness of the optical technologies involved  transceivers for both lans and sans have been developed using vertical cavity surface emitting lasers  or vcsels  to transmit and receive signals at the nanometer  or nm  wavelength over relatively short distances through multi mode fiber 
most lans and sans operating today at   and gbps over distances of up to meters  incorporate this vcsel technology 
the same technology is now being employed to build fcoe and iscsi based lans and sans operating at gbps 
a new market has emerged in recent years for the use of parallel optics technologies for high capacity interconnects used in telecommunications applications to connect core ip routers and in the datacenter to interconnect sans and servers and for high performance computing clusters 
this technology makes use of an array of lasers and photodetectors instead of using just one per transceiver to boost the amount of data that can be transmitted over a single fiber over very short distances 
optical interconnects provide for an attractive alternative to bulky copper cables as data rate and port densities increase allowing for fewer connections 
like the transceivers used for lans and sans  parallel optical solutions rely primarily on the use of vcsel technology 
a variation of parallel optics technology called active optical cable  or aoc  was introduced by several vendors in late these products eliminate the use of fiber connectors used in other parallel optical modules by bonding the fibers directly to the optical subassembly 
according to industry analyst lightcounting  demand for aocs is expected to equal or exceed demand for other parallel optical solutions by a man is a regional data network typically covering an area of up to kilometers in diameter that allows the sharing of computing resources on a regional basis within a town or city 
these metro networks are typically arranged in a ring configuration that can ultimately transmit data around metropolitan areas over hundreds of kilometers 
mans typically use the sonet and sdh communications standards to encapsulate data to be 
table of contents transmitted over fiber optic cable due to the widespread use of this standard in legacy telecommunication networks 
however  mans can also be built using the ethernet standard  also known as metro ethernet  which can typically result in savings to the network operator in terms of network infrastructure and operating costs 
the portion of a man that connects a lan or san to a public data network is frequently referred to as the last mile or access portion of a network 
there are several means that carriers employ to provide integrated voice  video and data services to customers over this portion of the network 
the more popular means include catv and passive optical networks  or pons 
both pons and catv employ the use of fiber optic technologies in providing these services 
a pon is a point to multipoint  fiber to the premises network architecture in which unpowered optical splitters are used to enable a single optical fiber to serve multiple premises  typically a pon consists of an optical line terminal  or olt  at the service provider s central office and a number of optical network units  or onus  near end users 
a pon configuration reduces the amount of fiber and central office equipment required compared with point to point architectures 
today  there are three standardized versions of pon based on network speeds broadband pon  or bpon  operating at 
gbps  ethernet pon  or epon  operating at gbps and gigabit pon  or gpon  operating at gbps 
while epon products currently dominate the market due to their early adoption in japan and south korea  according to lightcounting  the demand for gpon products will surpass all other types by catv is a shared cable system that uses radio frequency  or rf  signals to deliver services over a tree and branch topology in which multiple households within a neighborhood share the same cable 
while early catv systems were all coaxial cable  they have increasingly employed fiber optic cable to overcome attenuation of signals over long distances and problems related to aging components 
fiber also provides more bandwidth for future expansion 
this dual system is called a hybrid fiber coax  or hfc 
due to the shared nature of a catv network and the use of rf signal technology  these networks typically utilize analog lasers in conjunction with optical amplifiers to deliver these services 
transceivers and transponders used in building mans and wans typically require the use of fabry perot  or fp  distributed feedback  or dfb  and externally modulated lasers operating at wavelengths of nm or nm in order to send signals longer distances through single mode fiber 
in addition  to accommodate the need for bandwidth  carriers employ the use of wavelength division multiplexing  or wdm  a technique that combines multiple wavelengths on a single optical fiber 
systems using coarse wavelength multiplexing  or cwdm  typically use only eight wavelengths  spaced nm apart  while systems using dense wavelength division multiplexing  or dwdm  use up to wavelengths 
dwdm systems enable both bandwidth optimization and increased wavelength agility throughout the network 
the groups of wavelengths or channels in a dwdm system are usually defined in terms of frequency of the channel and the channels are generally spaced at either or gigahertz or nm intervals 
initially  dwdm systems utilized a transceiver or transponder for each wavelength as specified by the customer 
however  transponders that are capable of being tuned to transmit and receive specific wavelengths by the customer are increasingly becoming the preferred product solution for these large bandwidth applications  while the same capability is being developed for transceivers in a smaller footprint 
these products greatly reduce the amount of inventory of fixed wavelength transceivers that the carrier would otherwise have to carry 
most tunable transponders being shipped today utilize a tunable laser although alternative technologies are being developed such as the chirp managed laser  or cmltm  which creates tunability via the use of novel filters in conjunction with a standard dfb laser 
a wide area network  or wan  is a geographically dispersed data communications network that typically includes the use of a public shared user network such as the telephone system  although a wan can also be built using leased lines or satellites 
similar to mans  a terrestrial wan uses the sonet sdh communications standard to transmit information over longer distances due to its use in legacy telecommunication networks 
addressable markets according to industry analyst lightcounting inc  total sales of transceiver and transponder products in were estimated to be approximately billion 
this total excludes sales of optical products designed for use in catv networks and roadms 
of this total  approximately million represented sales of transceivers used for 
table of contents lan and san applications incorporating optical technologies to generate and receive signals up to meters  approximately million represented sales of transceivers for longer distance mans using the ethernet and fibre channel protocols  approximately million represented sales of transceivers and transponders used in building mans that are compliant with the sonet sdh protocol  approximately million was related to products used in building fiber to the home curb networks  or fttx  and approximately million was for optical interconnects using parallel optics technologies 
according to lightcounting  the market for transceivers and transponders operating at to gbps represented approximately billion  or  of the total market in of this total market  approximately million was for short distance lan applications  million was for longer distance mans using the ethernet protocol  while million  or two thirds  represented sales of transceivers and transponders for sonet sdh networks 
not all segments of the transceiver and transponder market were addressed by our product offerings throughout fiscal products that address the fttx and parallel optics segments  together totaling approximately million per year  were not introduced until the end of fiscal in addition  products for gbps lan and man applications were not qualified at major customers until the same timeframe 
with these new product introductions and the optium merger  we believe we now address all major segments of the transceiver and transponder market 
according to industry analyst ovum  the market for roadms in was approximately million but represents one of the fastest growing product solutions as a result of the ability of roadms to enable flexible bandwidth management in mans 
this market became addressable as a result of the optium merger 
information pertaining to the size of the market for optical products used in catv networks is limited  but we believe annual sales of these products currently total approximately million 
this market also became addressable as a result of the optium merger 
additional markets exist for optical products designed primarily for longer distance wan applications such as laser and detector modules  dispersion compensators and channel monitors for very long haul transmission 
additional opportunities may exist for the application of our underlying optical technologies to non communications markets 
we may decide to enter one or more of these markets in the future 
our future revenue potential for optical products will ultimately depend on the growth rate of our underlying markets  the extent to which we are able to offer new products  particularly for higher speed applications  which will expand our addressable market  the willingness of customers to devote resources to qualifying these new products  our market share and average selling prices 
demand for optical subsystems and components used in lans and sans the demand for optical subsystems and components used in building lans and sans is driven primarily by spending within the business enterprise to meet the demands for growth in information which must be stored and retrieved in a timely manner and made available to users located within a building or campus 
with the evolution of the internet  the amount of data to be stored has increased to the point where the cost of managing and protecting this data has become the primary cost of a typical information technology department 
according to a report issued by the gartner group in  the amount of controller based disk storage is expected to grow at nearly per year from to this growth is being driven in part by video centric files and data generated by the broadcast  media  entertainment  medical and security industries as well as by the proliferation of video capable mobile computing devices 
while much of this data is transient in nature and does not need to be stored  a growing portion of the total will need to be preserved due to regulatory pressures and the desire to use and protect personal information 
most sans are currently capable of transmitting at and gbps under the fibre channel protocol 
to handle this growth in storage requirements  systems operating at gbps are now being deployed and systems capable of gbps are currently in development 
with the introduction of lower cost gbps transceivers  industry analysts believe that  over time  fcoe based solutions may become more popular than fibre channel sans due to their lower cost and ease of installation and administration 

table of contents because sans enable the sharing of resources thereby reducing the required investment in storage infrastructure  the continued growth in stored data is expected to result in the ongoing centralization of storage and the need to deploy larger sans 
the centralization of storage  in turn  is increasing the demand for higher bandwidth solutions to provide faster  more efficient interconnection of data storage systems with servers and lans as well as the need to connect at higher speeds over longer distances for disaster recovery applications 
the future demand for equipment used to build sans and the optical products to connect them will be influenced by a number of factors including the need to connect increasing numbers of storage devices and servers to a growing number of users  the need to provide switched access to multiple storage systems simultaneously  the increasingly mission critical nature of stored data and the need for rapid access to this data  the increase in bandwidth needed to store and retrieve larger files containing graphics and video content  the expense and complexity associated with managing increasingly large amounts of data storage  the increasing cost of downtime and the growing importance of disaster recovery capabilities  the limitations of copper wiring in terms of speed versus distance  the migration of smaller discrete san islands to single integrated sans  an increase in demand for higher bandwidth solutions as larger sans serve a greater number of users across longer distances  an increase in the number of ip based sans deployed by small and medium sized businesses due to the lower cost and reduced complexity associated with using the iscsi or the emerging fcoe protocol in conjunction with networking equipment capable of operating at gbps  and the growing popularity of blade servers and file virtualization which  while reducing the overall number of servers and ports typically copper based connections  is expected to increase demand for optical ports in the data center  particularly those capable of transmitting and receiving signals at higher speeds 
demand for optical subsystems used in metropolitan area networks the demand for products used to build mans is driven primarily by service providers as they seek to upgrade or build new networks to handle the growth in the bandwidth demands of business and residential users 
these users now have extensive gigabyte per second transmission capacity in their buildings and local networks to connect to the public network 
this has resulted in new choke points in today s network infrastructure in the last mile or local loop for network access and in mans themselves  where islands of data are connected by a copper straw reducing transmission rates to megabits per second or slower over a combination of twisted pair copper wire  t lines  frame relay and wireless links 
these choke points are being eliminated with the deployment of equipment using gigabit ethernet and gige transceivers and transponders 
demand for all of these products is tied closely to the demand for bandwidth 
the cisco visual network index is that company s ongoing effort to forecast the growth and use of ip networking worldwide 
according to this index  the amount of bandwidth usage devoted to transmitting ip traffic will increase by a factor of five from to  approaching exabytes per month in  compared to approximately exabytes per month in the amount of bandwidth to be added during the next several years and the networks to be built or upgraded to accommodate this growth will be influenced by several trends including the rollout of competitive broadband networks by the telephony companies to offer voice  data  and video services to compete with cable networks  and the increased availability of video centric services such as video on demand  video telephony conferencing  video mail and high definition television  or hdtv  where mbps of bandwidth is required as compared to about mbps for standard definition television 

table of contents demand for optical products used in wireless networks wireless networks typically use fiber optic transmission to backhaul wireless traffic to the central office for switching 
according the cisco visual network index  mobile data traffic alone is expected to roughly double each year from through largely as a result of the deployment of mobile network devices which offer enhanced communication services  including the ability to download video files as well as offering voice  data and internet connectivity 
to meet these bandwidth demands  next generation wireless networks  or g  are being deployed which expand the use of fiber optic technologies from backhauling mobile traffic out of base stations to being used in cellular towers to reduce the weight of copper based solutions while expanding their bandwidth capabilities 
network performance test systems industry background customers who use equipment to test the performance of packet based networks such as ethernet lans and fibre channel sans include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who conduct extensive testing in the development of their products to ensure system performance and reliability  and operators of data centers who require their networks to be tested on an ongoing basis to ensure maximum uptime and to optimize performance in order to minimize the investment in expensive upgrades 
manufacturers of equipment for both lans and sans typically focus on the design and development of their own products and turn to specialized independent suppliers for state of the art test equipment in order to accelerate the time required to develop new products 
this test equipment consists of protocol analyzers  traffic generators  bit error rate testers and load testers  for ethernet as well as a wide array of storage related protocols including fibre channel  iscsi  sas sata  pci express  and the emerging fiber channel over ethernet protocol  or fcoe 
business strategy we have become a leading supplier of optical products to manufacturers of lan and san networking equipment due in part to our early work in the development of the fibre channel standard in the mid s as well as our pioneering work in developing transceivers using vcsel technology 
as part of our business strategy  we continue to actively serve on various standards committees in helping to influence the use of new cost effective optical technologies 
during the late s through  demand for storage and networking equipment and the optical components and subsystems that connect them was driven by new applications for the internet economy  and the storage and networking capacity that was built was far in excess of end user demand 
with the resulting inventory correction in  we identified several important trends that we believed would have a significant influence on how the optical subsystems and components industry would evolve in the future 
among these trends were industry consolidation involving the combination of key competitors  a reduction in the number of suppliers of optical subsystems to large customers as these customers sought to ensure the financial health of their supply chain  a preference by large oems to use suppliers who are able to offer a broad product line  the need for telecom carriers to enhance their legacy networks in order to compete more effectively with catv networks who were going to bundle their voice  data and video services  the expanded use of pluggable transceivers by telecom carriers in building out these networks over time  ongoing pricing pressures which would require lower costs of production  and a tighter supply chain as a result of the increasing use of customer and supplier inventory hubs which are intended to minimize future inventory corrections  but which also require suppliers to be able to respond more quickly to greater than expected demand 

table of contents to address these trends  we made a number of important strategic decisions in order to develop a vertically integrated business model to achieve lower costs of production and to broaden our product portfolio to enhance our competitive position 
among these decisions were the following may we acquired a former disk drive facility in ipoh  malaysia and developed an optical transceiver manufacturing capability in order to provide low cost  off shore production and to improve our ability to respond quickly to increased demand from customers  march we acquired genoa corporation in fremont  california along with its state of the art wafer fabrication facility in order to develop an internal source of long wavelength lasers both fabry perot and dfb type and achieve lower production costs for transceivers used in man applications  april we acquired a division of honeywell inc engaged in the manufacture of vcsels to gain access to an internal source of short wavelength lasers to achieve lower production costs for transceivers used in lan and san applications  fiscal we invested in critical technologies  including an internal integrated circuit design capability  and a broader product portfolio  january we acquired certain assets of the fiber optics division of infineon technologies ag to gain access to new customers and broaden our product portfolio  particularly for gige applications  november we acquired certain assets of big bear networks  inc related to gige and gbps applications  fiscal we acquired azna  llc and kodeos communications  inc to add critical technologies to cost effectively extend the transmission distance of gbps products and to broaden our product portfolio for gbps applications based on the pin form factor used in sonet sdh networks  and fiscal we combined with optium  a leading designer and manufacturer of high performance optical subsystems for use in telecommunications and catv network systems to create the world s largest supplier of optical components  modules and subsystems for the communications industry and leverage the company s leadership position in the storage and data networking sectors of the industry and optium s leadership position in the telecommunications and catv sectors to create a more competitive industry participant 
as a result of these actions  we have developed a vertically integrated business model that operates best when our factory and laser production facilities are highly utilized 
in order to maintain our position as a leading supplier of fiber optic subsystems and components  we are continuing to pursue the following business strategies continue to invest in or acquire critical technologies 
our years of engineering experience  our multi disciplinary technical expertise and our participation in the development of industry standards have enabled us to become a leader in the design and development of fiber optic subsystems and components 
we have developed and acquired critical skills that we believe are essential to maintain a technological lead in our markets including high speed semiconductor laser design and wafer fabrication  complex logic and mixed signal integrated circuit design  optical subassembly design  software coding  system design  and manufacturing test design 
as a result of these technological capabilities  we have been at the forefront of a number of important breakthroughs in the development of innovative products for fiber optic applications 
in the process of investing in or acquiring critical technologies  we have obtained a number of us patents with other patent applications pending in addition to numerous foreign patents and patent applications 
we intend to maintain our technological leadership through continual enhancement of our existing products and the development or acquisition of new products  especially those capable of higher speed transmission of data  with greater capacity  over longer distances 
expand our broad product line of optical subsystems 
with the additional product lines added as a result of the optium merger  we now offer one of the broadest portfolios of optical subsystems which support a wide range of speeds  fiber types  voltages  wavelengths  distances and functionality and are available in a variety of industry standard packaging configurations  or form factors 
our optical subsystems are designed to 
table of contents comply with key networking protocols such as fibre channel  gigabit ethernet  gige and sonet and to plug directly into standard port configurations used in our customers products 
the breadth of our optical subsystems product line is important to many of our customers who are seeking to consolidate their supply sources for a wide range of networking products for diverse applications  and we are focused on the ongoing expansion of our product line to add key products to meet our customers needs  particularly for gigabit ethernet and sonet applications 
where time to market considerations are especially important in order to secure or enhance our supplier relationships with key customers  we may elect to acquire additional product lines 
leverage core competencies across multiple  high growth markets 
we believe that fiber optic technology will remain the transmission technology of choice for multiple data communication markets  including gigabit and gigabit ethernet based lans and mans  fibre channel based sans and sonet based mans and wans 
these markets are characterized by differentiated applications with unique design criteria such as product function  performance  cost  in system monitoring  size limitations  physical medium and software 
we intend to target opportunities where our core competencies in high speed data transmission protocols can be leveraged into leadership positions as these technologies are extended across multiple data communications applications and into other markets and industries such as automotive and consumer electronics products 
strengthen and expand customer relationships 
over the past years  we have established valuable relationships and a loyal base of customers by providing high quality products and superior service 
our service oriented approach has allowed us to work closely with leading data and storage network system manufacturers  understand and address their current needs and anticipate their future requirements 
we intend to leverage our relationships with our existing customers as they enter new  high speed data communications markets 
continue to strengthen our low cost manufacturing capabilities 
we believe that new markets can be created by the introduction of new  low cost  high value added products 
lower product costs can be achieved through the introduction of new technologies  product design or market presence 
access to low cost manufacturing resources is a key factor in the ability to offer a low cost product solution 
we have acquired manufacturing facilities in ipoh  malaysia and shanghai  china in order to take advantage of low cost  off shore labor while protecting access to our intellectual property and know how 
in addition  access to critical underlying technologies  such as our laser manufacturing and ic design capabilities enables us to accelerate our product development efforts to be able to introduce new low cost products more quickly 
we continue to seek ways to lower our production costs through improved product design  improved manufacturing and testing processes and increased vertical integration 
products in accordance with the guidelines established by the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  we have determined that we operate in two segments optical subsystems and components  and network test systems 
we provide a broad line of complementary products within each of these segments 
upon the completion of the sale of the network test business  we will operate in a single segment 
optical subsystems and components our optical subsystems are integrated into our customers systems and used for both short and intermediate distance fiber optic communications applications 
our family of optical subsystem products consists of transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders principally based on the gigabit ethernet  fibre channel and sonet protocols 
a transmitter converts electrical signals into optical signals for transmission over fiber optics 
receivers incorporating photo detectors convert incoming optical signals into electric signals 
a transceiver combines both transmitter and receiver functions in a single device 
a transponder includes an ic to provide the serializer deserializer function that otherwise resides in the customer s equipment if a transceiver is used 
our optical subsystem products perform these functions with high 
table of contents reliability and data integrity and support a wide range of protocols  transmission speeds  fiber types  wavelengths  transmission distances  physical configurations and software enhancements 
our high speed fiber optic subsystems are engineered to deliver value added functionality and intelligence 
most of our optical subsystem products include a microprocessor with proprietary embedded software that allows customers to monitor transmitted and received optical power  temperature  drive current and other link parameters of each port on their systems in real time

these capabilities are made possible in part through the use of a unique technology known as liquid crystal on silicon  or lcos  currently used in making television sets 
the technology provides a highly flexible wss switch capable of operating on both and ghz international telecommunications union grids  the capability for in service upgrades of functionality and integration of additional system functionality  
table of contents including drop and continue  channel monitoring and channel contouring 
revenues from the sale of this product totaled approximately million for the last the last eight months of fiscal network performance test systems our testing and analysis solutions allow engineers  service technicians and network managers to generate and capture data at high speeds  filter the data  identify various types of intermittent errors and verify protocol compliance for sans and lans  including emerging technologies such as voip  gige  iscsi  sas sata and fcoe 
our network performance test products are sold primarily to system manufacturers who use such equipment in the development of new products for sans 
because of our early work in developing the fibre channel standard for storage networks we have cultivated a leading share of the test equipment market for san applications 
on july   we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our network performance test business to jds uniphase corporation 
the sale is expected to be completed on or about july  customers to date  our revenues have been principally derived from sales of optical subsystems and components to a broad base of original equipment manufacturers 
sales to these customers accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal and in fiscal and  with the remainder of revenues in each year representing sales of network performance test systems 
sales of products for lan and san applications represented  and of our total optical subsystems revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our network performance test systems are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers for testing and validating equipment designs 
most of our network performance test revenues in fiscal were derived from sales of test equipment to manufacturers of san networking equipment 
sales to our top three customers represented approximately of our total revenues in each of fiscal years  and sales to cisco systems accounted for  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in any of these years 
technology the development of high quality fiber optic subsystems and components and network performance test systems for high speed data communications requires multidisciplinary expertise in the following technology areas high frequency integrated circuit design 
our fiber optic subsystems development efforts are supported by an engineering team that specialized in analog digital integrated circuit design 
this group works in both silicon  or si cmos  and silicon germanium  or sige bicmos  semiconductor technologies where circuit element frequencies are very fast and can be as high as gbps 
we have designed proprietary circuits including laser drivers  receiver pre and post amplifiers and controller circuits for handling digital diagnostics at     and gbps 
these advanced semiconductor devices provide significant cost advantages and will be critical in the development of future products capable of even faster data rates 
optical subassembly and mechanical design 
we established ourselves as a low cost design leader beginning with our initial gbps optical subsystems in from that base we have developed single mode laser alignment approaches and low cost  all metal packaging techniques for improved emi performance and environmental tolerance 
we develop our own component and packaging designs and integrate these designs with proprietary manufacturing processes that allow our products to be manufactured in high volume 
system design 
the design of all of our products requires a combination of sophisticated technical competencies optical engineering  high speed digital and analog design  asic design and software engineering 
we have built an organization of people with skills in all of these areas 
it is the integration of these technical competencies that enables us to produce products that meet the needs of our customers 
our combination of these technical competencies has enabled us to design and manufacture optical subsystems with built in optical test multiplexing and network monitoring  as well as test systems that integrate optical and protocol testing with user interface software 

table of contents manufacturing system design 
the design skills gained in our test systems group are also used in the manufacture of our optical subsystems 
we utilize our high speed fpga design blocks and concepts and gui software elements to provide specialized manufacturing test systems for our internal use 
these test systems are optimized for test capacity and broad test coverage 
we use automated  software controlled testing to enhance the field reliability of all finisar products 
all of our products are subjected to temperature testing of powered systems as well as full functional tests 
optoelectronic device design and wafer fabrication 
the ability to manufacture our own optical components can provide significant cost savings while the ability to create unique component designs  enhances our competitive position in terms of performance  time to market and intellectual property 
we design and manufacture a number of active components that are used in our optical subsystems 
our acquisition of honeywell s vcsel optical products business unit in march provided us with wafer fabrication capability for designing and manufacturing all of the nm vcsel components used in our short distance transceivers for lan and san applications 
these applications represented of our optical subsystem revenues in fiscal the acquisition of genoa corporation in april provided us with a state of the art foundry for the manufacture of pin detectors and nm fp and dfb lasers used in our longer distance transceivers  although we continue to rely on third party suppliers for a portion of our dfb laser requirements 
these longer distance transceiver products comprised approximately of our optical subsystem revenues in fiscal competition several of our competitors in the optical subsystems and components market have recently been acquired or announced plans to be acquired 
these announcements reflect an ongoing realignment of industry capacity with market demand in order to restore the financial health of the optics industry 
despite this trend  the market for optical subsystems and components for use in lans  sans and mans as well as the market for network performance test systems remains highly competitive 
we believe the principal competitive factors in these markets are product performance  features  functionality and reliability  price performance characteristics  timeliness of new product introductions  breadth of product line  adoption of emerging industry standards  service and support  size and scope of distribution network  brand name  access to customers  and size of installed customer base 
competition in the market for optical subsystems and components varies by market segment 
our principal competitors for optical transceivers sold for applications based on the fibre channel and ethernet protocols include avago technologies formerly part of agilent technologies and jds uniphase 
our principal competitors for optical transceivers sold for man and telecom applications based on the sonet sdh protocols include oclaro  formed with the merger of bookham and avanex  opnext and sumitomo and 
we believe we compete favorably with our competitors with respect to most of the foregoing factors based  in part  upon our broad product line  our sizeable installed base  our significant vertical integration and our low cost manufacturing facility in ipoh  malaysia 
we believe that the recent introduction of a number of products for gige applications has strengthened our position in the optical subsystem market 
we believe that our xgig product line for testing multiple network 
table of contents protocols within the same hardware platform has strengthened our competitive position within the network performance test systems market 
sales  marketing and technical support for sales of our optical subsystems and components  we utilize a direct sales force augmented by one world wide distributor  ten international distributors  three domestic distributors  domestic manufacturers representatives and three international manufacturers representatives 
for sales of our network performance test systems  we utilize a direct sales force augmented by domestic manufacturers representatives and international resellers 
our direct sales force maintains close contact with our customers and provides technical support to our manufacturers representatives 
in our international markets  our direct sales force works with local resellers who assist us in providing support and maintenance in the territories they cover 
our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness of our product offerings for optical subsystems and network performance test systems and our brand name 
key components of our marketing efforts include continuing our active participation in industry associations and standards committees to promote and further enhance gigabit ethernet  fibre channel and sas sata technologies  promote standardization in the lan  san and man markets  and increase our visibility as industry experts  leveraging major trade show events and lan  san  and man conferences to promote our broad product lines  and promoting our network performance test systems products in industry publications and other electronic media 
in addition  our marketing group provides marketing support services for our executive staff  our direct sales force and our manufacturers representatives and resellers 
through our marketing activities  we provide technical and strategic sales support to our direct sales personnel and resellers  including in depth product presentations  technical manuals  sales tools  pricing  marketing communications  marketing research  trademark administration and other support functions 
a high level of continuing service and support is critical to our objective of developing long term customer relationships 
we emphasize customer service and technical support in order to provide our customers and their end users with the knowledge and resources necessary to successfully utilize our product line 
our customer service organization utilizes a technical team of field and factory applications engineers  technical marketing personnel and  when required  product design engineers 
we provide extensive customer support throughout the qualification and sale process 
in addition  we provide many resources through our world wide web site  including product documentation and technical information 
we intend to continue to provide our customers with comprehensive product support and believe it is critical to remaining competitive 
backlog a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to oems through hub arrangements where revenue is generated as inventory that resides at these customers or their contract manufacturers is drawn down 
visibility as to future customer demand is limited in these situations 
most of our other revenues are derived from sales pursuant to individual purchase orders which remain subject to negotiation with respect to delivery schedules and are generally cancelable without significant penalties 
manufacturing capacity and availability of key components can also impact the timing and amount of revenue ultimately recognized under such sale arrangements 
accordingly  we do not believe that the backlog of undelivered product under these purchase orders are a meaningful indicator of our future financial performance 
manufacturing we manufacture most of our optical subsystems at our production facility in ipoh  malaysia 
this facility consists of  square feet  of which  square feet is suitable for cleanroom operations 
the acquisition of this facility has allowed us to transfer most of our manufacturing processes from contract manufacturers to a 
table of contents lower cost manufacturing facility and to maintain greater control over our intellectual property 
we expect to continue to use contract manufacturers for a portion of our manufacturing needs 
we conduct a portion of our new product introduction operations at our ipoh  malaysia facility 
we manufacture certain passive optical components used in our long wavelength products for man applications at our facility in shanghai  china which we expanded to  square feet in october we continue to conduct a portion of our new product introduction activities at our sunnyvale facility where we also conduct supply chain management for certain components  quality assurance and documentation control operations 
we conduct wafer fabrication operations for the manufacture of vcsels used in lan and san applications at our facility in allen  texas 
we conduct wafer fabrication operations for the manufacture of long wavelength fp and dfb lasers at our facility in fremont  california 
as a result of the optium merger  we now manufacture products in a  square foot facility in horsham  pennsylvania  and in a  square foot facility in waterloo  australia 
although we expect to transfer the manufacturing of certain products to malaysia and china in fiscal  we expect to retain these primarily facilities as research and development centers 
we design and develop a number of the key components of our products  including photodetectors  lasers  asics  printed circuit boards and software 
in addition  our manufacturing team works closely with our engineers to manage the supply chain 
to assure the quality and reliability of our products  we conduct product testing and burn in at our facilities in conjunction with inspection and the use of testing and statistical process controls 
in addition  most of our optical subsystems have an intelligent interface that allows us to monitor product quality during the manufacturing process 
our facilities in sunnyvale  fremont  allen  shanghai and malaysia are qualified under iso although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible  we currently purchase several key components from single or limited sources 
our principal single source components purchased from external suppliers include asics and certain dfb lasers that we do not manufacture internally 
in addition  all of the short wavelength vcsel lasers used in our lan and san products are currently produced at our facility in allen  texas 
generally  purchase commitments with our single or limited source suppliers are on a purchase order basis 
we generally try to maintain a buffer inventory of key components 
however  any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components  or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  would substantially harm our business 
in addition  qualifying additional suppliers can be time consuming and expensive and may increase the likelihood of errors 
we use a rolling month forecast of anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the demand for such components in relation to each supplier s manufacturing capacity  internal manufacturing capacity  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
research and development in fiscal  and  our research and development expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological competitiveness 
we focus our product development activities on addressing the evolving needs of our customers within the lan  san and man markets  although we also are seeking to leverage our core competencies by developing products for other applications 
we work closely with our original equipment manufacturers and system integrators to monitor changes in the marketplace 
we design our products around current industry standards and will continue to support emerging standards that are consistent with our product strategy 
our research and development groups are aligned with our various product lines  and we also have specific groups devoted to asic design and test  subsystem design  and test equipment hardware and software design 
our product development operations include the active involvement of our manufacturing engineers who examine each product for its manufacturability  predicted reliability  expected lifetime and manufacturing costs 
we believe that our research and development efforts are key to our ability to maintain technical competitiveness and to deliver innovative products that address the needs of the market 
however  there can be no assurance 
table of contents that our product development efforts will result in commercially successful products  or that our products will not be rendered obsolete by changing technology or new product announcements by other companies 
intellectual property our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we currently own issued us patents and patent applications with additional foreign counterparts 
we have agreed to transfer of these patents and of these patent applications to jdsu in connection with the pending sale of our network performance test systems business 
we cannot assure you that any patents will issue as a result of pending patent applications or that our issued patents will be upheld 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
we are currently engaged in pending litigation to enforce certain of our patents see item legal proceedings  and additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business 
the networking industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  other parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could significantly harm our business 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could significantly harm our business 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  our agreements with our customers typically require us to indemnify our customers from any expense or liability resulting from claimed infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
in the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business would be significantly harmed 
employees as of april   we employed approximately  full time employees  of whom were located in the united states and  of whom were located at our production facilities in ipoh  malaysia  shanghai  china and our singapore facility where we conduct research and development activities 
we also from time to time employ part time employees and hire contractors 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe that there is a positive employee relations environment within the company

risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks  including those described below 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to the other information contained in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
we may have insufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  including payments due on our subordinated convertible notes 
we will be required to generate cash sufficient to conduct our business operations and pay our indebtedness and other liabilities  including all amounts due on our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes due october  totaling million and our convertible subordinated notes due october  totaling million 
in addition  the million in principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes that mature in october include a net share settlement feature under which we are required to pay the principal portion of the notes in cash upon conversion 
our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are not sufficient to repay these notes  and we may not be able to cover our future debt service obligations from our operating cash flow 
we have recently implemented a series of cost control measures  but these measures alone will not be sufficient to generate the cash necessary to repay our outstanding notes 
we have also announced the commencement of the exchange offers in order to reduce the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness under the notes due in there can be no assurance that the exchange offers will be successfully completed 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  including the notes due in october we may not be able to obtain additional capital in the future  and failure to do so may harm our business 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with the cash expected to be generated from future operations and borrowings under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may  however  require additional financing to fund our operations in the future or to repay the principal of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes which mature in october due to the unpredictable nature of the capital markets  particularly in the technology sector  we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if and when it is required  especially if we experience disappointing operating results 
if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  we could be required to significantly reduce or restructure our business operations 
if we do raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
we expect that our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected following the completion of the pending sale of our network performance test systems business 
on july   we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our network tools division excluding accounts receivable and payable to jdsu for million in cash 
following the completion of the sale  we will no longer offer network performance test products 
these products accounted for million  million and million in revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit and operating profit margins on sales of network performance test products have generally been higher than on our optical subsystem and component products 
accordingly  we expect that our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected following the sale unless and until we are able to achieve significant growth in our optical subsystems and components business 

table of contents our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for our products  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us and our competitors  the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products  the timing or cancellation of large customer orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  pricing policy changes by us and our competitors and suppliers  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  increased competition in product lines  and competitive pricing pressures  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our optical components and subsystems 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including fluctuations in manufacturing yields  the emergence of new industry standards  failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  the loss or gain of important customers  product obsolescence  and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
our operating results could also be harmed by the continuation or worsening of the current global economic slowdown or economic conditions in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business  acts of terrorism and international conflicts or crises  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  or a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the data storage and networking and telecommunications components markets 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons 
orders at the beginning of each quarter typically represent a small percentage of expected revenues for that quarter and are generally cancelable with minimal notice 
accordingly  we depend on obtaining orders during each quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  our customer agreements typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant penalty 
because we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our business 
it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will again decrease from the previous quarter or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  it is likely that the trading price of our common stock would significantly decline 

table of contents as a result of these factors  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by the investment community could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock 
we may lose sales if our suppliers or independent contractors fail to meet our needs or go out of business 
we currently purchase a number of key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources  and we rely on several independent contract manufacturers to supply us with certain key subassemblies  including lasers  modulators  and printed circuit boards 
we depend on these sources to meet our production needs 
moreover  we depend on the quality of the components and subassemblies that they supply to us  over which we have limited control 
several of our suppliers are or may become financially unstable as the result of current global market conditions 
in addition  we have encountered shortages and delays in obtaining components in the past and expect to encounter additional shortages and delays in the future 
recently  many of our suppliers have extended lead times for many of their products as the result of significantly reducing capacity in light of the global slowdown in demand 
this reduction in capacity has reduced the ability of many suppliers to respond to increases in demand 
if we cannot supply products due to a lack of components  or are unable to redesign products with other components in a timely manner  our business will be significantly harmed 
we generally have no long term contracts with any of our component suppliers or contract manufacturers 
as a result  a supplier or contract manufacturer can discontinue supplying components or subassemblies to us without penalty 
if a supplier were to discontinue supplying a key component or cease operations  our business may be harmed by the resulting product manufacturing and delivery delays 
we are also subject to potential delays in the development by our suppliers of key components which may affect our ability to introduce new products 
similarly  disruptions in the services provided by our contract manufacturers or the transition to other suppliers of these services could lead to supply chain problems or delays in the delivery of our products 
these problems or delays could damage our relationships with our customers and adversely affect our business 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component and subassembly requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for particular components 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business 
if we are unable to realize anticipated cost savings from the transfer of certain manufacturing operations to our overseas locations and increased use of internally manufactured components our results of operations could be harmed 
as part of our cost of goods sold cost reduction initiatives planned for the next several quarters  we expect to realize significant cost savings through i the transfer of certain product manufacturing operations to lower cost off shore locations and ii product engineering changes to enable the broader use of internally manufactured components 
the transfer of production to overseas locations may be more difficult and costly than we currently anticipate  which could result in increased transfer costs and time delays 
further  following transfer  we may experience lower manufacturing yields than those historically achieved in our us manufacturing locations 
in addition  the engineering changes required for the use of internally manufactured components may be more technically challenging than we anticipate and customer acceptance of such changes could be delayed 
if we fail to achieve the planned product manufacturing transfer and increase in internally manufactured component use within our currently anticipated time frame  or if our manufacturing yields decrease as a result  our actual cost savings will be less than anticipated and our results of operations could be harmed 

table of contents failure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or non cancellable purchase commitments 
we base many of our operating decisions  and enter into purchase commitments  on the basis of anticipated revenue trends which are highly unpredictable 
some of our purchase commitments are not cancelable  and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing the amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered which exceeds our actual requirements 
in the past  we have sometimes experienced significant growth followed by a significant decrease in customer demand such as occurred in fiscal  when revenues increased by followed by a decrease of in fiscal based on projected revenue trends during these periods  we acquired inventories and entered into purchase commitments in order to meet anticipated increases in demand for our products which did not materialize 
as a result  we recorded significant charges for obsolete and excess inventories and non cancelable purchase commitments which contributed to substantial operating losses in fiscal should revenues in future periods again fall substantially below our expectations  or should we fail again to accurately forecast changes in demand mix  we could be required to record additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or non cancelable purchase commitments 
if we encounter sustained yield problems or other delays in the production or delivery of our internally manufactured components or in the final assembly and test of our transceiver products  we may lose sales and damage our customer relationships 
our manufacturing operations are highly vertically integrated 
in order to reduce our manufacturing costs  we have acquired a number of companies  and business units of other companies  that manufacture optical components incorporated in our optical subsystem products and have developed our own facilities for the final assembly and testing of our products 
for example  we design and manufacture many critical components including all of the short wavelength vcsel lasers incorporated in transceivers used for lan san applications at our wafer fabrication facility in allen  texas and manufacture a portion of our internal requirements for longer wavelength lasers at our wafer fabrication facility in fremont  california 
we assemble and test most of our transceiver products at our facility in ipoh  malaysia 
as a result of this vertical integration  we have become increasingly dependent on our internal production capabilities 
the manufacture of critical components  including the fabrication of wafers  and the assembly and testing of our products  involve highly complex processes 
for example  minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the components on a wafer to be nonfunctional 
these problems may be difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and often are time consuming and expensive to correct 
from time to time  we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields at our wafer fabrication facilities  resulting in delays in the availability of components 
moreover  an increase in the rejection rate of products during the quality control process before  during or after manufacture  results in lower yields and margins 
in addition  changes in manufacturing processes required as a result of changes in product specifications  changing customer needs and the introduction of new product lines have historically significantly reduced our manufacturing yields  resulting in low or negative margins on those products 
poor manufacturing yields over a prolonged period of time could adversely affect our ability to deliver our subsystem products to our customers and could also affect our sale of components to customers in the merchant market 
our inability to supply components to meet our internal needs could harm our relationships with customers and have an adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on widespread market acceptance of our optical subsystems and components  and our revenues will decline if the markets for these products do not expand as expected 
we currently derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of our optical subsystems and components 
we expect that revenue from these products will continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  widespread acceptance of these products is critical to our future success 
if the market does not continue to accept our optical subsystems and components  our revenues will decline significantly 
our future success ultimately depends on the continued growth of the communications industry and  in particular  the continued expansion of global information networks  particularly those directly or indirectly dependent upon a fiber optics infrastructure 
as part of that growth  we are relying on increasing demand for voice  video and other data delivered over high bandwidth network systems as well as commitments by network systems 
table of contents vendors to invest in the expansion of the global information network 
as network usage and bandwidth demand increase  so does the need for advanced optical networks to provide the required bandwidth 
without network and bandwidth growth  the need for optical subsystems and components  and hence our future growth as a manufacturer of these products  and systems that test these products  will be jeopardized  and our business would be significantly harmed 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  in order to achieve widespread market acceptance  we must differentiate ourselves from our competition through product offerings and brand name recognition 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in making this differentiation or achieving widespread acceptance of our products 
failure of our existing or future products to maintain and achieve widespread levels of market acceptance will significantly impair our revenue growth 
we depend on large purchases from a few significant customers  and any loss  cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business 
a small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
for example  sales to finisar s top five customers represented of its revenues in fiscal our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers 
although we are attempting to expand our customer base  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
we may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers  and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced or delayed 
the markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers  thereby limiting the number of our potential customers 
recent consolidation of portions of our customer base  including telecommunications systems manufacturers  and potential future consolidation may have a material adverse impact on our business 
our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers  that we will be able to attract additional customers or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products 
we have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers 
in addition  our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us  and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future 
cost reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years  and additional action we may take to reduce costs  may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products which may  in turn  adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers 
further  some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors 
the loss of one or more of our largest customers  any reduction or delay in sales to these customers  our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time if we fail to meet our customers needs 
typically  we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  and our customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
sales are typically made pursuant to inventory hub arrangements under which customers may draw down inventory to satisfy their demand as needed or pursuant to individual purchase orders  often with extremely short lead times 
if we are unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner  it is likely that we will lose sales and customers 
if our major customers stop purchasing our products for any reason  our business and results of operations would be harmed 

table of contents the markets for our products are subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  substantial capital investment  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards with respect to the protocols used in data communications  telecommunications and cable tv networks 
our future performance will depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address these changes as well as current and potential customer requirements 
for example  the market for optical subsystems is currently characterized by a trend toward the adoption of pluggable modules and subsystems that do not require customized interconnections and by the development of more complex and integrated optical subsystems 
we expect that new technologies will emerge as competition and the need for higher and more cost effective bandwidth increases 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
in addition  a slowdown in demand for existing products ahead of a new product introduction could result in a write down in the value of inventory on hand related to existing products 
we have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for existing products and delays in new product development and such delays may occur in the future 
to the extent customers defer or cancel orders for existing products due to a slowdown in demand or in the expectation of a new product release or if there is any delay in development or introduction of our new products or enhancements of our products  our operating results would suffer 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements  or to license these technologies from third parties 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  unanticipated engineering complexities  expense reduction measures we have implemented  and others we may implement  to conserve our cash and attempt to achieve and sustain profitability  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  and changing market or competitive product requirements 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the introduction of new products also requires significant investment to ramp up production capacity  for which benefit will not be realized if customer demand does not develop as expected 
ramping of production capacity also entails risks of delays which can limit our ability to realize the full benefit of the new product introduction 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change would significantly harm our business 
continued competition in our markets may lead to an accelerated reduction in our prices  revenues and market share 
the end markets for optical products have experienced significant industry consolidation during the past few years while the industry that supplies these customers has not 
as a result  the markets for optical subsystems and components and network test systems are highly competitive 
our current competitors include a number of domestic and international companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources and brand name recognition than we have 
we may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors 
companies competing with us may introduce products that are competitively priced  have increased performance or functionality  or incorporate technological advances and may be able to react quicker to changing customer requirements and expectations 
there is also the risk that network 
table of contents systems vendors may re enter the subsystem market and begin to manufacture the optical subsystems incorporated in their network systems 
increased competition could result in significant price erosion  reduced revenue  lower margins or loss of market share  any of which would significantly harm our business 
for optical subsystems  we compete primarily with avago technologies  capella intelligent subsystems  coadna photonics  emcore  fujitsu computer systems  jds uniphase  opnext  oplink  stratalight communications  sumitomo  and a number of smaller vendors 
bktel  emcore  olson technology and yagi antenna are our main competitors with respect to our cable tv products 
for network test systems  we compete primarily with agilent technologies and lecroy 
our competitors continue to introduce improved products and we will have to do the same to remain competitive 
decreases in average selling prices of our products may reduce our gross margins 
the market for optical subsystems is characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from factors such as increased competition  overcapacity  the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes as manufacturers continue to deploy network and storage systems 
we have in the past experienced  and in the future may experience  substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to declining average selling prices 
we anticipate that average selling prices will decrease in the future in response to product introductions by competitors or us  or by other factors  including pricing pressures from significant customers 
therefore  in order to achieve and sustain profitable operations  we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
failure to do so could cause our revenues and gross margins to decline  which would result in additional operating losses and significantly harm our business 
we may be unable to reduce the cost of our products sufficiently to enable us to compete with others 
our cost reduction efforts may not allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures and could adversely affect our margins 
in order to remain competitive  we must continually reduce the cost of manufacturing our products through design and engineering changes 
we may not be successful in redesigning our products or delivering our products to market in a timely manner 
we cannot assure you that any redesign will result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce the price of our products to remain competitive or improve our gross margins 
shifts in our product mix may result in declines in gross margins 
our gross profit margins vary among our product families  and are generally higher on our network test systems than on our optical subsystems and components 
our optical products sold for longer distance man and telecom applications typically have higher gross margins than our products for shorter distance lan or san applications 
gross margins on individual products fluctuate over the product s life cycle 
our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix  the introduction of new products  decreases in average selling prices for older products and our ability to reduce product costs  and these fluctuations are expected to continue in the future 
our customers often evaluate our products for long and variable periods  which causes the timing of our revenues and results of operations to be unpredictable 
the period of time between our initial contact with a customer and the receipt of an actual purchase order may span a year or more 
during this time  customers may perform  or require us to perform  extensive and lengthy evaluation and testing of our products before purchasing and using the products in their equipment 
these products often take substantial time to develop because of their complexity and because customer specifications sometimes change during the development cycle 
our customers do not typically share information on the duration or magnitude of these qualification procedures 
the length of these qualification processes also may vary substantially by product and customer  and  thus  cause our results of operations to be unpredictable 
while our potential customers are qualifying our products and before they place an order with us  we may incur substantial research and development and sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
even after incurring such costs we ultimately may not sell any products to such potential customers 
in addition  these qualification processes often make it difficult to obtain new customers  as customers are reluctant to expend the resources necessary to qualify a new supplier if they have one or more existing qualified sources 
once our products have been qualified  the agreements that we enter into with our customers typically contain no minimum purchase 
table of contents commitments 
failure of our customers to incorporate our products into their systems would significantly harm our business 
we will lose sales if we are unable to obtain government authorization to export certain of our products  and we would be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations 
exports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the us government and administered by the united states departments of state and commerce 
in certain instances  these regulations may require pre shipment authorization from the administering department 
for products subject to the export administration regulations  or ear  administered by the department of commerce s bureau of industry and security  the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product  the final destination  the identity of the end user and whether a license exception might apply 
virtually all exports of products subject to the international traffic in arms regulations  or itar  administered by the department of state s directorate of defense trade controls  require a license 
certain of our fiber optics products are subject to ear and certain of our rf over fiber products  as well as certain products developed with government funding  are currently subject to itar 
products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation 
given the current global political climate  obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time consuming 
failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with us government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and costs 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position 
during mid  optium became aware that certain of its analog rf over fiber products may  depending on end use and customization  be subject to itar 
accordingly  optium filed a detailed voluntary disclosure with the department of state describing the details of possible inadvertent itar violations with respect to the export of a limited number of certain prototype products  as well as related technical data and defense services 
optium may have also made unauthorized transfers of itar restricted technical data and defense services to foreign persons in the workplace 
additional information has been provided upon request to the department of state with respect to this matter 
in late  a grand jury subpoena from the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania was received requesting documents from through the present referring to  relating to or involving the subject matter of the above referenced voluntary disclosure and export activities 
while the department of state encourages voluntary disclosures and generally affords parties mitigating credit under such circumstances  we nevertheless could be subject to continued investigation and potential regulatory consequences ranging from a no action letter  government oversight of facilities and export transactions  monetary penalties  and in extreme cases  debarment from government contracting  denial of export privileges and criminal sanctions  any of which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
the department of state and us attorney inquiries may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses 
we cannot predict how long it will take or how much more time and resources it will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries  nor can it predict the outcome of these inquiries 
we depend on facilities located outside of the united states to manufacture a substantial portion of our products  which subjects us to additional risks 
in addition to our principal manufacturing facility in malaysia  we operate smaller facilities in australia  china  israel and singapore 
we also rely on several contract manufacturers located in asia for our supply of key subassemblies 
each of these facilities and manufacturers subjects us to additional risks associated with international manufacturing  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  legal uncertainties regarding liability  tariffs and other trade barriers  inadequate protection of intellectual property in some countries  
table of contents greater incidence of shipping delays  greater difficulty in overseeing manufacturing operations  greater difficulty in hiring talent needed to oversee manufacturing operations  potential political and economic instability  and the outbreak of infectious diseases such as the hn influenza virus and or severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  which could result in travel restrictions or the closure of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers 
any of these factors could significantly impair our ability to source our contract manufacturing requirements internationally 
our future operating results may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to foreign exchange risks 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risks 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect both our revenues and our costs and expenses and significantly affect our operating results 
prices for our products are currently denominated in us dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country relative to the dollar  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency  our products may be less competitive in that country and our revenues may be adversely affected 
although we price our products in us dollars  portions of both our cost of revenues and operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies  principally the malaysian ringgit  the chinese yuan  the australian dollar and the israeli shekel 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in one or more countries will exceed the rate of the devaluation of that country s currency in relation to the us dollar  which would increase our costs as expressed in us dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our business and future operating results are subject to a wide range of uncertainties arising out of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks and ongoing military actions in the middle east 
like other us companies  our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks on the united states and ongoing military actions in the middle east  including the economic consequences of the war in iraq or additional terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
in particular  due to these uncertainties we are subject to increased risks related to the operations of our manufacturing facilities in malaysia  greater risks of disruption in the operations of our china  singapore  and israeli facilities and our asian contract manufacturers and more frequent instances of shipping delays  and the risk that future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non us engineers and other key technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities 
past and future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
in addition to our recent combination with optium  we have completed the acquisition of ten privately held companies and certain businesses and assets from six other companies since october we continue to review opportunities to acquire other businesses  product lines or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities  and we from time to time make proposals and offers  and take other steps  to acquire businesses  products and technologies 

table of contents the optium merger and several of our other past acquisitions have been material  and acquisitions that we may complete in the future may be material 
in of our acquisitions  we issued common stock or notes convertible into common stock as all or a portion of the consideration 
the issuance of common stock or other equity securities by us in any future transaction would dilute our stockholders percentage ownership 
other risks associated with acquiring the operations of other companies include problems assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
not all of our past acquisitions have been successful 
in the past  we have subsequently sold some of the assets acquired in prior acquisitions  discontinued product lines and closed acquired facilities 
as a result of these activities  we incurred significant restructuring charges and charges for the write down of assets associated with those acquisitions 
through fiscal  we have written off all of the goodwill associated with past acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with more recently completed acquisitions or potential future acquisitions  and our inability to do so could significantly harm our business 
in addition  to the extent that the economic benefits associated with any of our completed or future acquisitions diminish in the future  we may be required to record additional write downs of goodwill  intangible assets or other assets associated with such acquisitions  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we have made and may continue to make strategic investments which may not be successful  may result in the loss of all or part of our invested capital and may adversely affect our operating results 
through fiscal  we made minority equity investments in early stage technology companies  totaling approximately million 
our investments in these early stage companies were primarily motivated by our desire to gain early access to new technology 
we intend to review additional opportunities to make strategic equity investments in pre public companies where we believe such investments will provide us with opportunities to gain access to important technologies or otherwise enhance important commercial relationships 
we have little or no influence over the early stage companies in which we have made or may make these strategic  minority equity investments 
each of these investments in pre public companies involves a high degree of risk 
we may not be successful in achieving the financial  technological or commercial advantage upon which any given investment is premised  and failure by the early stage company to achieve its own business objectives or to raise capital needed on acceptable economic terms could result in a loss of all or part of our invested capital 
in fiscal  we wrote off million in two investments which became impaired 
in fiscal  we wrote off million in two additional investments  and in fiscal  we wrote off million in another investment 
during fiscal  we reclassified million of an investment associated with the infineon acquisition to goodwill as the investment was deemed to have no value 
during fiscal  we wrote off million for another investment that became impaired 
we may be required to write off all or a portion of the million in such investments remaining on our balance sheet as of april  in future periods 
we are subject to pending legal proceedings 
a securities class action lawsuit was filed on november  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from november  through december  the complaint named as defendants finisar  certain of our current and former officers  and an investment banking firm that served as an underwriter for our initial public offering in november and a secondary offering in april the complaint  as subsequently amended  alleges violations of sections and of the securities act of and sections b and b of the securities exchange act of no specific damages are claimed 
similar allegations have been made in lawsuits relating to more than other initial public offerings conducted in and  which were consolidated for pretrial 
table of contents purposes 
in october  all claims against the individual defendants were dismissed without prejudice 
on february   the court denied defendants motion to dismiss the complaint 
in february  the parties reached an understanding regarding the principal elements of a settlement  subject to formal documentation and court approval 
under the new proposed settlement  the underwriter defendants would pay a total of million  and the issuer defendants and their insurers would pay a total of million to settle all of the cases 
we would be responsible for a pro rata share of the issuers contribution to the settlement and certain costs anticipated to total between  and  if this settlement is not approved by the court  we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously 
because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation  we cannot predict its outcome 
if  as a result of this dispute  we are required to pay significant monetary damages  our business would be substantially harmed 
we have been named as a nominal defendant in several purported shareholder derivative lawsuits concerning the granting of stock options 
these cases have been consolidated into two proceedings pending in federal and state courts in california 
the plaintiffs in all of these cases have alleged that certain current or former officers and directors of finisar caused it to grant stock options at less than fair market value  contrary to our public statements including statements in our financial statements  and that  as a result  those officers and directors are liable to finisar 
no specific amount of damages has been alleged and  by the nature of the lawsuits no damages will be alleged  against finisar 
on may   the state court granted our motion to stay the state court action pending resolution of the consolidated federal court action 
on august   we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint which were granted on january  on may   the plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint in the federal court action 
on july   we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint 
we cannot predict whether these actions are likely to result in any material recovery by  or expense to  us 
we expect to continue to incur legal fees in responding to these lawsuits  including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations 
the expense of defending such litigation may be significant 
the amount of time to resolve these and any additional lawsuits is unpredictable and these actions may divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
because of competition for technical personnel  we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  technical  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
in particular  we may need to increase the number of technical staff members with experience in high speed networking applications as we further develop our product lines 
competition for these highly skilled employees in our industry is intense 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the equity they are to receive in connection with their employment 
therefore  significant volatility in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain technical personnel 
furthermore  changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states relating to the expensing of stock options may limit our ability to grant the sizes or types of stock awards that job candidates may require to accept employment with us 
our failure to attract and retain these qualified employees could significantly harm our business 
the loss of the services of any of our qualified employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could hinder the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
in addition  employees may leave our company and subsequently compete against us 
moreover  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have been subject to claims of this type and may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
some of these claims may result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
our failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our business 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements to establish 
table of contents and protect our proprietary rights 
we license certain of our proprietary technology  including our digital diagnostics technology  to customers who include current and potential competitors  and we rely largely on provisions of our licensing agreements to protect our intellectual property rights in this technology 
although a number of patents have been issued to us  we have obtained a number of other patents as a result of our acquisitions  and we have filed applications for additional patents  we cannot assure you that any patents will issue as a result of pending patent applications or that our issued patents will be upheld 
additionally  significant technology used in our product lines is not the subject of any patent protection  and we may be unable to obtain patent protection on such technology in the future 
any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs  and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive 
we are currently engaged in pending litigation to enforce certain of our patents  and additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
in connection with the pending litigation  substantial management time has been  and will continue to be  expended 
in addition  we have incurred  and we expect to continue to incur  substantial legal expenses in connection with these pending lawsuits 
these costs and this diversion of resources could significantly harm our business 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
the networking industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
we have been involved in the past as a defendant in patent infringement lawsuits  and are currently defending a patent infringement lawsuit filed against optium by jds uniphase corporation and emcore corporation 
from time to time  other parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could significantly harm our business 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could significantly harm our business 
in addition  our agreements with our customers typically require us to indemnify our customers from any expense or liability resulting from claimed infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
in the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business would be significantly harmed 
numerous patents in our industry are held by others  including academic institutions and competitors 
optical subsystem suppliers may seek to gain a competitive advantage or other third parties may seek an economic return on their intellectual property portfolios by making infringement claims against us 
in the future  we may need to obtain license rights to patents or other intellectual property held by others to the extent necessary for our business 
unless we are able to obtain those licenses on commercially reasonable terms  patents or other intellectual property held by others could inhibit our development of new products 
licenses granting us the right to use third party technology may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
generally  a license  if granted  would include payments of up front fees  ongoing royalties or both 
these payments or other terms could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 

table of contents our products may contain defects that may cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
our products are complex and defects may be found from time to time 
networking products frequently contain undetected software or hardware defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
in addition  our products are often embedded in or deployed in conjunction with our customers products which incorporate a variety of components produced by third parties 
as a result  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relation problems or loss of customers  all of which would harm our business 
our business and future operating results may be adversely affected by events outside our control 
our business and operating results are vulnerable to events outside of our control  such as earthquakes  fire  power loss  telecommunications failures and uncertainties arising out of terrorist attacks in the united states and overseas 
our corporate headquarters and a portion of our manufacturing operations are located in california 
california in particular has been vulnerable to natural disasters  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  and other risks which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we are also dependent on communications links with our overseas manufacturing locations and would be significantly harmed if these links were interrupted for any significant length of time 
we presently do not have adequate redundant  multiple site capacity if any of these events were to occur  nor can we be certain that the insurance we maintain against these events would be adequate 
the conversion of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes would result in substantial dilution to our current stockholders 
we currently have outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes due in the principal amount of million and convertible subordinated notes due in the principal amount of million 
the million in principal amount of our notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the million in principal amount of our senior notes are convertible at a conversion price of  with the underlying principal payable in cash  upon the trading price of our common stock reaching for a period of time 
an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock would be issued upon the conversion of all outstanding convertible subordinated notes at these exchange rates  which would dilute the voting power and ownership percentage of our existing stockholders 
we have previously entered into privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of our convertible subordinated notes for the repurchase of notes in exchange for a greater number of shares of our common stock than would have been issued had the principal amount of the notes been converted at the original conversion rate specified in the notes  thus resulting in more dilution 
although we do not currently have any plans to enter into similar transactions in the future  if we were to do so there would be additional dilution to the voting power and percentage ownership of our existing stockholders 
delaware law  our charter documents and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these include provisions authorizing the board of directors to issue additional preferred stock  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent  
table of contents creating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three year terms  permitting the board of directors to increase the size of the board and to fill vacancies  requiring a super majority vote of our stockholders to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which limit the right of a corporation to engage in a business combination with a holder of or more of the corporation s outstanding voting securities  or certain affiliated persons 
in addition  in september  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan under which our stockholders received one share purchase right for each share of our common stock held by them 
subject to certain exceptions  the rights become exercisable when a person or group other than certain exempt persons acquires  or announces its intention to commence a tender or exchange offer upon completion of which such person or group would acquire  or more of our common stock without prior board approval 
should such an event occur  then  unless the rights are redeemed or have expired  our stockholders  other than the acquirer  will be entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount from its then current market price as defined or  in the case of certain business combinations  purchase the common stock of the acquirer at a discount 
although we believe that these charter and bylaw provisions  provisions of delaware law and our stockholder rights plan provide an opportunity for the board to assure that our stockholders realize full value for their investment  they could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  even under circumstances that some stockholders may consider beneficial 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends on finisar common stock and  consequently  a stockholder s ability to achieve a return on such stockholder s investment will depend on appreciation in the price of the common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on finisar common stock and we do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to invest our future earnings  if any  to fund our growth 
therefore  a stockholder is not likely to receive any dividends on such stockholder s common stock for the foreseeable future 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
our stock price may increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors  including trends in our industry and the markets in which we operate  changes in the market price of the products we sell  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  acquisitions and financings  quarterly variations in our operating results  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors in our common stock may deem comparable  and purchases or sales of blocks of our common stock 
part of this volatility is attributable to the current state of the stock market  in which wide price swings are common 
this volatility may adversely affect the prices of our common stock regardless of our operating 
table of contents performance 
if any of the foregoing occurs  our stock price could fall and we may be exposed to class action lawsuits that  even if unsuccessful  could be costly to defend and a distraction to management

item legal proceedings stock option derivative litigation on november   we announced that we had undertaken a voluntary review of our historical stock option grant practices subsequent to our initial public offering in november the review was initiated by senior management  and preliminary results of the review were discussed with the audit committee of the our board of directors 
based on the preliminary results of the review  senior management concluded  and the audit 
table of contents committee agreed  that it was likely that the measurement dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates for such awards and that we would likely need to restate our historical financial statements to record non cash charges for compensation expense relating to some past stock option grants 
the audit committee thereafter conducted a further investigation and engaged independent legal counsel and financial advisors to assist in that investigation 
the audit committee concluded that measurement dates for certain option grants differed from the recorded grant dates for such awards 
our management  in conjunction with the audit committee  conducted a further review to finalize revised measurement dates and determine the appropriate accounting adjustments to our historical financial statements 
the announcement of the investigation resulted in delays in filing our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended october   january   and january  and our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended april  on december   we filed all four of these reports which included revised financial statements 
following our announcement on november  that the audit committee of the board of directors had voluntarily commenced an investigation of our historical stock option grant practices  we were named as a nominal defendant in several shareholder derivative cases 
these cases have been consolidated into two proceedings pending in federal and state courts in california 
the federal court cases have been consolidated in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
the state court cases have been consolidated in the superior court of california for the county of santa clara 
the plaintiffs in all cases have alleged that certain of our current or former officers and directors caused us to grant stock options at less than fair market value  contrary to our public statements including its financial statements  and that  as a result  those officers and directors are liable to us 
no specific amount of damages has been alleged  and by the nature of the lawsuits  no damages will be alleged against us 
on may   the state court granted our motion to stay the state court action pending resolution of the consolidated federal court action 
on june   the plaintiffs in the federal court case filed an amended complaint to reflect the results of the stock option investigation announced by the audit committee in june on august   we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint 
on january   the court granted the motions to dismiss  with leave to amend 
on may   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint on july  the court s ruling on the motions remains pending 
patent litigation directv litigation on april   we filed an action for patent infringement in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas against the directv group  inc  directv holdings  llc  directv enterprises  llc  directv operations  llc  directv  inc  and hughes network systems  inc collectively  directv 
the lawsuit involves our us patent no 
 or the patent  which relates to technology used in information transmission systems to provide access to a large database of information 
on june   following a jury trial  the jury returned a verdict that our patent had been willfully infringed and awarded us damages of  in a post trial hearing held on july   the court determined that  due to directv s willful infringement  those damages would be enhanced by an additional million 
further  the court awarded us pre judgment interest on the jury s verdict and court costs in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
the court denied our motion for injunctive relief  but ordered directv to pay a compulsory ongoing license fee to us at the rate of per set top box activated by or on behalf of directv for the period beginning june  through the duration of the patent  which expires in april directv appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
in its appeal  directv raised issues related to claim construction  infringement  invalidity  willful infringement and enhanced damages 
we cross appealed raising issues related to the denial of our motion for a permanent injunction  the trial court s refusal to enhance future damages for willfulness and the trial court s determination that some of the asserted patent claims are invalid 
the appeals were consolidated 
on april   the appeals court issued is decision affirming in part  reversing in part  and remanding the case for further proceedings before the trial court in texas 
specifically  the appeals court ruled that the lower court s interpretation of some of the patent claim terms was too broad and issued its own  narrower interpretation of 
table of contents those terms 
the appeals court also determined that one of the seven patent claims claim found infringed by the jury was invalid  that directv s infringement of the patent was not willful  and that the trial court did not err in its determination that various claims of the patent were invalid for indefiniteness 
as a result  the judgment  including the compulsory license  was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court to reconsider infringement and validity of the six remaining patent claims and releasing to directv the escrow funds it had deposited 
on july   the united states district court for the northern district of california issued an order in the comcast lawsuit described below in which it held that one of the claims of the patent  claim  is invalid 
the order in the comcast lawsuit also  in effect  ruled invalid a related claim  claim  which was one of the six remaining claims of the patent that were returned to the trial court for retrial in the directtv lawsuit 
on december   both parties filed motions for summary judgment in the trial court on the issue of validity 
on may   the court granted directv s motions for summary judgment and entered final judgment in the case in favor of directv 
we have filed a notice of appeal with respect to this ruling 
comcast litigation on july   comcast cable communications corporation  llc comcast  filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california  san francisco division 
comcast sought a declaratory judgment that our patent is not infringed and is invalid 
the patent is the same patent alleged by us in our lawsuit against directv 
at a status conference held on april   the court accepted our proposal to narrow the issues for trial and proceed only with our principal claim claim  subject to our providing a covenant not to sue comcast on the other previously asserted claims 
on may   comcast filed its renewed motion for summary judgment of invalidity and non infringement 
on july   the court issued an order granting comcast s motion for summary judgment on the basis of invalidity and also entered a final judgment in favor of comcast 
on july  we filed our notice of appeal to the federal circuit 
on april   the federal circuit affirmed the district court ruling 
echostar litigation on july   echostar satellite llc  echostar technologies corporation and nagrastar llc collectively  echostar  filed an action against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware seeking a declaration that echostar does not infringe  and has not infringed  any valid claim of our patent 
the patent is the same patent that is in dispute in the directv and comcast lawsuits 
on december   the court approved the parties stipulation to stay the case pending issuance of the federal circuit s mandate in the directv case 
this stay expired when the mandate of the federal circuit issued in the directv case on april  the court has yet to set a case schedule 
xm sirius litigation on april   we filed an action for patent infringement in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  lufkin division  against xm satellite radio holdings  inc  xm satellite radio  inc  and xm radio  inc 
collectively  xm  and sirius satellite radio  inc and satellite cd radio  inc 
collectively  sirius 
the lawsuit alleged that xm and sirius had infringed and continued to infringe our patent and sought an injunction to prevent further infringement  actual damages to be proven at trial  enhanced damages for willful infringement and attorneys fees 
the cased had been stayed pending further action in the directv case on remand and the re examination of the patent descried below 
subsequent to the may  decision granting summary judgment in favor of directv in the directv case  the case against xm sirius was dismissed without prejudice on june  
table of contents requests for re examination of the patent four requests for re examination of our patent have been filed with the pto 
the patent is the patent that is in dispute in the directv  echostar  comcast and xm sirius lawsuits 
the pto has granted each of these requests  and these proceedings have been combined into a single re examination 
during the re examination  some or all of the claims in the patent could be invalidated or revised to narrow their scope  either of which could have a material adverse impact on our position in the related lawsuits 
securities class action a securities class action lawsuit was filed on november  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased our common stock from november  through december  the complaint named as defendants finisar  jerry s 
rawls  our president and chief executive officer  frank h 
levinson  our former chairman of the board and chief technical officer  stephen k 
workman  our senior vice president  finance and chief financial officer  and an investment banking firm that served as an underwriter for our initial public offering in november and a secondary offering in april the complaint  as subsequently amended  alleges violations of sections and of the securities act of and sections b and b of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the prospectuses incorporated in the registration statements for the offerings failed to disclose  among other things  that i the underwriter had solicited and received excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors in exchange for which the underwriter allocated to those investors material portions of the shares of our stock sold in the offerings and ii the underwriter had entered into agreements with customers whereby the underwriter agreed to allocate shares of our stock sold in the offerings to those customers in exchange for which the customers agreed to purchase additional shares of our stock in the aftermarket at pre determined prices 
no specific damages are claimed 
similar allegations have been made in lawsuits relating to more than other initial public offerings conducted in and  which were consolidated for pretrial purposes 
in october  all claims against the individual defendants were dismissed without prejudice 
on february   the court denied defendants motion to dismiss the complaint 
in july  we and the individual defendants accepted a settlement proposal made to all of the issuer defendants 
under the terms of the settlement  the plaintiffs would dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants in exchange for a contingent payment guaranty by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all related cases  and the assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters 
under the guaranty  the insurers would have been required to pay the amount  if any  by which billion exceeds the aggregate amount ultimately collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all the cases 
if the plaintiffs failed to recover billion and payment was required under the guaranty  we would have been responsible to pay our pro rata portion of the shortfall  up to the amount of the self insured retention under its insurance policy  which could have been up to million 
the court gave preliminary approval to the settlement in february before the court issued a final decision on the settlement  on december   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit vacated the class certification of plaintiffs claims against the underwriters in six cases designated as focus or test cases 
thereafter  the parties withdrew the settlement 
in february  the parties reached an understanding regarding the principal elements of a settlement  subject to formal documentation and court approval 
under the new proposed settlement  the underwriter defendants would pay a total of million  and the issuer defendants and their insurers would pay a total of million to settle all of the cases 
we would be responsible for a pro rata share of the issuers contribution to the settlement and certain costs anticipated to total between  and  on june   the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and set a hearing on final approval for september  if this settlement is not approved by the court  we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously 
because of the inherent uncertainty of litigation  we cannot predict its outcome 
if  as a result of this dispute  we are required to pay significant monetary damages  our business would be substantially harmed 

table of contents section b lawsuit a lawsuit was filed on october  in the united states district court for the western district of washington by vanessa simmonds  a purported holder of our common stock  against two investment banking firms that served as underwriters for the initial public offering of finisar common stock in november none of our officers  directors or employees were named as defendants in the complaint 
on february   the plaintiff filed an amended complaint 
the complaint  as amended  alleges that i the defendants  other underwriters of the offering  and unspecified officers  directors and our principal shareholders constituted a group that owned in excess of of our outstanding common stock between november  and november   ii the defendants were therefore subject to the short swing prohibitions of section b of the securities exchange act of  and iii the defendants engaged in purchases and sales  or sales and purchases  of our common stock within periods of less than six months in violation of the provisions of section b 
the complaint seeks disgorgement of all profits allegedly received by the defendants  with interest and attorneys fees  for transactions in violation of section b 
finisar  as the statutory beneficiary of any potential section b recovery  is named as a nominal defendant in the complaint 
this case is one of lawsuits containing similar allegations relating to initial public offerings of technology company issuers  which were coordinated but not consolidated by the court 
on july   the real defendants in all cases filed a consolidated motion to dismiss  and a majority of the nominal defendants including us filed a consolidated motion to dismiss  the amended complaints 
on march   the court dismissed the amended complaints naming the nominal defendants that had moved to dismiss  without prejudice  because the plaintiff had not properly demanded action by their respective boards of directors before filing suit  and dismissed the amended complaints naming nominal defendants that had not moved to dismiss  with prejudice  finding the claims time barred by the applicable statute of limitation 
also on march   the court entered judgment against the plaintiff in all cases 
the plaintiff has appealed the order and judgments 
the real defendants have cross appealed the dismissal of certain amended complaints without prejudice  contending that dismissal should have been with prejudice because those amended complaints are barred by the applicable statute of limitation 
jdsu emcore patent litigation litigation is pending with jds uniphase corporation and emcore corporation with respect to certain cable television transmission products acquired in connection with our acquisition of optium corporation 
on september   jdsu and emcore filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging that our nm hfc externally modulated transmitter used in cable television applications  in addition to possibly products as yet unidentified  infringes on two us patents 
on march   jdsu and emcore filed a second complaint in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging that our nm hfc quadrature amplitude modulated transmitter used in cable television applications  in addition to possibly products as yet unidentified  infringes on another us patent 
we have answered both of these complaints denying that we have infringed any of the asserted patents and asserting that those patents are invalid 
the plaintiffs are seeking for the court to declare that optium has willfully infringed on such patents and to be awarded up to three times the amount of any compensatory damages found  if any  plus any other damages and costs incurred 
on december   we filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania seeking a declaration that the patents asserted against our hfc externally modulated transmitter are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct committed by the patent applicants and or the attorneys or agents during prosecution 
on february   the court granted jdsu s and emcore s motion for summary judgment dismissing our declaratory judgment action on inequitable conduct 
we have appealed this ruling 
the court has consolidated the remaining two actions and has scheduled a single trial to begin october  export compliance during mid  optium became aware that certain of its analog rf over fiber products may  depending on end use and customization  be subject to the international traffic in arms regulations  or itar 
accordingly  optium filed a detailed voluntary disclosure with the united states department of state describing the details of 
table of contents possible inadvertent itar violations with respect to the export of a limited number of certain prototype products  as well as related technical data and defense services 
optium may have also made unauthorized transfers of itar restricted technical data and defense services to foreign persons in the workplace 
additional information has been provided upon request to the department of state with respect to this matter 
in late  a grand jury subpoena from the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania was received requesting documents from through the present referring to  relating to or involving the subject matter of the above referenced voluntary disclosure and export activities 
while the department of state encourages voluntary disclosures and generally affords parties mitigating credit under such circumstances  we nevertheless could be subject to continued investigation and potential regulatory consequences ranging from a no action letter  government oversight of facilities and export transactions  monetary penalties  and in extreme cases  debarment from government contracting  denial of export privileges and criminal sanctions  any of which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
the department of state and us attorney inquiries may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses 
we cannot predict how long it will take or how much more time and resources it will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries  nor can we predict the outcome of these inquiries 
in connection with a review of our compliance with applicable export regulations in late  we discovered that we had made certain deemed exports to foreign national employees with respect to certain of its commercial products without the necessary deemed export licenses or license exemptions under the export administration regulations  or ear 
accordingly  we filed a detailed voluntary disclosure with the united states department of commerce describing these deemed export violations 
in june  we received notification from the department of commerce that it had completed its investigation into the matter with the issuance of a warning letter

business overview we are a leading provider of optical subsystems and components that connect local area networks  or lans  storage area networks  or sans  and metropolitan area networks  or mans and wide area networks  or wans 
our optical subsystems consist primarily of transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders which provide the fundamental optical electrical interface for connecting the equipment used in building these networks 
these products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers in conjunction with integrated circuit design and novel packaging technology to provide a cost effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable using a wide range of network protocols  transmission speeds and physical configurations over distances from meters up to kilometers 
we supply optical transceivers and transponders that allow point to point communications on a fiber using a single specified wavelength or  bundled with multiplexing technologies  can be used to supply multi gigabit bandwidth over several wavelengths on the same fiber 
we also provide products for dynamically switching network traffic from one optical link to another across multiple wavelengths without first converting to an electrical signal known as reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers  or roadms 
our line of 
table of contents optical components consists primarily of packaged lasers and photodetectors used in transceivers  primarily for lan and san applications and passive optical components used in building mans 
our manufacturing operations are vertically integrated  and we utilize internal sources for many of the key components used in making our products  including lasers  photodetectors and ics designed by our internal ic engineering teams 
we sell our optical subsystem and component products to manufacturers of storage and networking equipment such as alcatel lucent  brocade  cisco systems  emc  emulex  ericsson  hewlett packard company  huawei  ibm  juniper  qlogic  siemens and tellabs 
historically  we have also provided network performance test systems through our network tools division  primarily to original equipment manufacturers such as brocade  emc  emulex  hewlett packard company and qlogic for testing and validating equipment designs 
since october  we have completed the acquisition of ten privately held companies and certain businesses and assets from six other companies in order to broaden our product offerings and provide new sources of revenue  production capabilities and access to advanced technologies that we believe will enable us to reduce our product costs and develop innovative and more highly integrated product platforms while accelerating the timeframe required to develop such products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we allocate revenue to the separate elements based upon each element s fair value as determined by the list price for such element 
we sell our products through our direct sales force  with the support of our manufacturers representatives  directly to domestic customers and indirectly through distribution channels to international customers 
the evaluation and qualification cycle prior to the initial sale for our optical subsystems may span a year or more  while the sales cycle for our network performance test systems is usually considerably shorter 
the market for optical subsystems and components is characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from factors such as industry over capacity  increased competition  the introduction of new products and the growth in unit volumes as manufacturers continue to deploy network and storage systems 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decrease in future periods  although the timing and amount of these decreases cannot be predicted with any certainty 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead  warranty expense  inventory adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory and the amortization of acquired developed technology associated with acquisitions that we have made 
we manufacture our optical subsystem products at our subsidiary in ipoh  malaysia 
we manufacture vcsels used in our lan san products at our facility in allen  texas 
we manufacture long wavelength fp and certain dfb lasers used in our man and telecom products at our facility in fremont  california 
we manufacture certain passive components used in our man and telecom products at our facility in shanghai  china 
we assemble and test our roadm products at our facility in waterloo  australia 
we conduct manufacturing engineering  supply chain management  quality assurance and documentation control at our facility in sunnyvale  california 
as a result of building a vertically integrated business model  our manufacturing cost structure has become more fixed 
while this can be beneficial during periods when demand is strong  it can be more difficult to reduce costs during periods when demand for our products is weak  product mix is unfavorable or selling prices are generally lower 
while we have undertaken measures to reduce our operating costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our cost of revenues enough to achieve or sustain profitability 
our gross profit margins vary among our product families  and have generally been higher on our network test systems than on our optical subsystems and components 
our optical products sold for longer distance man and telecom applications typically have higher gross margins than our products for shorter distance lan and san applications 
our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of overall revenue levels  shifts in product mix  the introduction of new products  decreases in average selling prices and our ability to reduce product costs 

table of contents research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel  the cost of developing prototypes and fees paid to consultants 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our long term success 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions paid to manufacturers representatives  salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and field support activities and other costs associated with the promotion of our products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
acquired in process research and development represents the amount of the purchase price in a business combination allocated to research and development projects underway at the acquired company that had not reached the technologically feasible stage as of the closing of the acquisition and for which we had no alternative future use 
a portion of the purchase price in a business combination is allocated to goodwill and intangibles 
prior to may   goodwill and purchased intangibles were amortized over their estimated useful lives 
subsequent to may   goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the cost of definite lived intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic life 
impairment charges consist of write downs of the carrying value of certain intangible assets and goodwill arising from various business combinations to their fair value 
restructuring costs generally include termination costs for employees associated with a formal restructuring plan and the cost of facilities or other unusable assets abandoned or sold 
other income and expenses generally consist of bank fees  gains or losses as a result of the periodic sale of assets and other than temporary decline in the value of investments 
combination with optium corporation on august   we completed a business combination with optium corporation  a leading designer and manufacturer of high performance optical subsystems for use in telecommunications and catv network systems  through the merger of optium with a wholly owned subsidiary of finisar 
we believe that the combination of the two companies created the world s largest supplier of optical components  modules and subsystems for the communications industry and will leverage the finisar s leadership position in the storage and data networking sectors of the industry and optium s leadership position in the telecommunications and catv sectors to create a more competitive industry participant 
in addition  as a result of the combination  we expect to realize cost synergies related to operating expenses and manufacturing costs resulting from the transfer of production to lower cost locations  improved purchasing power associated with being a larger company and cost synergies associated with the integration of components into product designs previously purchased in the open market by optium 
we have accounted for the combination using the purchase method of accounting and as a result have included the operating results of optium in our consolidated financial results since the august  consummation date 
at the closing of the merger  we issued  shares of finisar common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of optium 
the value of the shares issued was calculated using the five day average of the closing price of the company s common stock from the second trading day before the merger announcement date on may  through the second trading day following the announcement  or per share 
the optium results are included in our optical subsystems and components segment 
pending sale of network performance test systems business on july   we entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our network tools division excluding accounts receivable and payable to jdsu for million in cash 
jdsu will assume certain liability associated 
table of contents with the network performance test business  and we will provide manufacturing support services to jdsu during a transition period 
the sale is expected to be completed on or about july  following the completion of the sale  we will no longer offer network performance test products 
these products accounted for million  million and million in revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit and operating profit margins on sales of network performance test products have generally been higher than on our optical subsystem and component products 
accordingly  we expect that our revenues and profitability will be adversely affected following the sale unless and until we are able to achieve significant growth in our optical subsystems and components business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures require that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue and operating results  as well as on the value of certain assets  contingent assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of other significant accounting policies 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the fiscal year ended april  compared to prior years 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas r 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended after april  includes compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  the adoption of sfas r  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas and compensation expense for stock based payment awards granted subsequent to april  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards that were granted on or prior to april  was valued under the multiple option approach and will continue to be amortized using the accelerated attribution method 
subsequent to april   compensation expense for expected to vest stock based awards is valued under the single option approach and amortized on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures 
revenue recognition  warranty and sales returns our revenue recognition policy follows sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
specifically  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for those arrangements with multiple elements  or in related arrangements with the same customer  the arrangement is divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
for units of accounting which include more than one deliverable  we generally recognize all revenue and cost of revenue for the unit of accounting over the period in which the last undelivered item is delivered 

table of contents at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
our standard warranty period usually extends months from the date of sale although it can extend for longer periods of three to five years for certain products sold to certain customers 
our warranty accrual represents our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what actually transpire in the future 
if our actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  costs of revenue will increase in the future 
we also provide an allowance for estimated customer returns  which is netted against revenue 
this provision is based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
if the historical data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where  subsequent to delivery  we become aware of a customer s potential inability to meet its obligations  we record a specific allowance for the doubtful account to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
a material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could result in a material reduction in the estimated amount of accounts receivable that can ultimately be collected and an increase in our general and administrative expenses for the shortfall 
slow moving and obsolete inventories we make inventory commitment and purchase decisions based upon sales forecasts 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past and to fill orders with non standard configurations  we build inventory levels for certain items with long lead times and enter into certain longer term commitments for certain items 
we permanently write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
we periodically discard obsolete inventory 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory levels 
we use a month demand forecast  and in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be engineered out of our products  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
significant differences between our estimates and judgments regarding future timing of product transitions  volume and mix of customer demand for our products and actual timing  volume and demand mix may result in additional write offs in the future  or additional usage of previously written off inventory in future periods for which we would benefit from a reduced cost of revenues in those future periods 
investment in equity securities for strategic reasons  we may make minority investments in private or public companies or extend loans or receive equity or debt from these companies for services rendered or assets sold 
our minority investments in private companies are primarily motivated by our desire to gain early access to new technology 
our investments in these companies are passive in nature in that we generally do not obtain representation on the boards of directors 
our investments have generally been part of a larger financing in which the terms were negotiated by other investors  typically venture capital investors 
these investments are generally made in exchange for preferred stock with a liquidation preference that helps protect the underlying value of our investment 
at the time we made our 
table of contents investments  in most cases the companies had not completed development of their products and we did not enter into any significant supply agreements with the companies in which we invested 
in determining if and when a decline in the market value of these investments below their carrying value is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings and cash flows  price multiples  prospects for liquidity and other key measures of performance 
our policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists  such as a the completion of a new equity financing that may indicate a new value for the investment  b the failure to complete a new equity financing arrangement after seeking to raise additional funds or c the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders 
as of april   the carrying value of these investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results at any of the companies in which we hold a minority position could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of these investments 
restructuring accrual liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we consolidated our sunnyvale facilities into one building and permanently exited a portion of our scotts valley facility 
as a result of these activities  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these restructuring charges included  of miscellaneous costs required to effect the closures and approximately million of non cancelable facility lease payments 
of the million in restructuring charges  million related to our optical subsystems and components segment and million related to our network performance test systems segment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million for the remaining portion of the scotts valley facility that had been used for a product of our network performance test systems segment which was sold in first quarter of fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the sale of product line 
the facilities consolidation charges were calculated using estimates that were based upon the remaining future lease commitments for vacated facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate sources

in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
we operate two reporting units  optical subsystems and components and network performance test systems 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment is then measured in the second step in which 
we determine the implied value of goodwill based on the allocation of the estimated fair value determined in the initial step to all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 

table of contents we are required to make judgments about the recoverability of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired or not recoverable 
in order to make such judgments  we are required to make assumptions about the value of these assets in the future including future prospects for earnings and cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we write those assets down to their fair value which is generally determined based on discounted cash flows 
judgments and assumptions about the future are complex  subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including industry and economic trends  our market position and the competitive environment of the businesses in which we operate 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and their reported amounts  along with net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we provide for income taxes based upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for the undistributed earnings of non united states subsidiaries

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the number of shares to be exchanged in the optium merger was fixed at shares of our common stock for each share of optium common stock 
the closing price of our common stock on may  was  while a five day average used to calculate the consideration paid in the merger was 
the preliminary allocation of the merger consideration resulted in the recognition of an additional million of goodwill which  when combined with the million goodwill acquired prior to the merger  resulted in total goodwill of approximately million 
the actual operating results and outlook for both companies between the date of the definitive agreement and the effective date of the merger had not changed to any significant degree  with both companies separately reporting record revenues for their interim quarters 
between the effective date of the merger and november   the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
among these indicators were a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment largely caused by the widespread unavailability of business and consumer credit  a significant decrease in our market capitalization as a result of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock to at the end of the quarter and a decrease in internal expectations for near term revenues  especially those expected to result from the optium merger 
for purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair value were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
as of the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the second quarter of fiscal  we had not completed our analysis due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill for the optical subsystems and components reporting unit  which is based on the determination of the fair value of all assets and liabilities of this reporting unit 
however  based on the work performed through the date of the filing  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge  representing our best estimate of the impairment loss during the second quarter of fiscal while finalizing our impairment analysis during the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that there were additional indicators sufficient to require another interim goodwill impairment analysis 
among these indicators were a worsening of the macroeconomic environment largely caused by the unavailability of business and consumer credit  an additional decrease in our market capitalization as a result of a decrease in the trading price of our common stock to at the end of the quarter and a further decrease in internal expectations for near term revenues 
for purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair value were again based on a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
as of the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of fiscal  we had not completed our analysis due to the complexities involved in determining the implied fair value of the goodwill for the optical subsystems and components reporting unit  which is based on the determination of the fair value of all assets and liabilities of this reporting unit 
however  based on the work performed through the date of the filing  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  we recorded an additional million non cash goodwill impairment charge  representing our best estimate of the impairment loss during the third quarter of fiscal as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed the required annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that the remaining balance of goodwill of

other income expense  net 
other expense was million in fiscal compared to other income of million in fiscal the increase in other expense in fiscal was primarily due to unrealized non cash charges of million related to the re measurement of foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and payable on the books of a subsidiary  a loss of million on disposal of fixed assets  a loss of million on impairment of an investment in equity security and an increase of  in realized foreign currency losses 
provision for income taxes

if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we place our investments with high credit issuers in short term securities with maturities ranging from overnight up to months or have characteristics of such short term investments 
the average maturity of the portfolio will not exceed months 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and  therefore  our investments are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we sold most of our investments during fiscal to meet our working capital requirements and other debt obligations 
at april   our investments exposing us to interest rate risk were only  as compared to million at april  
table of contents the following table summarizes the expected maturity  average interest rate and fair market value of the available for sale debt securities held by us and related receivables and debt securities issued by us as of april  in thousands fiscal years ended april  fair and market thereafter total cost value assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt fixed rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate the following table summarizes the expected maturity  average interest rate and fair market value of the available for sale debt securities held by us and related receivables and debt securities issued by us as of april  in thousands fiscal years ended april  fair and market thereafter total cost value assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt fixed rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when our ownership interest is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
at april   we had investments in four privately held companies that totaled million and were accounted for under the cost method 
for entities in which we hold greater than a ownership interest  or where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  we use the equity method  we held no such investments at april  we recorded losses of in fiscal  in fiscal and  in fiscal  for investments accounted for under the equity method 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired 
there were no impairment losses on these assets during fiscal  or if our investment in a privately held company becomes marketable equity securities upon the company s completion of an initial public offering or its acquisition by another company  our investment would be subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
we have subsidiaries located in china  malaysia  europe  israel  australia and singapore 
due to the relative volume of transactions through these subsidiaries  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to foreign 
table of contents currency exchange risks 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure 
in july  china and malaysia changed the system by which the value of their currencies are determined 
both currencies moved from a fixed rate pegged to the us dollar to a managed float pegged to a basket of currencies 
we expect that this will have a minor negative impact on our future costs 
we continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency forwards or options in future years
