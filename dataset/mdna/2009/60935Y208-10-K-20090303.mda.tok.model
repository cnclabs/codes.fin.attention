we recognized a loss from discontinued operations of million in the consolidated statements of loss income in  representing the recognition of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance partially offset by the reversal of the remaining liability for contingencies which expired 
the following discussion of our results of operations is focused on our continuing businesses 

table of contents significant actions and developments following is a summary of significant actions taken by the company in and economic developments during the year that impacted our consolidated financial statements portfolio realignment and losses in the second half of  the asset backed securities and general credit markets experienced unprecedented deterioration due to increasing concerns over defaults on mortgages and debt in general 
this deterioration caused ratings downgrades and market demands for higher risk premiums and liquidity discounts on asset backed securities  resulting in substantial declines in the fair value of asset backed securities 
the markets continued to deteriorate in  resulting in additional losses in our investment portfolio beyond those recognized in we completed a plan during the first quarter of to realign our investment portfolio away from asset backed securities and into highly liquid assets through the sale of a substantial portion of our available for sale portfolio 
as a result of this plan  we sold securities with a fair value of billion after other than temporary impairment charges as of december  for a net realized loss of million 
the realized loss was due to further market deterioration subsequent to the december  valuation and the short timeframe over which we sold the investments 
proceeds from the sales of billion were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents 
after the realignment  our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of cash  cash equivalents and agency securities or securities backed solely by agency securities 
as we no longer have the intent to hold our remaining investments classified in other asset backed securities  we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million in from the continued deterioration in the markets over increasing mortgage defaults and illiquidity and uncertainty concerns 
while the realigned portfolio will significantly reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the fair value of our investments and greatly enhance our liquidity  it has resulted in lower investment yields than we have historically earned 
capital transaction we completed a capital transaction on march  pursuant to which we received billion of gross equity and debt capital to support the long term needs of the business and to provide necessary capital due to the investment portfolio losses the capital transaction 
in completing the capital transaction  we anticipated the further deterioration of our investments classified in other asset backed securities and trading investments 
as a result  the proceeds from the capital transaction cover the investment losses recognized in by the company for these investments and no further capital needs are anticipated as of the date of this filing 
the equity component of the capital transaction consisted of a million private placement of participating convertible preferred stock the series b stock 
the debt component consisted of the issuance of million of senior secured second lien notes the notes with a year maturity 
additionally  we entered into a senior secured amended and restated credit agreement the senior facility  amending our existing million debt facility to increase the facility by million to a total facility size of million 
the new facility includes million in two term loan tranches and a million revolving credit facility 
we have availability under the revolving facility of million at december  for a description of the terms of the equity and debt components of the capital transaction  see liquidity and capital resources impact of the credit market disruption and note mezzanine equity and note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the net proceeds of the capital transaction were invested in cash equivalents to supplement our unrestricted assets 
official check restructuring and repricing in the first quarter of  we initiated the restructuring of our official check business by changing the commission structure and exiting certain large customer relationships 
as of december   we have termination agreements with the majority of our top financial institution customers and expect to exit the remaining top customers upon the expiration of their service contracts 
as of december   approximately billion of balances for the top customers have run off  with the remaining balances expected to run off over the next six to months as the customers cease issuing new official checks and old issuances are presented to us for payment 
effective june  for most customers and july  for our remaining customers  we reduced the commission rate paid to the majority of our official check financial institution customers 
this repricing results in an average contractual payout rate of the effective federal funds rate less approximately basis points 
see significant actions and developments interest rate environment and results of operations table net investment revenue analysis for discussion regarding the impact of the restructuring and repricing initiatives on our investment revenue and investment commissions 

table of contents money order repricing and review in the fourth quarter of  we initiated the first phase of a repricing initiative for our money order product sold through retail agent locations 
this initiative increases the per item fee we receive for our money orders and reflects the impact of the realigned investment portfolio on the profitability of this product 
we are assessing the impact of this first phase and may roll out additional pricing initiatives in on a targeted basis 
in addition  we continue to review our credit exposure to our agents and may terminate or otherwise revise our relationship with certain agents 
we expect volumes to decline from the attrition of money order customers as a result of these initiatives 
interest rate environment the interest rate environment was volatile during  with the effective federal funds rate  libor  the us prime rate and the us treasury rate declining to historical lows 
the following table shows the movement in interest rates affecting our operating results december  september  june  march  december  fed funds effective rate month libor us prime rate year us treasury rate interest rates affect our business in several ways  but primarily through investment revenue  investment commission expense and interest expense 
first  the majority of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents is floating rate  causing investment revenue to decrease when rates decline and increase when rates rise 
second  the commissions we pay to our official check financial institution customers are variable rate and primarily based on the effective federal funds rate 
accordingly  our investment commissions expense decreases when rates decline and increases when rates rise 
as discussed in results of operations table net investment revenue analysis  our net investment margin is based on the spread between the yield earned on our investment portfolio and the commission rates paid to our official check customers 
in a declining federal funds rate environment  our net investment margin will typically be benefited  while an increasing federal funds rate environment will typically have a negative impact on our net investment margin 
this is due to lag in when changes in interest rates impact the two components of the net investment margin  with commission rates resetting faster than our investment portfolio 
in the current environment  the federal funds rate is so low that most of our financial institution customers are in a negative commission position  in that we do not owe any commissions to our customers 
while the vast majority of our contracts require the financial institution customers to pay us for the negative commission amount  we have opted at this time to impose certain per item and other fees rather than require payment of the negative commissions amount 
we continue to monitor the negative commissions and may decide to pursue payment at a future date 
third  our senior facility is floating rate debt 
accordingly  our interest expense will decrease in a declining rate environment and increase when rates rise 
see expenses for further discussion regarding interest expense and liquidity and capital resources and note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our senior facility 
economic recession the global macroeconomic conditions deteriorated in  with many countries  including the united states  formally declaring during the fourth quarter that their economies were in a recession 
unemployment rates have significantly increased and it is generally believed that unemployment rates will increase further before showing improvement 
historically  the performance of the money remittance industry has been resilient during economic softness as money transfers are deemed essential to many  with the funds used by the receiving party for food  housing and other basic needs 
however  given the global economic uncertainty  we have less visibility to the future and believe growth rates could be impacted by slowing economic conditions 
in addition  bill payment products available in the us market may not be as resilient as money transfers given the more discretionary nature of some items paid for by consumers using these products 
we believe the current economic conditions negatively affected our growth in the fourth quarter of see outlook for for further discussion of expected impacts of the economic recession on our operating results 
executive management changes on june   we announced the departure of philip w 
milne  president and chief executive officer 
on january   the board of directors appointed anthony p 
ryan as president 
table of contents and chief executive officer and pamela h 
patsley as executive chairman of the board 
during the second quarter of  we hired lonnie keene as our new executive vp and chief compliance officer and during the third quarter of  we hired mubashar hameed as our new executive v 
p and chief information officer 
tax developments during  we evaluated various tax positions related to the net securities losses incurred in and in the fourth quarter of  the company completed the evaluation of the technical merits of tax positions with respect to part of the net securities losses and recorded a million tax benefit from the release of deferred tax valuation allowances relating to net securities losses in and based on the identified tax positions  we received a million income tax refund during and an additional million income tax refund in january as we assess changes in facts and circumstances in the future  we may record additional tax benefits as further deferred tax valuation allowances are released and carry forwards are utilized 
we continue to evaluate additional available tax positions related to the net securities losses 
results of operations components of net revenue our net revenue consists of fee and other revenue  investment revenue and net securities gains and losses  less commission expense 
we generate net revenue primarily by charging transaction fees in excess of third party agent commissions  managing foreign currency exchange and managing our investments to provide returns in excess of commissions paid to financial institution customers 
we derive revenue primarily through service fees charged to consumers and through our investments 
fee and other revenue consist of transaction fees  foreign exchange and miscellaneous revenue 
transaction fees are fees earned on the sale of money transfers  retail money order  bill payment products and official check transactions 
money transfer transaction fees are fixed per transaction and may vary based upon the face amount of the transaction  the originating location and the receiving location 
money order and bill payment transaction fees are fixed per transaction 
foreign exchange revenue is derived from the management of currency exchange spreads on international money transfer transactions 
miscellaneous revenue primarily consists of processing fees on rebate checks and controlled disbursements  service charges on aged outstanding money orders and money order dispenser fees 
investment revenue consists of interest and dividends generated through the investment of cash balances received from the sale of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments 
these cash balances are available to us for investment until the payment instrument is presented for payment 
investment revenue varies depending on the level of investment balances and the yield on our investments 
investment balances vary based on the number of payment instruments sold  the average face amount of those payment instruments and the average length of time that passes until the instruments are presented for payment 
net securities gains and losses consist of realized gains and losses on the sale of investments  other than temporary impairments of investments and unrealized gains and losses on trading investments 
we incur fee commission expense on our money transfer products 
in a money transfer transaction  both the agent initiating the transaction and the agent disbursing the funds receive a commission that is generally based on a percentage of the fee charged to the consumer 
we generally do not pay commissions to agents on the sale of money orders 
in certain limited circumstances for large agents  we may pay a fixed commission amount based on money order volumes transacted by that agent 
fee commissions also include the amortization of capitalized signing bonus payments to agents 
investment commission expense consists of amounts paid to financial institution customers of the payment systems segment based on the average outstanding cash balances generated by the sale of official checks 
commissions paid to financial institution customers generally are variable based on short term interest rates 
prior to the third quarter of  investment commissions included costs associated with interest rate swaps and the sale of receivables program 
we historically used interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our variable rate commission payments to fixed rate payments  which hedged the interest rate risk associated with the variable rate commissions paid to our financial institution customers 
in connection with the interest rate swaps  we paid a fixed amount to a counterparty and received a variable rate payment in return 
to the extent that the fixed rate exceeded the variable rate  we incurred an expense related to the swap  conversely  if the variable rate exceeded the fixed rate  we received income 
table of contents related to the swap 
in connection with our restructuring of the official check business initiated in the first quarter of  we terminated certain financial institution customer relationships 
as a result  we terminated the swaps related to commission payments in june see further discussion of the termination of these swaps in note derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
under our sale of receivables program  we historically sold certain of our agent receivables at a discount to accelerate our cash flow  this discount was recorded as an expense 
in january  we terminated our sale of receivable program and ceased selling receivables by march see further discussion on our sale of receivables program in note summary of significant accounting policies sale of receivables of the notes to consolidated financial statements

while simplified pricing initiatives have contributed to a lower average per transaction fee  we believe that the initiatives have contributed to our volume growth for money transfer as simpler pricing and lower overall fees attract new customers 
during  the gap between total revenue growth and money transfer transaction growth narrowed primarily because we lapped the first full year of implementation of simplified pricing initiatives

unrealized losses from our trading investments is comprised of a million decline in the value of our trading investments  partially offset by a million unrealized gain relating to put options received in the fourth quarter of relating to the trading investments 
the other than temporary impairments and unrealized losses are the result of continued deterioration in the mortgage markets  as well as increasing illiquidity and uncertainty in the broader markets 
in december  two of our three auction rate securities classified as trading investments had the embedded preferred put option exercised 
as a result of the embedded preferred put option being exercised  one trading security is now a perpetual preferred stock while the other security is now collateralized by perpetual preferred stock 
these actions resulted in a decline in fair value as preferred stock is viewed as less liquid and the discretionary income streams are more uncertain

we continue to evaluate additional available tax positions related to the net securities losses 
for  we had an effective tax rate of negative percent as compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate in was due to establishing a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million relating primarily to investment losses in due to the amount and characterization of these losses  as of december   we determined that it was not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to the losses would be realized

we also provide money orders and bill payment services to consumers through the us network of agents and  in select markets  company operated locations 
fee revenue is driven by transaction volume and fees per transaction 
in addition  investment income is generated by investing funds received from the sale of retail money orders until the instruments are settled 
payment systems this segment provides financial institutions in the united states with payment processing services  primarily official check outsourcing services  and money orders for sale to their customers 
this segment also processes controlled disbursements 
investment income is generated by investing funds received from the sale of payment instruments until the instruments are settled 
in addition  fee revenue is derived from per item fees paid by our financial institution customers 
the business segments are determined based upon factors such as the type of customers  the nature of products and services provided and the distribution channels used to provide those services 
segment pre tax operating income and segment operating margin are used to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
we manage our investment portfolio on a consolidated level  with no specific investment security assigned to a particular segment

investment revenue and net securities gains 
table of contents losses are allocated based upon the allocation of average investable balances 
our derivatives portfolio is also managed on a consolidated level  however  each derivative instrument is utilized in a manner that can be identified to a particular segment

money transfer including bill payment fee and other revenue including bill payment grew million  or percent  in  driven by money transfer transaction volume growth of percent 
this growth is the result of our network expansion and continued targeted pricing initiatives to provide a strong consumer value proposition  supported by targeted marketing efforts

our targeted pricing initiatives  which were initiated in the first half of  included reducing the number of pricing tiers or bands  allowing us to manage our price volume dynamic while streamlining the point of sale process for our agents and customers 
while targeted pricing initiatives have contributed to a lower average per transaction fee  we believe that the initiatives have contributed to our volume growth for money transfer as a simpler pricing process and lower overall fees attracts new customers 
we continue to evaluate the price volume dynamic and will make further changes where deemed appropriate to support our consumer value proposition 
in january  we launched our moneygram rewards loyalty program in the united states  which provides tiered discounts on transaction fees to our repeat consumers  less paperwork and notifications to the sender when the funds are received  among other features 
we believe this program contributed to the strong domestic transaction growth  attracting both new and repeat consumers 
we intend to roll out a loyalty program in canada and select european markets in  as well as make revisions to the existing program to further enhance its attractiveness to consumers

in the fourth quarter of  we implemented the first phase of a repricing initiative and undertook a review of the risk versus reward for our money order only agents

partially offsetting these factors was a benefit from higher yields earned on our cash investments and adjustable rate securities due to the disruption in the credit markets in the second half of see results of operations table net investment revenue analysis for further information regarding average investable balances and yields on the consolidated investment portfolio 
commissions expense increased percent in  primarily driven by tiered commission rates paid to certain agents and increases in the euro exchange rate 
tiered commissions are commission rates that are adjusted upward  subject to certain caps  as an agent s transaction volume grows 
we use tiered commission rates as an incentive for select agents to grow transaction volume by paying the agents for performance and allowing the agent to participate in adding market share for moneygram

outlook for our outlook for is based on information presently available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
differences in actual economic conditions during compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
see cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k for additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those contemplated by the following forward looking statements 
worldwide economic conditions began deteriorating significantly in  with many countries  including the united states  formally announcing that their economies were in a recession 
the deterioration in the global economy is evidenced by many factors  including increasing unemployment  substantial government assistance to citizens and certain industries  significant declines in asset values  increasing rates of consumer defaults and corporate bankruptcies and decreased consumer confidence and spending 
we cannot predict the duration or extent of severity of this economic downturn  nor the extent to which these global economic developments could negatively affect our business  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents while the money remittance industry has generally been resilient during times of economic softness  the current global economic deterioration has begun to adversely impact the demand for money remittances 
the world bank  a key source of industry analysis for developing countries  projects a decline of approximately one percent to six percent in the face value of remittances in this is consistent with our expectation that money transfer volumes in will be lower than those experienced in while we are unable to predict when the global economy and the remittance industry will begin to improve  the world bank is projecting remittance growth in of approximately one percent to six percent 
for our us based retail money order business  we expect the decline in overall paper based transactions to continue in the company has million of goodwill allocated to its retail money order business 
in completing our assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that this goodwill is not impaired based on our estimates for if actual operating results in are worse than these estimates  we may need to recognize an impairment of the goodwill assigned to this business 
in our official check business  we expect our net investment margin to decline given the current interest rate environment 
as described in significant actions and developments interest rate environment  the effective federal funds rate dropped so low in late that commissions to most of our financial institution customers were negative at the end of the year 
accordingly  we do not expect any further benefit to commissions expense in the interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalents are expected to decline further in the current rate environment  which would cause our investment margin to decline in any increase in interest rates in will also negatively impact our margin due to the lagging impact of rising rates on our investment portfolio 
we continue to see a trend among state  federal and international regulators toward enhanced scrutiny of anti money laundering compliance 
in addition  the european union has adopted the european commissions payment services directive  which creates a new licensing and regulatory framework for our services in the european union 
as we continue to add staff resources and enhancements to our technology systems to address the regulatory trend and the payment services directive  our operating expenses related to regulatory compliance will likely increase

capital transaction on march   we completed the capital transaction  pursuant to which we received an infusion of billion of gross equity and debt capital to support the long term needs of the business and provide necessary capital due to the investment portfolio losses in late and the first quarter of the net proceeds of the capital transaction were used to invest in cash equivalents to supplement our unrestricted assets and to repay million on our revolving credit facility 
following are the key terms of the equity and debt capital issued 
equity capital the equity component of the capital transaction consisted of the private placement of  shares  in aggregate  of series b participating convertible preferred stock the b stock and shares of non voting series b participating convertible preferred stock the b stock collectively  the series b stock to affiliates of thl and affiliates of goldman sachs  respectively  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
after the issuance of the series b stock  the investors had an equity interest of approximately percent  this equity interest has increased to percent as of december  from the accrual of dividends during the year 
in connection with the capital transaction  we also paid goldman sachs an investment banking advisory fee equal to million in the form of  shares of b stock 
the series b stock pays a cash dividend of percent 
at our option  we may accrue dividends at a rate of percent in lieu of paying a cash dividend 
dividends may be accrued for up to five years from the date of the capital transaction 
after five years  if we choose to not pay the dividends in cash  dividends will accrue at a rate of percent 
the series b 
table of contents stock participates in dividends with the common stock on an as converted basis 
due to restrictions in our debt agreements  we accrued rather than paid the dividends on the series b stock through december  the b stock is convertible into shares of common stock of the company at a price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the b stock is convertible into b stock by any stockholder other than goldman sachs 
while held by goldman sachs  the b stock is convertible into series d participating convertible preferred stock  which is a non voting common equivalent stock which is convertible into shares of common stock 
the value of the series b stock to be converted upon election is equal to the par value of the stock plus any unpaid and accrued dividends 
the series b stock may be redeemed at the option of the company if  after five years from the date of the capital transaction  the common stock trades above  subject to adjustment  for a period of thirty consecutive trading days 
the series b stock will be redeemable at the option of the investors after years and upon a change in control 
the b stock votes as a class with the common stock and has a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable if all outstanding shares of b stock were converted plus the number of shares of common stock issuable if all outstanding shares of b stock were converted into b stock and subsequently converted into common stock 
see note mezzanine equity of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the series b stock  including the amendment of the rights agreement with wells fargo bank  na as rights agent and the registration rights agreement entered into with the investors 
included in the series b stock described above are conversion and change of control redemption options which are considered embedded derivatives 
during the first half of  until an agreement was entered into with the investors  these embedded derivatives were required to be bifurcated and accounted for at fair value separately from the series b stock 
the fair value of these embedded derivatives was remeasured each period  with changes recognized in the consolidated statements of loss income 
the increase in the fair value of the liability of million for  was recognized in the valuation loss on embedded derivatives line in the consolidated statements of loss income 
the changes in fair value were principally driven by movements in the price of our common stock  the volatility of our common stock and credit spreads  and should generally move directionally with changes in the price of our common stock 
the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are non cash gains losses which do not impact our liquidity or contractual and regulatory measures or requirements 
in august  the investors and the company entered into an agreement that explicitly clarifies that the investors may not require us to net cash settle the conversion option if we do not have sufficient shares of common stock to effect a conversion 
effective with this agreement  the series b stock conversion option no longer meets the criteria for an embedded derivative requiring liability accounting treatment 
as a result of this agreement  the related liability was reversed to additional paid in capital in the third quarter of and no further remeasurement will be required 
see note derivative financial instruments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the embedded derivatives 
senior credit facility as part of the capital transaction  our wholly owned subsidiary moneygram payment systems worldwide  inc worldwide entered into a senior credit facility the senior facility of million with various lenders and jpmorgan chase bank  n 
a jpmorgan  as administrative agent for the lenders 
the senior facility amended and restated the million amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of june   among the company and a group of lenders and includes an additional million term loan 
in connection with this transaction  we terminated our million day credit agreement with jpmorgan 
the senior facility is comprised of a million tranche a term loan tranche a  a million tranche b term loan tranche b and a million revolving credit facility 
tranche b was issued at a discount of percent  or million 
the interest rate applicable to tranche a and the revolving credit facility is the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
the interest rate applicable to tranche b is the eurodollar rate plus basis points 
the maturity date of the senior facility is march fees on the daily unused availability under the revolving credit facility are basis points 
there is a prepayment premium on the tranche b term loan of two percent during the first year and one percent during the second year of the senior facility 
loans under the senior facility are secured by substantially all our non financial assets 
borrowings under the senior facility are subject to various covenants  including limitations on use of proceeds from borrowings under the senior facility  additional indebtedness  mergers and consolidations  sales of assets  dividends and other restricted payments  investments  loans and advances and transactions with affiliates 
the 
table of contents senior facility also has certain financial covenants  including an interest coverage ratio and a senior secured debt ratio  with compliance required beginning in the fiscal quarter ending march  under the senior facility  we must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of from march  through september   from december  through september   and from december  through maturity 
we are not permitted to have a senior secured debt ratio in excess of from march  through september   from december  through september   from december  through september   from december  through september   and from december  through maturity 
the senior facility also contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain at least a ratio of certain assets to outstanding payment service obligations 
see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the senior facility 
second lien notes as part of our capital transaction  our wholly owned subsidiary worldwide issued million of senior secured second lien notes the notes maturing in march to goldman sachs 
the interest rate on the notes is percent per year unless interest is capitalized  in which case the interest rate increases to percent 
prior to march   we have the option to capitalize interest of percent  but must pay in cash percent of the interest payable 
we paid the interest through december  and anticipate that we will continue to pay the interest under this option 
we can redeem the notes after five years at specified premiums 
prior to the fifth anniversary  we may redeem some or all of the notes at a price equal to percent of the outstanding principal at that date plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  plus a premium equal to the greater of one percent or an amount calculated by discounting the sum of a the redemption payment that would be due upon the fifth anniversary plus b all required interest payments due through such fifth anniversary using the treasury rate plus basis points 
upon a change of control  we are required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest

the covenants also substantially restrict our ability to incur additional debt  create or incur liens and invest assets that are subject to restrictions for the payment of payment service obligations 
we are also required to maintain at least a ratio of certain assets to outstanding payment service obligations 
see note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the notes 
liquidity and capital resources we have various resources available to us for purposes of managing liquidity and capital needs  including our cash  cash equivalents  investments  credit facilities and letters of credit 
we refer to our cash equivalents  trading investments and available for sale investments collectively as our investment portfolio  with cash equivalents comprising our short term portfolio  and trading investments and available for sale investments comprising our long term portfolio 
the short term portfolio is used in managing our daily operating liquidity needs 
liquidity we utilize our cash and cash equivalents as the main tools to manage our daily operating liquidity needs 
our primary operating liquidity need relates to the monies required to settle our payment instruments and related fees and commissions on a daily basis 
our second primary operating liquidity need relates to the funding of the routine operating activities of the business 
to meet these needs  we must have sufficient highly liquid assets to meet our obligations at all times and be able to move funds on a global and timely basis 
we also have a primary objective to maintain excess liquidity beyond our operating needs to provide cushion through the normal fluctuations in  and timing of  our payment service assets and liabilities  as well as to provide liquidity for the investment in the infrastructure and growth of the business 

table of contents on average  we pay approximately billion a day to settle our payment instruments and make related settlements with our agents and financial institutions 
we generally receive a similar amount on a daily basis from our agents and financial institutions for the face amount and related fees of our payment instruments sold 
we use the in coming funds from sales of new payment instruments to settle previously sold payment instruments that are presented for payment 
in simple terms  the face amount of an instrument sold today is used to settle the face amount of an instrument sold yesterday and presented for payment today 
this pattern of cash flows allows us to settle our payment instruments without the need for short term financing or routine divesting from our long term portfolio 
if sales of new payment instruments declined faster than the settlement of outstanding instruments  we would need to utilize our short term portfolio to fund the settlement of payment instruments  and in a worst case scenario  would need to sell from our long term portfolio 
our daily net cash settlements tend to follow a pattern whereby certain days of the week are typically net cash inflow days  while other days are typically net cash outflow days 
on the days with a net cash outflow  we utilize our cash equivalents to fund the shortfall 
on the net cash inflow day  excess cash is reinvested in cash equivalents 
the timely remittance of funds by our agents and financial institution customers is an important component of our liquidity and allows for the pattern of cash flows described above 
if the timing of the remittance of funds to us deteriorated  it would alter our pattern of cash flows and could require us to utilize our short term portfolio for settlements with our agents more frequently 
in the current economic conditions  there is a higher risk that the timing of remittances to us could lengthen or that an agent or financial institution customer could default on its remittance obligations 
we are managing this risk by closely monitoring the remit patterns of our agents and financial institution customers and acting quickly when we detect deterioration in remittance timing or an alteration in payment patterns 
options available to us include the ability to deactivate an agent or financial institution customer s equipment at any time  thereby not allowing them to initiate further money transfers or issue further instruments 
see enterprise risk management credit risk for further discussion of this risk and our actions to mitigate 
the in coming cash flows related to fees paid by our consumers and income earned on our investment portfolio provide the funds for commission payments to our agents and financial institutions  as well as our operating and capital expenditure cash needs 
substantially all of our commission payments and a significant amount of our operating expenses are tied to transaction volumes 
if transaction volumes and the related fee revenue declined  our commission payment needs would decline approximately in tandem 
operating expenses would also decline  but not at the same rate or in the same amount as fee revenue 
to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs at all times  including during the current economic recession  we keep a significant portion of our portfolio in cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   percent of our investment portfolio is comprised of cash and cash equivalents 
as shown in table unrestricted assets below  we have unrestricted assets of million 
these assets would be available to us for purposes of investment in the infrastructure and growth of our business  however  we consider a portion of our unrestricted assets as additional assurance that regulatory and contractual requirements are maintained through the normal fluctuations of our payment service assets and obligations 
we believe that we have sufficient assets and liquidity to operate and grow our business for the next months 
should our liquidity needs exceed our operating cash flows  we believe that our external financing sources  including availability under the senior facility  will be sufficient to meet any shortfalls 
depending on market conditions and prices  our financial liquidity and other factors  and subject to limitations contained in our credit agreement and indenture  we may seek from time to time to repurchase our notes and our common stock in open market purchases  privately negotiated purchases or otherwise  and we may seek to repay all or part of our senior facility 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings 
we move and receive money through a network of clearing and cash management banks 
the relationships with these clearing banks and cash management banks are a critical component of our ability to move monies on a global and timely basis 
we have agreements with clearing banks that provide clearing and processing functions for official checks  money orders and share drafts  with two of these banks expected to be consolidated in due to an acquisition 
due to concerns over the impact of the credit market disruption on our business  we agreed with certain of our clearing banks to make funding changes  including providing additional intra day funding  during the 
table of contents first quarter of these changes reduce the clearing banks exposure if we were unable to settle our obligations with them 
at no time in the past or in have we failed to settle with our clearing banks in full 
as the credit market disruption continued to deteriorate in  financial institutions in general began to reduce their credit exposure to preserve their capital base 
three banks that clear official checks gave us notice in that they will not renew their clearing agreements when those agreements expire in mid the loss of our clearing arrangements with these three clearing banks has not had an adverse effect on our official check business as we are moving the impacted clearing volume to the remaining clearing banks 
in the second half of  one clearing bank extended their agreement with us for a five year period and another large bank extended their agreement with us for a three year period 
after the exit of the three banks in  we will have five official check clearing banks  all of which have agreed to significantly increase their clearing activity for us 
we believe these relationships provide sufficient capacity for our official check business 
we rely on two banks to clear our retail money orders 
we entered into a new five year agreement with the smaller of our two money order clearing banks in early and are in the process of negotiating a new agreement with our primary money order clearing bank 
we also maintain contractual relationships with a variety of domestic and international cash management banks for ach and wire transfer services for the movement of consumer funds and agent settlements 
there are a limited number of international cash management banks with a network large enough to manage cash settlements for our entire agent base 
in the first half of  our current international cash management bank informed us of its intent to terminate our relationship 
this bank has indicated its willingness to continue the relationship while we convert to our new primary international cash management banking relationship 
we currently anticipate completing this process in the first half of should we not be successful in completing this process  we would be required to establish a network of numerous smaller cash management banks 
while this would not impact the timing of settling money transfers with the consumer  it could alter the pattern of settlement with our agents and increase our banking costs 
altering the pattern of settlement could result in our agent receivables and agent payables being outstanding for one to two days longer than the current pattern 
for certain of our financial institution customers  we established individual special purpose entities spes upon the origination of our relationship 
along with operational processes and certain financial covenants  these spes provide the financial institutions with additional assurance of our ability to clear their official checks 
under these relationships  the cash  cash equivalents  investments and payment service obligations related to the financial institution customer are all held by the spe 
in most cases  the fair value of the cash  cash equivalents and investments must be maintained in excess of the payment service obligations 
as the financial institution customer sells our payment service instruments  the face amount of the instrument and any fees are paid into the spe 
as payment service instruments issued by the financial institution customer are presented for payment  the cash and cash equivalents within the spe are used to settle the instrument 
as a result  cash and cash equivalents within spes are generally not available for use outside of the spe 
we remain liable to satisfy the obligations  both contractually and under the uniform commercial code  as the issuer and drawer of the official checks regardless of the existence of the spes 
accordingly  we consolidate all of the assets and liabilities of these spes in our consolidated balance sheets  with the individual assets and liabilities of the spes classified in a manner similar to our other assets and liabilities 
the combined spes hold six percent of our billion portfolio as of december  as compared to percent at december  as the spes relate to financial institution customers we terminated in connection with the restructuring of the official check business  we expect the spes to continue to decline as a percent of our portfolio as the outstanding instruments related to the financial institutions roll off over the next nine to months 
for further information relating to the spes  see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual and regulatory capital our capital needs derive from our senior facility and notes  certain clearing bank contracts  the spes and state regulatory requirements as set forth below and are based on a requirement to maintain certain assets in a defined ratio to our payment service obligation 
we monitor our compliance with these capital needs by monitoring our unrestricted assets measure  which we define as cash  cash equivalents  agent receivables  trading and available for sale investments and put options related to trading investments in excess of our payment service obligations 
as our cash  receivables and payment service obligations generally move in tandem  our unrestricted assets serve as our 
table of contents capital base 
due to the continuous nature of the sales and settlement of our payment instruments described above  we are able to maintain this capital base to provide for long term capital needs 
our primary capital objective is to have unrestricted assets in an amount which allows us to maintain compliance with all contractual and regulatory requirements during the normal fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities 
assets restricted for regulatory or contractual reasons are not available to satisfy working capital or other investing or financing needs 
our senior facility  notes  one clearing bank contract and the spes contain certain financial covenants that require us to maintain pre defined ratios of certain assets to payment service obligations as presented in the consolidated balance sheets 
one clearing bank contract has financial covenants that include the maintenance of total cash  cash equivalents  receivables and investments in an amount at least equal to total outstanding payment service obligations the total company ratio  as well as the maintenance of a minimum percent ratio of total assets held at that bank to instruments estimated to clear through that bank the clearing bank ratio 
financial covenants related to the spes include the maintenance of specified ratios  typically greater than percent  of cash  cash equivalents and investments held in the spe to outstanding payment instruments issued by the related financial institution 
in addition  under limited circumstances  the financial institution customers who are beneficiaries of the spes have the right to either demand liquidation of the assets in the spes or to replace us as the administrator of the spe 
such limited circumstances consist of material  and in most cases continued  failure to uphold our warranties and obligations pursuant to the underlying agreements with the financial institutions 
in addition  through our wholly owned subsidiary and licensed entity  mpsi  we are regulated by various state agencies that generally require us to maintain a pool of liquid assets and investments with a rating of a or higher in an amount generally equal to the regulatory payment service obligation measure  as defined by the state  for our regulated payment instruments  namely teller checks  agent checks  money orders and money transfers 
the regulatory requirements are similar to  but less restrictive than  our internal unrestricted assets measure set forth in table unrestricted assets below 
the regulatory payment service obligation measure varies by state  but in all cases is substantially lower than our payment service obligations as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets as we are not regulated by state agencies for payment service obligations resulting from outstanding cashier s checks or for amounts payable to agents and brokers 
all states require mpsi to maintain positive net worth  with one state also requiring mpsi to maintain positive tangible net worth of million 
as of december   we had excess assets over the regulatory payment service obligations cushion under our most restrictive state of billion  all other states had substantially higher cushions 
the regulatory and contractual requirements do not require us to specify individual assets held to meet our payment service obligations  nor are we required to deposit specific assets into a trust  escrow or other special account 
rather  we must maintain a pool of liquid assets 
provided we maintain a total pool of liquid assets sufficient to meet the regulatory and contractual requirements  we are able to withdraw  deposit or sell our individual liquid assets at will  with no prior notice or penalty or limitations 

table of contents table unrestricted assets december  september  june  march  december  amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents substantially restricted receivables  net substantially restricted trading investments substantially restricted put options related to trading investments available for sale investments substantially restricted amounts restricted to cover payment service obligations excess shortfall of unrestricted assets as a result of the credit market disruption and accumulating credit rating downgrades on investment securities  our investment portfolio declined in value substantially in november and december combined with management s decision in early to realign the portfolio  the decline in the investment portfolio value caused us to have a shortfall in our unrestricted assets 
due to the differences in the contractual and regulatory measures  however  the company maintained compliance with our contractual and regulatory requirements as of december  during the first quarter of  additional declines in the value of our investment portfolio resulted in us being out of compliance with certain contractual and regulatory requirements described above 
with the completion of the capital transaction  the proceeds of which replenished our capital base  we were in compliance with all contractual and regulatory requirements as of march  and have maintained compliance through december  we received waivers of default through may  from both the clearing bank and credit agreement lenders through amendments to their respective agreements 
these waivers were superseded by amendments to these agreements made in conjunction with the capital transaction 
in july  we received notice from one state that it is contemplating the assessment of a fine for the period of non compliance  although no such fine has been assessed at this time 
we believe the amount of this fine would not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
while we have not received notice from any other regulators  they reserve the right to take action in the future and could impose fines and penalties related to the compliance failure 
in completing the capital transaction  we contemplated that our investments classified as trading investments and other asset backed securities might decline further in value 
accordingly  the capital raised in the capital transaction assumed a zero value for these securities 
as a result  further unrealized losses and impairments on these securities are already funded and would not cause us to seek additional capital or financing 
we believe that our current investment portfolio and operating cash flows are sufficient to ensure on going compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements in the future as a result of the realignment of the portfolio and the capital transaction 
should capital needs exceed our investment portfolio and operating cash flows  we believe our external financing sources  including availability under the senior facility  will be sufficient to meet any shortfalls 
we do not anticipate the use of our senior facility to maintain compliance in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  we opted into a buy back program related to all three of our auction rate securities 
under this program  we received the right to sell the ars to the original trading firm at par value beginning in june  through july  the put options 
the trading firm will maintain the right to sell the ars at any time through july  and pay us at par value 
while we are not able to liquidate these auction rate securities until june  opting into the program provides us with a known cash flow from these securities  subject to the credit worthiness of the trading firm 
as the put options are separate from the auction rate security itself  opting into the program does not impact the fair value of the auction rate security 
rather  we have recognized assets separate 
table of contents from the auction rate securities equal to the fair value of the put options received  with a corresponding gain in the consolidated statements of loss income 
changes in the fair value of the put options are recognized in the net securities losses line in the consolidated statements of loss income 
in january  moody s investor service moody s  standard poors s p and fitch ratings fitch downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to non investment grade at ba  bb and bb  respectively 
in march  s p downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b 
moody s  s p and fitch have also placed us on watch for potential additional downgrades 
it is possible that one or more rating agencies will downgrade our debt rating in the future  however  there is no impact to our senior facility or notes if such a downgrade were to occur 
any change in our debt rating would not affect our regulatory status as state and federal regulatory authorities do not consider such ratings as criteria in determining licensing or regulatory compliance 
other funding sources and requirements at december   we had overdraft facilities consisting of million of letters of credit to assist in the management of our investments and the clearing of our payment service obligations 
all of these letters of credit were outstanding as of december   but no amounts have been drawn under the letters of credit

we have a funded  noncontributory pension plan that is frozen to both future benefit accruals and new participants 
our funding policy has historically been to contribute at least the minimum contribution required by applicable regulations 
we were not required to and did not make a contribution to the funded pension plan during the fair value of the pension plan assets declined by million during the year as a result of the severe market deterioration in  reducing the pension plan s funded status by approximately percent 
this decline in the funded status will accelerate minimum required contributions in the future  beginning with an estimated minimum required contribution of million for we also have certain unfunded pension and postretirement plans that require benefit payments over extended periods of time

see critical accounting policies pension obligations for further discussion of these plans 
as of december   the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is million 
as there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with liabilities relating to fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
in limited circumstances  we may grant minimum commission guarantees as an incentive to new or renewing agents  for a specified period of time at a contractually specified amount 
under the guarantees  we will pay to the agent the difference between the contractually specified minimum commission and the actual commissions earned by the agent 
as of december   the minimum commission guarantees had a maximum payment of million over a weighted average remaining term of years 
the maximum payment is calculated as the contractually guaranteed minimum commission times the remaining term of the contract and  therefore  assumes that the agent generates no money transfer transactions during the remainder of its contract

enterprise risk management risk is an inherent part of our business  particularly credit risk  interest rate risk  financial institution risk  liquidity risk  operational risk  foreign currency exchange risk and regulatory risk 
see part  item a risk factors for a description of the principal risks to our business 
the realignment of our portfolio in the first quarter of  the capital transaction  the restructuring of our official check business  the interest rate environment and the global macroeconomic environment had a significant impact on our business risks and our risk management strategies in our risk management objective is to monitor and control risk exposures to produce steady earnings growth and long term economic value 
the extent to which we properly and effectively manage each of the various types of risk is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
management implements policies approved by our board of directors that cover our investment  capital  credit and foreign currency policies and strategies 
the board receives periodic reports regarding each of these areas and approves significant changes to policy and strategy 
an asset liability committee  comprised of senior management  routinely reviews investment and risk management strategies and results 
a credit committee  comprised of senior management  routinely reviews credit exposure to our agents 
following is a discussion of the strategies we use to manage and mitigate the risks we have deemed most critical to our business 
while containing forward looking statements related to risks and uncertainties  this discussion and related analyses are not predictions of future events 
moneygram s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to various factors discussed under cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements 
credit risk credit risk  or the potential risk that we may not collect amounts owed to us  affects our business primarily through receivables  investments and derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the concentration of our cash  cash equivalents and investments at large financial institutions exposes us to credit risk 
financial institution risk our cash  cash equivalents and investments are concentrated at a few large financial institutions 
these institutions act as custodians for our asset accounts  serve as counterparties to our foreign currency transactions and conduct cash transfers on our behalf for the purpose of clearing our payment instruments and related agent receivables and agent payables 
through certain check clearing agreements and other contracts  we are required to utilize several of these financial institutions  in certain cases  we are required to maintain pre defined levels of cash  cash equivalents and investments at these financial institutions overnight 
as a result of the on going credit market crisis  several financial institutions have faced capital and liquidity issues which led them to restrict credit exposure 

table of contents we manage financial institution risk by entering into clearing and cash management agreements with only major financial institutions and regularly monitoring the credit ratings of these financial institutions 
our financial institution risk is further mitigated as the majority of our cash equivalents and investments held by these institutions are invested in securities issued by us government agencies or money market instruments collateralized by us government agencies  which have the implicit or explicit guarantee of the us government depending upon the issuing agency 
our non interest bearing cash held at our domestic clearing and cash management banks is covered under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp as those banks opted in to the program 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic has created the tlgp program to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts and certain holding companies and providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
in addition  official checks issued by our financial institution customers are treated as deposits under the tlgp 
the tlgp is currently effective for all of calendar year  at which point it will expire unless renewed by the fdic 
with respect to our credit union customers  our credit exposure is partially mitigated by ncua insurance 
however  as our credit union customers are not insured by a tlgp equivalent program  we have required certain credit union customers to provide us with larger balances on deposit and or to issue cashier s checks only 
while the value of these assets are not at risk in a disruption or collapse of a counterparty financial institution  the delay in accessing our assets could adversely affect our liquidity and potentially our earnings depending upon the severity of the delay and corrective actions we may need to take 
corrective actions could include draws upon our senior facility to provide short term liquidity until our assets are released  reimbursements of costs or payment of penalties to our agents and higher banking fees to transition banking relationships in a short timeframe 
at december   we held billion  or percent of our investment portfolio  in cash accounts at seven financial institutions with a rating of a or better and time deposits at two financial institutions with a rating of aa or better 
we held another billion of cash equivalents collateralized by securities issued by us government agencies  or percent of our investment portfolio  at nine financial institutions 
our trading and available for sale investments totaling million  or percent of our investment portfolio  are held at three financial institutions with a rating of a or better 
the remaining million  or five percent  of our investment portfolio is comprised of cash and cash equivalents held at foreign banks for use by our international subsidiaries and branches or to comply with local requirements 
receivables credit risk related to receivables is the risk that we are unable to collect the funds owed to us by our agents and financial institution customers who have collected the face amount and fees associated with the sale of our payment instruments from the consumer on our behalf 
substantially all of the business conducted by our global funds transfer segment is conducted through independent agents  while all of the business conducted by the payment systems segment is conducted through independent financial institution customers 
our agents and financial institution customers receive the face amount and fees related to the sale of our payment instruments  and we must then collect these funds from them 
as a result  we have credit exposure to our agents and financial institution customers 
agents typically have from one to three days to remit the funds  with longer remittance schedules granted to international agents and certain domestic agents 
for our global funds transfer segment  the credit exposure averages approximately million for all products and is spread across more than  agents  of which three owe us in excess of million each at any one time 
for our payment systems segment  the credit exposure averages approximately million for all products and is spread across our  financial institution customers  of which five owe us in excess of million each at any one time 
our strategy in managing credit risk related to receivables is to ensure that the revenue generation from an agent or financial institution customer is sufficient to provide for an appropriate level of credit risk and to reduce concentrations of risk through diversification  termination of agents or financial institution customers with poor risk reward ratios or other means 
management s decision during the fourth quarter of to terminate its ach business was based primarily on a review of the credit risk associated with that business 
due to the larger average face amount of money orders and official checks  we consider our credit exposure from these products to be of higher risk than exposure due to money transfers 
however  in the current macroeconomic environment and as a result of our international growth  credit risk related to our money transfer products is increasing 
while the extent of credit risk may vary by product  the process for mitigating risk is substantially the same 
we assess the creditworthiness of each potential agent before accepting them into our distribution network 

table of contents this underwriting process includes not only a determination of whether to accept a new agent  but also the remittance schedule and volume of transactions that the agent will be allowed to perform in a given timeframe 
we actively monitor the credit risk of our existing agents by conducting periodic comprehensive financial reviews and cash flow analyses of our agents who average high volumes of transactions and monitoring remittance patterns versus reported sales on a daily basis 
in the current macroeconomic environment  we have tightened our underwriting requirements and have initiated earlier action against agents with a pattern of delayed or late remittances 
we also utilize software embedded in our money transfer and retail money order point of sale equipment which provides credit risk management abilities 
first  this software allows us to control both the number and dollar amount of transactions that can be completed by both agent and location in a particular timeframe 
second  this software allows us to monitor for suspicious transactions or volumes of sales  which assists us in uncovering irregularities such as money laundering  fraud or agent self use 
finally  the software allows us to remotely disable the point of sale equipment to prevent agents from transacting if suspicious activity is noted or remittances are not received according to the agent s contract 
the point of sale software requires each location to be re authorized on a daily basis for transaction processing 
where appropriate  we will also require bank issued lines of credit to support our receivables and guarantees from the owners or parent companies  although such guarantees are often unsecured 
the risk for official check is mitigated by only selling these products through financial institution customers  who have never defaulted on their remittances to us and have had only rare instances of delayed remittances 
substantially all of our financial institution customers have a next day remit requirement  which reduces the build up of credit exposure at each financial institution 
in addition  the termination of our top financial institution customers in connection with the restructuring of official check has resulted in less concentration of exposure at a relatively small number of financial institutions 
agents who sell money orders only typically have longer remit timeframes than other agents  in addition  the per transaction revenue tends to be smaller for money orders than for money transfers 
as part of our review of the money order business  we are currently evaluating our money order only agents to identify agents where the credit risk outweighs the revenue potential 
the company will consider various mitigation actions for the identified agents  including termination of relationships  reductions in permitted transaction volumes and dollars  repricing the fees charged to the agent and prefunding by the agent of average remittances 
investment portfolio credit risk from the investment portfolio relates to the risk that we are unable to collect the interest or principal owed to us under the legal terms of the various securities 
losses due to credit risk would be reflected as investment losses and other than temporary impairments and negatively impact our net revenue 
we manage credit risk related to our investment portfolio by investing in short term assets and in issuers with strong credit ratings 
as of december   our conservative investment policy permits the investment of funds only in cash  cash equivalents and securities issued by us government agencies with a maturity of months or less 
this policy relates to both cash generated from our operations and the reinvestment of proceeds from the investment portfolio  and is not expected to change in the foreseeable future 
as shown below  with the realignment of the investment portfolio  approximately percent of our investment portfolio is comprised of cash  cash equivalents and securities issued by  or collateralized by securities issued by  us government agencies at december  percent of fair investment amounts in thousands value portfolio cash and time deposits held at large financial institutions money markets collateralized by us government agencies securities issued by or collateralized by us government agencies cash held at international banks other investments total investment portfolio as a result of the realignment of the portfolio  our credit risk primarily relates to the concentration of our investment portfolio in financial institutions and us government agencies 
we only hold assets at major financial institutions 
table of contents and manage the risk of concentration at these financial institutions by regularly monitoring their credit ratings 
while the credit market crisis and recession have affected all financial institutions  those holding our assets are well capitalized and  to date  there have been no significant concerns as to their ability to honor all obligations related to our holdings 
the concentration in us government agencies includes agencies placed under conservatorship by the us government in and extended unlimited lines of credit from the us treasury 
the implicit guarantee of the us government and its actions to date support our belief that the us government will honor the obligations of its agencies if the agencies are unable to do so themselves 
derivative financial instruments credit risk related to our derivative financial instruments relates to the risk that we are unable to collect amounts owed to us by the counterparties to our derivative agreements 
with the termination of our interest rate swaps in the second quarter of  our derivative financial instruments are used solely to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the counterparties to any of our derivative financial instruments were to default in payments or experience credit rating downgrades  the value of the derivative financial instruments would decline and adversely impact our operating income 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments by entering into agreements with only major financial institutions and regularly monitoring the credit ratings of these financial institutions 
we also only enter into agreements with financial institutions that are experienced in the foreign currency upon which the agreement is based 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the risk that our operating results are negatively impacted by changes in interest rates  and to a lesser extent  the risk that our investment portfolio declines in value due to changes in interest rates 
as a result of the realignment of our investment portfolio and the capital transaction  the impact of changes in interest rates and our strategy in managing this risk have significantly changed in historically  changes in interest rates had a significant impact on the value of our investment portfolio  which meant the company faced risks of adverse changes to our stockholders equity and unrestricted assets from declines in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
in addition  the variable rate commissions paid to our financial institution customers were not aligned with the fixed rates earned on a significant portion of our investment portfolio 
to manage interest rate risk historically  we utilized interest rate swaps and monitored a wide range of risk measures and analyses  including value at risk var modeling and income statement simulation 
var is a risk assessment methodology that estimated the potential decline in the value of our trading and available for sale investments under various volatility and interest rate scenarios  among other market conditions 
through december   we included securities classified as trading investments and other asset backed securities in our value at risk var analysis as interest rate risk was a significant factor in evaluating potential declines in the value of these securities 
effective march   interest rate risk is no longer a significant factor for these securities  rather  potential declines in value relate primarily to credit risk now 
our interest bearing cash and cash equivalents are not included in the var modeling as the rates earned on these securities are not tied to an index 
with the realignment of our investment portfolio  the portfolio is now percent comprised of cash and cash equivalents 
based on these factors  we no longer consider the var analysis to be a meaningful assessment of interest rate risk and do not utilize it as part of our risk management strategy 
given the nature of the realigned portfolio  including the high credit rating of financial institutions holding or issuing our cash and cash equivalents and the implicit guarantee of the us government backing our money markets and majority of available for sale investments  we believe there is a low risk that the value of these securities would decline such that we would have a material adverse change in our stockholders equity 
at december   the company s other asset backed securities are priced on average at four cents on the dollar for a total fair value of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company opted in to a buy back program related to its trading investments which gives us the right to put the investments to the broker at par value beginning in june the fair value of the put options received under the buy back program offset the declines in fair value of the trading investments below par 
at december   the combined fair value of the trading investments and related put options was million as compared to the million par value of the trading investments 
as time passes  the difference between the combined fair value and par value will narrow and ultimately will be zero at june assuming there is no significant deterioration in the credit rating of the related broker 
while the company does believe its other asset backed securities and trading investments are at a high risk of further decline  the capital transaction completed on march  included funds to cover all losses on these securities 
accordingly  any 
table of contents resulting adverse movement in our stockholders equity or unrestricted assets from further declines in other asset backed securities and trading investments would not result in regulatory or contractual compliance exceptions 
our operating results are primarily impacted by interest rate risk through our net investment margin  which is investment revenue less commissions expense  and interest expense 
as the money transfer business is not materially affected by investment revenue and pays commissions that are not tied to an interest rate index  interest rate risk has the most impact on our money order and official check businesses which earn most of their revenue from the investment portfolio 
after the portfolio realignment  we are invested primarily in interest bearing cash accounts and highly liquid short term investments 
these types of investment have minimal risk of declines in fair value from changes in interest rates as the rates earned reset within a short time of changes in the related interest rate index 
our commissions paid to financial institution customers are variable rate  based primarily on the effective federal funds rate and reset with each monthly payment 
accordingly  both our investment revenue and our investment commissions expense will decrease when rates decline and increase when rates rise 
however  as commission rates reset more frequently than our investments  the changes in investment revenue will lag changes in investment commissions expense 
in a declining rate environment  our net investment margin will typically be benefited by this lag  while an increasing rate environment will typically have a negative impact on our net investment margin 
in addition  the investment portfolio and commission interest rates differ  resulting in basis risk 
we do not currently employ any hedging strategies to address the basis risk between our commission rates and our investment portfolio  nor do we currently expect to employ such hedging strategies 
as a result  our net investment margin may be adversely impacted if changes in the commission rate move by a larger percentage than the yield on our investment portfolio 
in the second quarter of  we repriced our official check product to an average of effective federal funds rate less basis points to better match our investment commission rate with our lower yield realigned portfolio 
in the current environment  the effective federal funds rate is so low that most of our financial institution customers are in a negative commission position  in that we do not owe any commissions to our customers 
while many of our contracts require the financial institution customers to pay us the negative commission amount  we have opted not to require such payment at this time 
as the revenue earned by our financial institution customers from the sale of our official checks primarily comes from the receipt of their investment commissions from us  the negative commissions reduce the revenue our financial insitution customers earn from our product 
accordingly  our financial institution customers may sharply reduce their issuances of official checks if the negative commission positions continue 
a substantial decline in the amount of official checks sold would reduce our investment balances  which would in turn result in lower investment revenue for us 
as official checks are still required for many financial transactions  including home closings and vehicle purchases  we believe that risk is naturally mitigated in part 
we continue to assess the potential impact of negative commissions on our official check business 
while there are currently no plans for changes to our business as a result of the negative commissions  we may elect in the future to change some portion of our compensation structure for select financial institution customers to mitigate the risk of substantial declines in our investment balances 
our senior facility is floating rate debt  resulting in decreases to our interest expense in a declining rate environment and increases to our expense when rates rise 
we may elect to pay interest for the revolving credit facility and each term loan using the us prime rate or libor as the index and the election may be changed from time to time at our discretion 
for the revolving credit facility and the tranche a loan  the interest rate is either the us prime rate plus basis points or libor plus basis points 
for the tranche b loan  the interest rate is either the us prime rate plus basis points or libor plus basis points 
under the terms of the senior facility  the interest rate determined using the libor index has a minimum rate of percent 
through  we paid interest using the libor index 
effective with our first interest payment in  we elected to use the us prime rate 
our elections are based on the index which we believe will yield the lowest interest rate until the next reset date 
we plan to manage the interest rate risk through the index election and do not currently have plans to utilize interest rate swaps 
the income statement simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
this analysis assumes the yield curve increases gradually over a one year period 
components of our pre tax income which are interest rate sensitive include investment revenue  investment commissions expense 
table of contents and interest expense 
as a result of the current federal funds rate environment  the outcome of the income statement simulation analysis on investment commissions expense in a declining rate scenario is not meaningful as we have no downside risk 
in the current federal funds rate environment  the worst case scenario is that we would not owe any commissions to our financial institution customers as the commission rate would decline to zero or become negative 
accordingly  we have not presented the impact of the simulation in a declining rate environment for investment commissions expense

we offer our products and services through a network of agents and financial institutions with locations in over countries 
foreign exchange risk is managed through the structure of our business and certain business processes 
we are primarily affected by fluctuations in the us dollar as compared to the euro as a significant amount of our international transactions and settlements with international agents are conducted in the euro 
our foreign currency exposure is naturally limited by the fact that foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are generally very short term in nature 
we primarily utilize forward contracts with maturities of less than thirty days to hedge our balance sheet exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
by policy  we do not speculate in foreign currencies and we promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies 
the forward contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
the net effect of changes in exchange rates and the related forward contracts was not significant for the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are substantially denominated in the euro 
the impact of changes in the euro exchange rate have historically not been material to our consolidated statement of loss income as the changes in revenue are substantially offset by changes in operating expenses 
as we continue to grow our business internationally  the impact of fluctuations in the euro may become material to our operating results 
we are currently undergoing an analysis of the various foreign currency exchange risk mitigation tools available to us and may utilize foreign currency instruments more frequently in the future 
in  the strength of the euro decreased our consolidated net loss by approximately million for had the euro appreciated relative to the us dollar by percent over actual exchange rates for  pre tax operating income would have increased million for the year 
had the euro depreciated by percent under actual rates for  pre tax operating income would have decreased million for the year 
this sensitivity analysis considers both the impact on translation of our foreign denominated revenue and expense streams and the impact on our hedging program 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on a regular basis  management reviews its accounting policies  assumptions and estimates to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and that require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
based on these criteria  management has identified and discussed with the audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates  including the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
fair value of investment securities we hold investment securities classified as trading and available for sale 
trading securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the consolidated statements of loss income 
available for sale securities are also recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders deficit 
we measure fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value as an exit price  or the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas no 
establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the observability of the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability  and requires that the use of observable inputs be maximized and the use of unobservable inputs be minimized 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of an investment is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
fair value for the majority of our investments is estimated using quoted market prices in active markets  broker quotes or industry standard models that utilize independently sourced market parameters 
these independently sourced market parameters are observable in the marketplace  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions for similar securities are executed in the marketplace 
examples of such parameters include  but are not limited to  interest rate yield curves  reported trades  broker or dealer quotes  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids  offers and reference data 
we receive prices from an independent pricing service for the vast majority of the fair value of our trading and available for sale investments 
we verify these prices through periodic internal valuations  as well as through comparison to comparable securities  any broker quotes received and liquidation prices 
the independent pricing service will only provide a price for an investment if there is sufficient observable market information to obtain objective pricing 
we receive prices from an independent pricing service for investments classified as obligations of states and political subdivisions  commercial mortgage backed securities  residential mortgage backed securities  us government agencies  corporate debt securities  preferred and common stock and certain other asset backed securities 
for investments that are not actively traded  or for which there is not sufficient observable market information  we estimate fair value using broker quotes when available 
when such quotes are not available  as well as to verify broker quotes received  we estimate fair value using industry standard pricing models  discount margins for comparable securities adjusted for differences in our security  risk and liquidity premiums observed in the market place  default rates  prepayment speeds  loss severity and information specific to the underlying collateral to the investment 
we maximize the use of market observable information to the extent possible and make our best estimate of the assumptions that a similar market participant would make 
investments which are primarily valued through the use of broker quotes or internal valuations include those classified as other asset backed securities and certain commercial mortgage backed securities 

table of contents the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
due to the subjective nature of these assumptions  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the actual exit price if the investment was sold at the measurement date 
in the current market  the most subjective assumptions include the default rate of collateral securities and loss severity as it relates to our other asset backed securities and illiquidity discounts for trading investments 
in  we sold substantially all of our investments classified as other asset backed securities 
as of december   we continue to hold investments classified as other asset backed securities with a fair value of million at december  using the highest and lowest prices received as part of the valuation process described above  the range of fair value for these securities was million to million 
at december   million  or less than one percent  of our trading and available for sale investments were valued using internal pricing information 
of this amount  million related to investments for which no price was received from the third party pricing service or brokers 
had we used the third party price to value the remaining million of internally priced securities  the value of these investments would have ranged from million to million 
other than temporary impairment investments with gross unrealized losses at the measurement date are subject to our process for identifying other than temporary impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 views on accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities 
we write down to fair value investments that we deem to be other than temporarily impaired through a charge against earnings in the period the securities are deemed to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value at the individual security level 
we deem an individual investment to be other than temporarily impaired when the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value have made it probable in management s view that we will not receive all of the cash flows contractually stipulated for the investment 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely manner and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
pursuant to our review process  changes in individual security values and credit risk characteristics are regularly monitored to identify potential impairment indicators 
for all investments  we assess market conditions  macroeconomic factors and industry developments each period to identify any impairment indicators 
if an impairment indicator is identified  we perform a credit assessment of the impacted investments 
in addition  we review all investments meeting established thresholds and monitoring criteria to identify investments that have indications of potential impairments or unfavorable trends that could lead to future potential impairments 
these thresholds and monitoring criteria include investments with a fair value significantly less than amortized cost  in an unrealized loss position for more than months or with a rating downgrade or significant decline in fair value from the prior period 
through december   we also performed a periodic credit risk assessment for each of our asset backed securities under a systematic methodology  with the exception of investments backed by us government agency securities 
the methodology employed a risk driven approach  whereby securities were assigned to risk classes based on internally defined criteria 
the risk classes drove the frequency of the review  with investments in the highest risk class reviewed monthly 
with the realignment of the investment portfolio in the first quarter of  this assessment is no longer meaningful as any decline in our asset backed securities is considered an other than temporary impairment as management no longer intends to hold these securities until maturity or recovery 
in assessing an investment with impairment indicators for other than temporary impairment  we evaluate the facts and circumstances specific to the investment  including  but not limited to  the following evaluation of current and future cash flow performance  reason for decline in the fair value of the investment  actual default rates of underlying collateral  subordination available as credit protection on our investment in a securitized transaction  
table of contents credit rating downgrades on both our investment and the underlying collateral to the investment  extent of unrealized loss and the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss position  failure of structured investments to meet minimum coverage or collateralization tests  new information regarding the investment or the issuer  deterioration in the market  industry or geographical area relevant to the issuer or underlying collateral  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to either receive all contractual cash flows or for the investment to recover to its amortized cost 
as we have an available for sale investment portfolio and generally do not utilize our portfolio for liquidity purposes  we believe that our intent and ability to hold an investment and the ability of the investment to generate cash flows are the primary factors in assessing whether an investment in an unrealized loss position is other than temporarily impaired 
if we no longer have the intent or ability to hold the investment to maturity or call  and it is probable that the investment will not provide all of its contractual cash flows  then we believe an investment in an unrealized loss position is other than temporarily impaired 
in assessing our intent and ability  we evaluate our needs under regulatory and contractual requirements  changes to our investment strategy and anticipated cash flow needs  including any anticipated customer contract terminations 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are used as part of our risk management strategy to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendments and interpretations 
the derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  with the change in fair value recognized in earnings or in other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
a derivative that does not qualify  or is not designated  as a hedge will be reflected at fair value  with changes in value recognized through earnings 
the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments has been determined using available market information and certain valuation methodologies 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in the second quarter of  the company terminated all of its interest rate swaps and recognized a million loss in earnings 
as of december   we had million of unrealized gains on derivative financial instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  all of which related to forward currency agreements 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring or did not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our hedging activities as the counterparties are generally well established  well capitalized financial institutions 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  as well as testing whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
the fair value of our reporting units is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
if the growth rate for our reporting units with goodwill assigned decreases by basis points from the growth rates used in the valuation  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the discount rate for our reporting units with goodwill assigned increases by basis points from 
table of contents the discount rate used in the valuation  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit the business formerly known as ach commerce  which is a component of our payment systems segment 
as a result  we recognized an million goodwill impairment charge

we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during see note intangibles and goodwill of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension obligations we provide defined benefit pension plan coverage to certain of our employees  as well as former employees of viad 
our pension obligations were measured as of november through and as of december beginning in the measurement date 
the change in measurement date is due to the adoption of the measurement date provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  on january  pension benefits and the related expense are based upon actuarial projections using assumptions regarding mortality  discount rates  long term return on assets and other factors 
following are the assumptions used to measure the projected benefit obligation as of each measurement date and the net periodic benefit cost for the year ended december net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase projected benefit obligation discount rate rate of compensation increase our pension expense for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
pension expense is calculated in part based upon the actuarial assumptions shown above 
at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on the then current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our obligations 
the rate of compensation increase is based on historical compensation patterns for the plan participants and management s expectations for future compensation patterns 
our pension assets are primarily invested in marketable securities that have readily determinable current market values 
our investments are periodically realigned in accordance with the investment guidelines 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical market experience  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long term rates of return 
current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
we also consider peer data and historical returns to assess the reasonableness and appropriateness of our expected return 
our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is based upon plan obligations  an evaluation of market conditions  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments 
our asset allocation at december  consists of approximately percent in us domestic and international equity stock funds  approximately percent in fixed income securities such as global bond funds and corporate obligations  approximately percent in a real estate limited partnership interest and approximately percent in other securities 
the investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income securities 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
certain of the assumptions  particularly the discount rate and expected return on plan assets  require significant judgment and could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligation 
changing the discount rate by basis points would have increased decreased pension expense by million 
the actual rate of return on average pension assets in was a decline of percent as a result of the substantial disruption in the market and the global recession during the year  as compared to the expected rate of return of percent 
as the expected rate of return is a long term assumption and the widely accepted capital market principle is that assets with higher volatility generate greater long term returns  we do not believe that the actual return for one year is 
table of contents significantly different from the expected return used to determine the benefit obligation 
in addition  the participants of our plans are relatively young  providing the plan assets with sufficient time to recover to historical return rates 
changing the expected rate of return by basis points would have increased decreased pension expense by million 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
income before taxes is adjusted for various differences between local tax laws and generally accepted accounting principles 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the income tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the applicable enacted statutory tax rates 
management assesses the likelihood of whether deferred tax assets will be realized based on the weight of available evidence 
to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established in the period in which the determination is made 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in our consolidated statements of loss income 
on january   we adopted fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit by the tax authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
actual tax amounts may be materially different from amounts accrued based upon the results of audits by the tax authorities 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate based on current information and management s best estimate  as well as any applicable related net interest and penalties 
prior to our spin off from viad  income taxes were determined on a separate return basis as if we had not been eligible to be included in the consolidated income tax return of viad and its affiliates 
we are considered the divesting entity in the spin off and treated as the accounting successor to viad  with the continuing business of viad is referred to as new viad 
as part of the spin off  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with viad which provides for  among other things  the allocation between us and new viad of federal  state  local and foreign tax liabilities and tax liabilities resulting from the audit or other adjustment to previously filed tax returns 
although we believe that we have appropriately proportioned such taxes between ourself and viad  subsequent adjustments may occur upon filing of amended returns or resolution of audits by various taxing authorities
