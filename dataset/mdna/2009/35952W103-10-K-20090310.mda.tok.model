these statements represent projections  beliefs and expectations based on current circumstances and conditions and in light of recent events and trends  and you should not construe these statements either as assurances of performances or as promises of a given course of action 
instead  various known and unknown factors are likely to cause our actual performance and management s actions to vary  and the results of these variances may be both material and adverse 
a list of the known material factors that may cause our results to vary  or may cause management to deviate from its current plans and expectations  is included in item a risk factors 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included herein 
overview we design  manufacture and supply alternative fuel components and systems to the transportation  industrial and power generation industries on a global basis 
our components and systems control the pressure and flow of gaseous alternative fuels  such as propane and natural gas  for use in internal combustion engines 
our products improve efficiency  enhance power output and reduce emissions by electronically sensing and regulating the proper proportion of fuel and air required by the internal combustion engine 
we also provide engineering and systems integration services to address our individual customer requirements for product performance  durability and physical configuration 
for years  we have developed alternative fuel products 
we supply our products and systems to the market place through a global distribution network of over distributors and dealers in more than countries and more than original equipment manufacturers 
our management believes that the company operates in two business segments  impco operations and brc operations 
impco operations manufactures and sells products for use primarily in the industrial market  including complete certified engines  fuel systems  parts and conversion systems for applications in the transportation  material handling  stationary and portable power generator markets 
its sales are conducted through its us and foreign facilities in the netherlands and japan and through distribution channels 
brc operations manufactures and sells products for use primarily in the transportation market in italy and through its foreign facilities in argentina  brazil and australia 
our impco operations recently announced its intention to expand into the us automotive alternative fuel transportation market 
as of december   the impco operations had not yet derived any sales from the us automotive alternative fuel transportation market 
corporate expenses consist of general and administrative expenses at fuel systems solutions 
intercompany sales between impco operations and brc operations have been eliminated in the results reported 
net income was million on revenue of approximately million in as compared to net income of million on revenue of approximately million in operating income increased by approximately million to million  compared to million for the same period in net income was million on revenue of approximately million in as compared to net income of million on revenue of approximately million in operating income decreased by approximately million to million  compared to million for the same period in results for the year ended december  improved from due the increase in revenue in the transportation market  particularly in sales for post production oem conversions

in addition  brc also recorded a million unrealized gain in currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro during related to the loan between mtm and impco us we cannot predict nor assure that the trends and operating performance of impco or brc will continue into or be as favorable for future reporting periods or fiscal years 
for future reporting periods or fiscal years  we cannot predict the direction of the movements in foreign exchange which were unfavorable in both and results for the year ended december  include million in expenses related to our voluntary stock option investigation and related restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements and a new brc marketing and advertising campaign which took place during in europe  as well as an increase in the reserve for the loan between brc and wmtm 
brc also recorded a million unrealized loss in currency fluctuations between the dollar and the euro during related to the loan between mtm and impco us recent developments acquisition of distribuidora shopping sa and tomasetto achille sa 
table of contents on january   we completed the acquisition of distribuidora shopping sa and its subsidiary tomasetto achille sa from alessandro carlo evi and susana iallonardi collectively  the sellers 
distribuidora shopping and tomasetto achille are headquartered in argentina and manufacture  import  export and market natural gas kits for vehicles 
the aggregate purchase price for of the equity of the acquired companies was million in cash  subject to a post closing adjustment upward by adding to the purchase price the acquired companies cash and bank account balances at closing and an adjustment downward by subtracting from the purchase price the acquired companies debt at the closing 
a portion of the funds that we used in the acquisition were provided according to the terms of the credit facility between mtm and intesa sanpaolo spa dated december  as part of the closing of this acquisition  the sellers used million of the purchase price they received from mtm to acquire  shares of our common stock in a transaction exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended 
of the  shares of our common stock issued in the private placement   shares of were issued from treasury stock and  shares will remain in escrow for up to six years in order to cover unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired companies and to satisfy any claims for indemnification that we may have against the sellers during that time 
our losses will not be limited to the value of the escrow shares  but we must deplete the escrow shares before seeking any amount in cash from the sellers 
mtm loan on january   impco us repaid in full the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the amounts it owed to mtm under the intercompany loan originally entered into on december  the aggregate amount impco us paid to retire the mtm loan was million  comprising million of principal and of accrued and unpaid interest 
since impco us has fulfilled its financial obligation under the mtm loan  the guarantors have cancelled their guarantees and released us from our related pledge of brc s stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  taxes  inventories  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies related to the following accounts or activities are those that are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the more significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally when products are shipped provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and management believes collectability is reasonably assured 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable unless they are secured under an irrevocable letter of credit arrangement guaranteed by a reputable financial institution  and accordingly  we defer such revenue until amounts become due and payable 
the costs of shipping and handling  when incurred  are recognized in the cost of goods sold 
we provide for returns and allowances as circumstances and facts require 
sales to our unconsolidated subsidiaries are made on terms similar to those prevailing with unrelated customers as noted above 
we defer a pro rata portion of the gross profit on sales for the inventory of the unconsolidated subsidiaries until the inventory is sold to a third party customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified through management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based  in part  on historical experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
we believe that our warranty experience is within the industry norms 
our standard warranty period is to months from the date of delivery to the customer depending on the product 
the warranty obligation on our certified engine products can vary from three to five years depending on the specific part and the actual hours of usage 
inventory reserves we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
management considers each subsidiary to be a reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually at year end 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we operate wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
we record goodwill at the time of purchase for the amount of the purchase price over the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
during the second quarter of  changes in the australian business climate indicated that the goodwill for impco technologies  pty 
limited  or impco australia  our australian subsidiary  might be impaired 
as a result  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we performed an analysis and recorded an impairment charge of million to fully impair impco australia s goodwill balance  which was included as a separate component of operating income in the quarter ended june  and the year ended december  the fair value analysis for the impairment charge was prepared by management that relied in part on a third party fair market valuation for impco australia 
at december   the company performed an annual impairment test of goodwill and concluded that the remaining goodwill was not impaired 
intangible assets we amortize intangible assets acquired if they are determined to have definite useful lives 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology and trade names  are amortized on a straight line basis  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefits  over their estimated reasonable useful lives 
certain other intangible assets such as customer relationships are amortized using an accelerated method since the value of customer relationships is expected to decline at a faster rate 
deferred taxes based upon the substantial net operating loss carryforwards and expected future operating results  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets in the united states at december  may not be realized within the foreseeable future 
the balance of the total valuation allowance was million as of december  in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits realized in the united states until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets 
as of december   undistributed earnings  except with respect to a portion of undistributed earnings from brc  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for united states federal and state income taxes is provided thereon 
upon distributions of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us 
table of contents income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
we have accrued such residual income taxes for all undistributed foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
it is not practical to determine the income tax impact in the event we repatriate undistributed foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested 
as of december   approximately million in foreign withholding taxes was accrued related to undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
additionally  there are residual us taxes that have been accrued applied as a reduction to net operating loss carry forwards on approximately million of earnings of brc for the mtm loan 
such amounts could be drawn as a dividend from brc in the future without us income tax consequences 
foreign currency agreements we recognize changes in the fair value of a foreign currency agreement as a component of other income and expense on the consolidated statement of operations  unless the agreement qualifies under hedge accounting 
if hedge accounting applies  changes in the fair value of the hedging agreement would be deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as other income and expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and in an effort to more appropriately align the structure and business activities within fuel systems into our two operating segments  on july  impco sold its subsidiary  impco australia  to brc

operating income for brc operations improved in as compared to  but was partially offset by a decline in operating income for impco operations in as compared to impco operations 
during  revenue decreased by approximately million  or  to million  from million during the decrease in revenue during was due a decrease in demand in the industrial market caused by reduced spending by original equipment manufacturers as a result of uncertainties associated with the world economy 
operating income for decreased by approximately million to million  or of revenue  compared to million in  or revenue 
the decrease is due to the decrease in revenue discussed above as well as increased research and development expenses being incurred to develop the new tier iv fuel systems to meet the environmental protection agency emission standards which are effective january  and an increase in inventory reserve of million 
brc operations 
during  revenue increased by approximately million  or  to million  from million during the increase in revenue in is due in large part to an increase in sales for post production oem conversions driven by government incentives in europe as well as growth in sales of aftermarket conversion kits in the transportation market  driven by automotive manufacturers promoting gaseous fuel equipment

the incremental amount for revenues related to zavoli in was million 
brc s operating income for increased by approximately million to million  or of revenue  compared to million in  or revenue 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue and to an increase in gross margin due to a change in mix of products sold and increasing utilization of existing manufacturing capacity  partially offset by an increase in the reserve for the loan and for the reserves on other receivables from brc s joint venture  wmtm  of million in order to fully impair the loan  an increase in inventory reserve of million  transaction costs of million related to the acquisition of distribuidora shopping sa and tomasetto achille sa in january and a goodwill impairment loss of million

table of contents for and  we recorded amortization expense of approximately million and million  respectively  for the intangible assets  and approximately million and million  respectively  for depreciation expense of the step up in fair value of fixed assets related to the acquisition of brc and zavoli 
in future years  the amount of amortization and depreciation will vary due to future changes to the remaining useful lives  movements in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  and the use of an accelerated amortization schedule for the fair value allocated to customer relationships  however  we estimate that the amount of combined amortization and depreciation during will be approximately million 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses consist of general and administrative expenses at the corporate level to support our business segments in areas such as executive management  finance  human resources  management information systems  legal and accounting services and investor relations 
corporate expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were approximately million compared to approximately million in the prior year 
corporate expenses in decreased compared to primarily because of the high costs we incurred in connection with our voluntary stock option investigation and resulting restatement of our financial statements in  partially offset by million of severance costs recorded in the second quarter of for our former chief financial officer 
interest income 
interest income was approximately million in and approximately million in interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in and other income and expense 
other income and expense is primarily composed of unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses between the us dollar and the euro with respect to marking to market of the mtm loan balance and the gains and losses with respect to the fair value determination of the related foreign exchange hedging agreement since the agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in unrealized gains on foreign exchange in connection with the mtm loan due to the weakening of the euro over the u 
s dollar  increased by a gain on the foreign currency agreement of approximately million

in  impco us recorded income tax expense of million primarily from accruing for foreign tax withholdings on undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested as well as amortization of goodwill for tax purposes  which is not offset against the deferred tax asset in determining the required valuation allowance 
based upon the substantial net operating loss carryforwards and expected future operating results  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that substantially all of the deferred tax assets in the united states at december  may not be realized within the foreseeable future 
we expect to reduce the valuation allowance if we are profitable or provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits realized in the united states if we have additional losses until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets each quarter

sfas no 
establishes a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
this hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
this includes certain pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency management 
the results and financial condition of our international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between certain foreign currencies and the us dollar 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased as a result of the growth of our international subsidiaries 
the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries is the local currency of the subsidiary 
an increase in the value of the us dollar increases the costs incurred by our subsidiaries  as a significant amount of our international subsidiaries inventory purchases are us dollar denominated  and thus the cost of our products  adversely affecting our competitiveness and profitability 
we monitor this risk and attempt to minimize the exposure through the management of cash disbursements in local currencies and  when deemed appropriate  the use of forward currency contracts
