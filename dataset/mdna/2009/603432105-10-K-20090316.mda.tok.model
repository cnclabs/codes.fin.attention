the market prices of base and precious metals such as copper and silver fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of any mining company 
these factors include expectations with regard to the rate of inflation  the exchange rates of the dollar and other currencies  interest rates  global or regional political  economic or banking crises  and a number of other factors 
if the market price of silver or copper should drop dramatically  the value of the company s montanore project could drop and the company might not be able to recover its investment in that project 
the decision to develop or construct a mine would be made several years before the first revenues from production would be received 
price fluctuations between the time that such decision is made and the commencement of production could affect the economics of the mine
