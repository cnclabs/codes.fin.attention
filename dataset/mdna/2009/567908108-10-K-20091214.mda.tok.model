item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this report  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the largest recreational boat retailer in the united states with fiscal revenue in excess of million 
through our current retail locations in states  we sell new and used recreational boats and related marine products  including engines  trailers  parts  and accessories 
we also arrange related boat financing  insurance  and extended warranty contracts  provide boat repair and maintenance services  and offer yacht and boat brokerage services  and where available  offer slip and storage accommodations 
marinemax was incorporated in january we commenced operations with the acquisition of five independent recreational boat dealers on march  since the initial acquisitions in march  we have acquired recreational boat dealers  two boat brokerage operations  and two full service yacht repair facilities 
as a part of our acquisition strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with various recreational boat dealers regarding their potential acquisition by us 
potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues  including  in some cases  management succession and related matters 
as a result of these and other factors  a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated 
we did not complete any significant acquisitions during the fiscal years ended september  and general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results 
unfavorable local  regional  national  or global economic developments or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could reduce consumer spending in the markets we serve and adversely affect our business 
economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships  particularly florida in which we generated   and of our revenue during fiscal   and  respectively  can have a major impact on our operations 
local influences  such as corporate downsizing  military base closings  and inclement weather  also could adversely affect our operations in certain markets 
in an economic downturn  consumer discretionary spending levels generally decline  at times resulting in disproportionately large reductions in the sale of luxury goods 
consumer spending on luxury goods also may decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels  even if prevailing economic conditions are favorable 
although we have expanded our operations during periods of stagnant or modestly declining industry trends  the cyclical nature of the recreational boating industry or the lack of industry growth could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations in the future 
any period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence has a negative effect on our business 
lower consumer spending resulting from a downturn in the housing market and other economic factors adversely affected our business in fiscal  and continued weakness in consumer spending resulting from substantial weakness in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions had a very substantial negative effect on our business in fiscal and fiscal these conditions caused us to defer our acquisition program  slow our new store openings  reduce our inventory purchases  engage in inventory reduction efforts  close a significant number of our retail locations  and significantly reduce our headcount 
we cannot predict the length or severity of these unfavorable economic or financial conditions or the extent to which they will adversely affect our operating results nor can we predict the effectiveness of the measures we have taken to address this environment or whether additional measures will be necessary 
although economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results  we have capitalized on our core strengths to substantially outperform the industry  resulting in leading market share 
our ability to produce such market share supports the alignment of our retailing strategies with the desires of consumers 
we believe the steps we have taken to address weak market conditions will yield an increase in future revenue 
as general economic trends improve  we expect our core strengths and retailing strategies will position us to capitalize on growth opportunities as they occur and will allow us to emerge from this challenging environment with greater earnings potential 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from boat  motor  and trailer sales  and parts and service operations at the time the boat  motor  trailer  or part is delivered to or accepted by the customer or service is completed 
we recognize commissions earned from a brokerage sale at the time the related brokerage transaction closes 
we recognize revenue from slip and storage services on a straight line basis over the term of the slip or storage agreement 
we recognize commissions earned by us for placing notes with financial institutions in connection with customer boat financing when we recognize the related boat sales 
we also recognize marketing fees earned on credit life  accident and disability  and hull insurance products sold by third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the insurance product as evidenced by contract execution or when the related boat sale is recognized 
we also recognize commissions earned on extended warranty service contracts sold on behalf of third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the service contract terms  as evidenced by contract execution or recognition of the related boat sale 
certain finance and extended warranty commissions and marketing fees on insurance products may be charged back if a customer terminates or defaults on the underlying contract within a specified period of time 
based upon our experience of repayments and defaults  we maintain a chargeback allowance that was not material to our financial statements taken as a whole as of september  or should results differ materially from our historical experiences  we would need to modify our estimate of future chargebacks  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins 
vendor consideration received we account for consideration received from our vendors in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  revenue recognition  customer payments and incentives asc  previously referred to as emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
asc most significantly requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders 
pursuant to asc  amounts received by us under our co op assistance programs from our manufacturers are netted against related advertising expenses 
inventories inventory costs consist of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  net of vendor consideration and purchase discounts  the cost of equipment added  reconditioning costs  and transportation costs relating to acquiring inventory for sale 
we state new boat  motor  and trailer inventories at the lower of cost  determined on a specific identification basis  or market 
we state used boat  motor  and trailer inventories  including trade in s  at the 
table of contents lower of cost  determined on a specific identification basis  or market 
we state parts and accessories at the lower of cost  determined on an average cost basis  or market 
we utilize our historical experience  the aging of the inventories  and our consideration of current market trends as the basis for determining lower of cost or market valuation allowance 
as of september  and  our lower of cost or market valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
if events occur and market conditions change  causing the fair value to fall below carrying value  the lower of cost or market valuation allowance could increase 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  intangibles goodwill and other asc  previously referred to as statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the first step in the assessment is the estimation of fair value 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  we perform the second step to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment exists when the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value 
during the three months ended june   we experienced a significant decline in stock market valuation driven primarily by weakness in the marine retail industry and an overall soft economy  which hindered our financial performance 
accordingly  we completed a step one analysis as noted above and estimated the fair value of the reporting unit as prescribed by asc  which indicated potential impairment 
as a result  we completed a fair value analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets and a step two goodwill impairment analysis  as required by asc we determined that indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill were impaired and recorded a non cash charge of million based on our assessment 
we will not be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of this impairment charge 
impairment of long lived assets fasb accounting standards codification  property  plant  and equipment  impairment of disposal of long lived assets asc  previously referred to as statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
estimates of expected future cash flows represent our best estimate based on currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
any impairment recognized in accordance with asc is permanent and may not be restored 
as of september   we had not recognized any impairment of long lived assets in connection with asc based on our reviews 
during the three months ended june   we experienced a significant decline in market valuation driven primarily by weakness in the marine retail industry and an overall soft economy  which adversely affected our financial performance 
as a result of this weakness  we realized a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge  as noted above 
based on these events  we reviewed the valuation of our investment in gulfport in accordance with asc and recoverability of the assets contained within the joint venture 
asc requires the recognition of a loss in value of an investment  which is other than a temporary decline 
we reviewed our investment and assets contained within the gulfport joint venture  which consists of land  buildings  equipment  and goodwill 
as a result  we determined that our investment in the joint venture was impaired and recorded a non cash charge of million based on our assessment 
we will not be required to make any current or future cash expenditures as a result of this impairment charge 

table of contents stock based compensation effective october   we adopted the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification  compensation stock compensation asc  previously referred to as statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  for our share based compensation plans 
we adopted asc using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized includes a the compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of asc and b the compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc additionally  we accounted for restricted stock awards granted using the measurement and recognition provisions of asc accordingly  the fair value of the restricted stock awards is measured on the grant date and recognized in earnings over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  income taxes asc  previously referred to as statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes and financial accounting standard board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
under asc  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to be recovered or settled 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized by considering all available positive and negative evidence 
pursuant to asc  we must consider all positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  including past operating results and future sources of taxable income 
under the provisions of asc  we determined that our net deferred tax asset needed to be fully reserved given recent earnings and industry trends 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  also included in asc the interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not of being sustained

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year ended september  amounts in thousands revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge income loss from operations interest expense  net income loss before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit net income loss fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  revenue 
revenue decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  of this decrease  million was attributable to a decline in comparable store sales and million was attributable to stores closed in fiscal that are not eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base for the months ended september  the decline in our comparable store sales was due to the widely reported weak economic conditions and tighter retail lending environment  which have adversely impacted our retail sales 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars reflected the combination of the significant reduction in revenue because of the soft economic environment and the decreases in gross profit percentage 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due to margin pressure arising from the difficult retail environment and the aggressive pricing strategy that we deployed to drive a significant reduction to our inventory levels 
additionally  during the fiscal  we incurred losses and increased reserves for expected losses associated with market declines in brands we no longer carry by approximately million 
lastly  we strategically decided to forego certain manufacturer purchase incentives and ordered substantially less boats in fiscal than in fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the fiscal year ended september  included million in charges associated with store closures 
the fiscal year ended september  included million in charges associated with store closures  partially offset by million in gains recorded as an expense offset related to proceeds from business interruption insurance claims and the favorable settlement of certain interest rate swaps 
excluding these items would result in a comparable selling  general  and administrative expense reduction of million  or  and selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  this increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the reported same store sales decline  which resulted in a 
table of contents reduction in our ability to leverage our expense structure 
the reduction in the dollar level of selling  general  and administrative expenses was due to the significant reductions we have made in personnel  retail locations  and most other expense categories 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
during the fiscal year ended september   we were required to write off our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of the decline in our market valuation and the continuation of the difficult retail environment  as prescribed by asc interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of the decline in average borrowings throughout fiscal income tax provision 
our income tax benefit decreased million to a benefit of million for the fiscal year ended september  from an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended september   primarily as a result of limitations on the carryback of our pretax loss and recording a valuation allowance on the carryforward pretax loss 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september  differed from previous periods primarily as a result of the recording of a non cash valuation allowance that offsets the majority of income tax benefit that would have arisen from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  revenue 
revenue decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from billion for the fiscal year ended september  of this decrease  million was attributable to stores opened  closed  or acquired that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base and million was attributable to a decline in comparable store sales in fiscal the decline in our same store sales resulted primarily from softer economic conditions because of the turmoil in the financial markets  which impacted our results as well as those of most other retailers 
in response to these declines  we are adjusting our structure  including store closures  in a manner in which we believe will reduce operating costs but not result in market share losses 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in gross profit was a result of the significant reduction in revenue resulting from the soft economic environment 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due to margin pressure arising from the difficult retail environment and a sales mix shift to larger products  which historically carry lower gross margins 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  the fiscal year ended september  included million in charges associated with store closures  partially offset by million in gains recorded as an expense offset related to proceeds from business interruption insurance claims associated with ice storms damage at certain missouri locations in and the favorable settlement of certain interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges 
additionally  the fiscal year ended september  included million in gains recorded as an expense offset related to business interruption insurance proceeds that was received for claims associated with hurricane wilma in  the sale of our corporate jet  and insurance proceeds we received associated with the ice storm damage at certain missouri locations 
excluding these items would result in a comparable selling  general  and administrative expense reduction of million  or and selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  this increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the reported same store sales decline  which resulted in a reduction in our ability to leverage our expense structure 

table of contents goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
during the fiscal year ended september   we were required to write off our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of the decline in our market valuation and the continuation of the difficult retail environment  as prescribed by asc interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of a more favorable interest rate environment in fiscal  which accounted for a decrease of approximately million in interest expense 
income tax provision 
income taxes decreased million to a benefit of million for the fiscal year ended september  from an income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended september   primarily as a result of our pretax loss 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september  differed from previous periods primarily as a result of the recording of a non cash valuation allowance that offsets the majority of income tax benefit that would have arisen from the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 
quarterly data and seasonality our business  as well as the entire recreational boating industry  is highly seasonal  with seasonality varying in different geographic markets 
with the exception of florida  we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories  and related short term borrowings  in the quarterly periods ending december and march the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in january stimulates boat sales and allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year 
our business could become substantially more seasonal as we acquire dealers that operate in colder regions of the united states 
our business is also subject to weather patterns  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels or excessive rain may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient  thereby curtailing customer demand for our products 
in addition  unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations 
hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities  as has been the case when florida and other markets were hit by hurricanes 
although our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area  these conditions will continue to represent potential  material adverse risks to us and our future financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations  including new and used boat and related parts inventories  off season liquidity  and growth through acquisitions and new store openings 
we regularly monitor the aging of our inventories and current market trends to evaluate our current and future inventory needs 
we also use this evaluation in conjunction with our review of our current and expected operating performance and expected customer demand to determine the adequacy of our financing needs 
these cash needs have historically been financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our line of credit facility 
our ability to utilize our credit facility to fund operations depends upon the collateral levels and compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
turmoil in the credit markets and weakness in the retail markets may interfere with our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility and therefore utilize the credit facility to fund operations 
at september   we were in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  we did not complete any acquisitions 
we currently depend upon dividends and other payments from our dealerships and our line of credit facility to fund our current operations and meet our cash needs 
currently  no agreements exist that restrict this flow of funds from our dealerships 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  cash provided by operating activities approximated million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to net income  adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation charges  and increases in customer deposits and accrued expenses  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in inventories to ensure appropriate inventory levels 
for the fiscal year ended 
table of contents september   cash used in operating activities was due primarily to our net loss  a decrease in accounts payable because of reductions in purchases from our manufacturers  and a decrease in customer deposits due to a reduction in pending sales 
these amounts were primarily offset by noncash charges  including the impairment of goodwill  stock based compensation  and depreciation and amortization expense 
the cash used in operating activities was further offset by reductions in inventories and accounts receivables due to the reduction in sales trends 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the significant reduction of inventories 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase property and equipment associated with opening new retail facilities or improving and relocating existing retail facilities and in the finalization of certain business acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds received from the sale and involuntary conversion of property and equipment 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase property and equipment associated with opening new retail facilities or improving and relocating existing retail facilities 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase property and equipment associated with improving and relocating existing retail facilities 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  cash used in financing activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock and repayments of long term debt  partially offset by proceeds from net borrowings on short term borrowings as a result of increased inventory levels and proceeds from common shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and under the employee stock purchase plan 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a net increase in short term borrowings  partially offset by repayments of long term debt 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used by financing activities was primarily attributable to the repayments of short term borrowings  partially offset by proceeds from our common stock sale 
we are party to a second amended and restated credit and security agreement  which has been amended on various occasions since its original execution in june as amended  our credit facility provides for a line of credit with asset based borrowing availability up to approximately million  stepping down to million by september   with interim decreases between such dates 
the amended facility has certain financial covenants as specified in the agreement 
the covenants include provisions that our leverage ratio not exceed to  that our current ratio must be greater than to or to depending on the time of year  and that our maximum ebitda loss and annual ebitda  both as defined in the agreement  comply with certain thresholds as described below 
the ebitda covenant requires that we do not exceed the allowable cumulative negative ebitda  as defined in the agreement  for the first nine months of fiscal  which is million as of december  and march  and million as of june  we are required to have a cumulative ebitda greater than or equal to our interest expense for the fiscal year ending september  ebitda  as defined in the agreement  is our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization plus an add back for stock based compensation expense and of the proceeds of our september stock offering or approximately million 
the amended facility provides for a variable interest rate margin of libor plus basis points through september  and thereafter at libor plus to basis points  depending upon our financial and operating performance 
we paid the lenders approximately million in amendment fees during fiscal the amended facility matures in may  but includes two one year renewal options  subject to lender approval 
as of september  and  we owed an aggregate of million and million  respectively  under our revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants 
advances under the facility accrued interest at a rate of and  as of september  and  respectively 
all indebtedness associated with our real estate holdings were repaid during the fiscal year ended september  as of september   the facility provided us with an additional borrowing availability of approximately million 
except as specified in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements  we have no material commitments for capital for the next 
table of contents months 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months  except for possible significant acquisitions 
contractual commitments and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  short term other long term operating year ending september  borrowings liabilities leases total amounts in thousands thereafter total estimates of future interest payments for short term borrowings have been excluded in the tabular presentation 
amounts due are contingent upon the outstanding balances and the variable interest rates 
as of september   the interest rate on our short term borrowings was 
the amounts included in other long term liabilities consist primarily of our estimated liability for claims on certain workers compensation insurance policies 
while we estimate the amount to be paid in excess of months  the ultimate timing of the payments is subject to certain variability 
accordingly  we have classified all amounts as due in the following year for the purposes of this table 
amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance  insurance  and real estate taxes 
these amounts are not a material component of operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our financial condition  liquidity  or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support  we do not engage in leasing  hedging  or research and development services  and we do not have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   all of our short term debt bore interest at a variable rate  tied to libor as a reference rate 
changes in the underlying libor interest rate or the spread charged under our performance pricing grid on our short term debt could affect our earnings 
for example  the basis point increase in the interest rate on our short term debt  as defined in our june amendment  is projected to result in an increase of approximately million in annual pre tax interest expense 
this estimated increase is based upon the outstanding balance of our short term debt as of september  and assumes no mitigating changes by us to reduce the outstanding balances  no additional interest assistance that could be received from vendors due to the interest rate increase  and no changes in the base libor rate 
products purchased from italian based manufacturers are subject to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate  which ultimately may impact the retail price at which we can sell such products 
accordingly  fluctuations in the value of the euro as compared with the us dollar may impact the price points at which we can profitably sell italian products  and such price points may not be competitive with other product lines in the united states 
accordingly  such fluctuations in exchange rates ultimately may impact the amount of revenue  cost of goods sold  cash flows  and earnings we recognize for italian product lines 
we cannot predict the effects of 
table of contents exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
in certain cases  we may enter into foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted purchases of boats and yachts from italian based manufacturers 
we are not currently engaged in foreign currency exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure 
if and when we do engage in foreign currency exchange hedging transactions  we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations
