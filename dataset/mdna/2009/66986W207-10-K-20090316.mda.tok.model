item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of operations for the years ended december   and you should read the following discussion together with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors  the introductory paragraph to part i  and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we consider our core business to be the ownership and operation of ambulatory surgery centers ascs 
as of december   we owned and operated ascs of which were jointly owned with physician partners 
we also own a equity interest in an asc that we plan to divest 
we also own other businesses including an optical laboratory  an optical products purchasing organization  and marketing products and services businesses and provide management services to two eye care practices 
financial highlights consolidated net revenue increased by to million 
surgical facilities net revenue increased by to million same facility surgical net revenue increased by to million 
operating income increased by to million 
we invested million to acquire majority interests in three ascs and million to acquire a interest in a call center and marketing solutions business 
operating cash flow of million 
asc strategy 
we measure the success of our asc strategy based on our ability to achieve or exceed the following key objectives acquire and develop new ascs 
we consider the acquisition and development of new ascs a key element of our long term growth strategy 
we currently have a development staff dedicated to identifying and analyzing acquisition and development opportunities 
strengthen and build relationships with existing and new physician partners 
our physician partners play a significant role in the success of our ascs 
we share a common goal with our physician partners which is to operate efficient  productive and profitable ascs 
our objective is to own more than of each asc but less than  however  in certain instances we may consider owning a minority interest 
continue to increase revenue and improve operating margins in our existing ascs 
the primary source of revenue at our ascs is derived from surgical procedures performed 
profitable growth within our existing ascs is determined by our ability to maximize efficiency and utilization  expand into medical procedures beyond eye care  and provide quality service to our physicians and their patients 
in addition to the above key asc objectives  our overall strategy also includes maintaining a strong balance sheet  continuing to grow the other segments of our business  and attracting and retaining employees to help us achieve our growth objectives 
uncertainties entering the current economic conditions in the united states  including the disruption in the financial markets that has severely reduced liquidity and credit availability  may adversely affect our results of operations  our financial condition and our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
the current economic recession and resulting unemployment could result in fewer procedures being performed at our ascs because patients may delay or cancel treatments 
further increases in unemployment if the economic recession continues could also result in fewer individuals being covered by employer sponsored health plans and more individuals being covered by lower paying government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid 
adverse economic conditions may also increase pressure on federal and state governments to contain or reduce reimbursements from medicare  medicaid and other programs 
to the extent that commercial payors are adversely affected by the economy  we may experience declines in commercial rates  a slow down in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect 
if the current turmoil in the credit markets continues  we may face difficulty renewing our credit facility  which currently expires in february we have million outstanding under our credit facility as of march  even if we are successful in renewing our credit facility  we will likely experience less favorable terms than the terms we are currently enjoying 
these revised terms will likely result in more limited borrowing availability and higher variable interest rates  which may limit our future acquisition and development activity and make it more expensive 
the current uncertainty around the refinancing of our credit facility will likely limit our ability to pursue acquisition and development activity in until we secure an extension with our lenders 
curtailing or eliminating our acquisition and development activities could adversely affect our financial results 
intangible assets  primarily in the form of goodwill  represent a significant portion of our total assets 
at december   intangible assets represented approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
the intangible asset value represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions and affiliations 
the value of these assets may not be realized 
we regularly  and at least annually  evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate all or a portion of the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its fair value  in which case an impairment charge to earnings may become necessary 
during  our estimate of the fair value of the asset declined 
while it was not necessary to record an impairment charge in  a continued decline in the fair value of this asset could lead us to determine that our intangible assets have suffered an impairment that requires us to write off a portion of the asset 
such a write off could significantly reduce our total assets  result in a substantial charge to earnings  and cause us to be in default under one or more covenants in our credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  net of allowances 
revenue from surgical procedures performed at our surgical facilities and patient visits to our eye care practices  net of contractual allowances and a provision for doubtful accounts  is recognized at the time the service is performed 
the contractual allowance is the difference between the fee we charge and the amount we expect to be paid by the patient or the applicable third party payor  which includes medicare and private insurance 
we base our estimates for the contractual allowance on the medicare reimbursement rates when medicare is the payor  our contracted rate with other third party payors or our historical experience when we do not have a specific medicare or contracted rate 
we base our estimate for doubtful accounts on the aging category and our historical collection experience 
while we believe that our contractual allowances are appropriate  if our actual contractual adjustments or bad debts differ from our estimates  our results of operations may be affected 
during the years ended december   and  we had no significant adjustments to contractual allowances related to prior periods 
our optical products purchasing organization negotiates buying discounts with optical product manufacturers 
the buying discounts and any handling charges billed to the members of the purchasing organization represent the revenue recognized 
product sales revenue from our optical laboratories and marketing products and services businesses  net of an allowance for returns and discounts  is recognized when the product is shipped or service is provided to the customer 
we base our estimates for sales returns and discounts on historical experience and have not experienced significant fluctuations between estimated and actual return activity and discounts given 
accounts receivable have been reduced by the reserves for estimated contractual allowances and doubtful accounts noted above 
asset impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of our fixed assets  goodwill and other noncurrent assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
our reported goodwill represents a significant portion of our total assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  annually and or when factors indicating impairment are present 
in conducting our impairment analysis  we utilize a market comparable and discounted cash flow approach 
differences in assumptions used under this approach could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
we currently believe we have adequate support for the carrying value of our goodwill based on assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
however  the analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
we will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist 
as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
we calculate fair value by using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the option 
we also estimate the expected service period over which our stock based awards will vest 
each of these assumptions  while reasonable  requires a certain degree of judgment and the fair value estimates could vary if actual results are materially different than those initially applied 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net revenue for the years indicated

surgical facilities 
the table below summarizes surgical facilities net revenue and procedures performed for and net revenues generated from surgical facilities are derived from the fees charged for the procedures performed in our ascs and through our laser services agreements 
our procedure volume is directly impacted by the number of ascs we operate  the number of excimer lasers in service  and their respective utilization rates 
surgical facilities net revenue increased by from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of a million increase from ascs we acquired or developed after january  new ascs and a million  or  increase from ascs that we owned for the entire comparable reporting periods same facility 
the increase in same facility net revenue was the result of a increase in the net revenue per procedure primarily due to a change in procedure mix offset by a decrease in the number of same facility procedures performed 
increase decrease dollars in thousands surgical facilities same facility net revenue of procedures new ascs net revenue of procedures asc closure laser terminations net revenue of procedures on october   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published their final rates for ascs 
the final rates include a decrease in the cataract rate in as with previous rate changes  the cataract rate change tends to determine the overall impact to us as the changes in the other procedure rates generally net each other out 
our preliminary estimate is that the final rates  based on our current procedure volumes and mix  will negatively impact annual surgical facilities net revenue by approximately million 
this does not include any potential wage index changes 
this revenue reduction approximates a impact on earnings per share 
the success of our business depends on our relationship with  and the success and efforts of  the physicians who perform surgical procedures at our ascs 
our revenue and profitability would decline if our relationship with key physicians deteriorated or those physicians reduced or eliminated their use of our ascs

cash flows provided by financing activities in included proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and issuance of stock to employees as part of our employee stock purchase plan offset by million of net payments under our credit facility and million of capital lease and other debt obligation payments 
on june   we received million of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of convertible subordinated notes as described below and in note and immediately used these proceeds to pay down debt under our revolving credit facility 
on june   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due june  the convertible notes 
proceeds from the convertible notes were used to pay down million of outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility and to fund the million net cost of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions described below 
interest on the convertible notes is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  commencing december  the convertible notes rank subordinate to our senior debt and rank pari passu or senior to all of our other subordinated indebtedness 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  or approximately shares per  principal amount of convertible notes 
the aggregate underwriting discount incurred with respect to the issuance of the convertible notes was million  which has been recorded as debt discount on our consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the convertible notes 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
apb fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
fsp apb requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
retrospective application to all periods presented is required except for instruments that were not outstanding during any of the periods that will be presented in the annual financial statements for the period of adoption but were outstanding during an earlier period 
the adoption of this fsp will add approximately million  million and million of non cash interest expense to our  and results of operations  respectively 
this will result in a reduction to net income of approximately million per diluted share  million per diluted share and million per diluted share in  and  respectively 
the adoption of this fsp will not have an impact on our cash flows 
the convertible notes include a net share settlement feature that requires us to settle conversion of the notes in cash up to the notes principal amount and settle any excess of the convertible notes conversion value above their principal amount by delivering shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of cash and common stock  at our option 
the conversion value of the convertible notes is equal to the market price of our common stock multiplied by the conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of convertible notes 
a market price that exceeds the conversion price of at the time of settlement results in excess conversion value above the original principal amount of  as a result of the net share settlement feature  we will be able to substantially reduce the number of shares of common stock issuable in the event of the conversion of the convertible notes by repaying principal in cash instead of issuing shares of common stock for that amount 
additionally  we will not be required to include the underlying shares of common stock in the calculation of our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for earnings per share until our common stock price exceeds 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge transaction with respect to our common stock the purchased call options with deutsche bank ag london the counterparty  an affiliate of the underwriter 
the purchased call options cover an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the cost of the call options totaled million 
in connection with the cost of the call options  we recorded a deferred tax asset of million to additional paid in capital to reflect the future cash benefit of the deduction over the term of the convertible notes 
we also sold warrants to the counterparty to purchase from us an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and received proceeds of million 
taken together  the call option and warrant agreements have the effect of increasing the effective conversion price of the convertible notes to per share 
for a further discussion of the convertible notes and the related call options and warrants  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all of our covenants 
effective february   we amended our credit facility  increasing the maximum commitment available under the facility from million to million and extending the expiration date to february  the maximum commitment available under the facility is the lesser of million or the maximum allowed under the calculated ratio limitations 
at december   we had approximately million of potential borrowing availability under our credit facility 
the amended credit agreement also includes an option allowing us to increase the maximum commitment available to million under certain conditions 
maximum borrowing availability and applicable interest rates under the facility are based on a ratio of our total indebtedness to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in the credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provided for temporary increases in this ratio through september  for purposes of calculating our maximum borrowing availability 
this ratio decreased following september  and reduced our maximum borrowing capacity 
interest on borrowings under the facility is payable at an annual rate equal to our lender s published base rate plus the applicable borrowing margin  ranging from to or libor plus a range from to  varying depending upon our ratios and ability to meet other financial covenants 
in addition  a fee ranging from 
to 
is charged on the unused portion of the commitment

under the terms of the consent  the assumption of total debt outside the credit facility for these acquisitions may not exceed million 
the weighted average interest rate on credit line borrowings at december  was 
during  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps protect us against certain interest rate fluctuations of the libor rate on million of our variable rate debt under our credit facility
