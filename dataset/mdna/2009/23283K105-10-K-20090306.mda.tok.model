item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
raw materials raw materials required to manufacture the celution system family of products and disposables are commonly available from multiple sources  and we have identified and executed supply agreements with our preferred vendors 
some specialty components are custom made for cytori  and we are dependent on the ability of these suppliers to deliver functioning parts in a timely manner to meet the ongoing demand for our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate quantities of the necessary raw materials supplies within a reasonable time or at commercially reasonable prices 
interruptions in supplies due to price  timing  or availability could have a negative impact on our ability to manufacture products 
intellectual property our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  including the celution system product platform  and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality agreements  licensing agreements and other agreements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our success also depends  in part  on our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others 
if we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third party patent  we could be required to pay damages  alter our products or processes  obtain licenses or cease certain activities 
to protect our proprietary medical technologies  including the celution system platform and scientific discoveries  cytori has has three issued us patents and six issued international patents 
in addition  we have patent applications pending worldwide 
we are seeking patents on methods and systems for processing adipose derived stem and regenerative cells  on use of adipose derived stem and regenerative cells for a variety of therapeutic indications  including their mechanisms of actions  and on compositions of matter than include adipose derived stem and regenerative cells 
in june  cytori was issued us patent no 
 the patent 
the patent is a foundational patent that protects the celution system technology for processing adipose tissue to obtain a diverse and mixed population of adipose derived stem and regenerative cells 
the patent establishes a strong barrier to entry against potential competitors and provides critical market protection while we seek regulatory approval in the united states 
in september  cytori was issued us patent no 
 the patent 
the patent protects cytori s celution system based methods of generating adipose tissue derived stem and regenerative cell enhanced fat grafts 
cell enhanced fat grafts may be used in a variety of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery applications  including breast reconstruction following partial mastectomy  breast implant salvage  as well as facial and other cosmetic applications 
in january  cytori was issued us patent no 
 the patent 
the patent protects combinations of the celution system output with various additives including  but not limited to  agents that promote cell differentiation such as growth factors  cytokines and protein  demineralized bone  tissue or tissue fragments  biological or artificial scaffolds  and immunosuppressive compounds 
these additives may be combined with the celution system output to increase efficacy  optimize or localize cell delivery  enhance specific cell properties or promote cell differentiation 
cytori has also received six international patents 
specifically  cytori has received patents in korea and singapore related to the company s current celution system devices  patents in korea and australia related to the company s stemsource cell bank  and patents in singapore and south africa related to the use of adipose derived stem and regenerative cells for cardiovascular therapy 
we are also the exclusive  worldwide licensee of the regents of the university of california s rights to us patent no 
 the patent  us patent no 
 the patent  six issued international patents and patent applications pending worldwide 
the patent covers isolated adipose derived stem cells that can differentiate into two or more of a variety of cell types 
the patent has been construed to cover isolated adipose derived stem cells in an environment substantially free of other cellular materials found in adipose tissue 
the patent  issued in december  covers a population of stem cells and progenitor cells which can be obtained from adipose tissue and which express certain combinations of cell surface markers 
specifically  the patent covers adipose derived stem and progenitor cells that express certain combinations of stro  cd  cd  cd  cdd  cd  cd  sh  cd  cd and low or undetectable levels of cd international patents related to isolated cells from adipose tissue have issued in australia  korea  russia  singapore and south africa 
we cannot assure that any of the pending patent applications will be issued  that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable  that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology 
furthermore  we cannot assure that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of our products or design around our patents 
us patent applications are not immediately made public  so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using 
patent law outside the united states is uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revisions 
the laws of some countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings 
opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the us it may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors patents that have been issued in countries other than the us this could result in substantial costs  divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have pending patent applications in europe  australia  japan  canada  china  korea  and singapore  among others 
patent litigation results in substantial costs to us and diversion of effort  and may be necessary from time to time to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
if our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the united states  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
in the fourth quarter of  the university of pittsburgh filed a lawsuit naming all of the inventors who had not assigned their ownership interest in us patent  to the university of pittsburgh  seeking a determination that its assignors  rather than the university of california s assignors  are the true inventors of patent no 
 if the university of pittsburgh wins the lawsuit  our license rights to this patent could be nullified or rendered non exclusive with respect to any third party that might license rights from the university of pittsburgh 
on august   the united states district court granted the university of pittsburgh s motion for summary judgment in part  determining that the university of pittsburgh s assignees were properly named as inventors on patent  and that all other inventorship issues shall be determined according to the facts presented at trial 
the trial was concluded in january and on june  the court signed its final order which we received on june  the court concluded that the university of pittsburgh s assignors were the sole inventors of the patent 
the court s decision terminated uc s rights to the patent 
upon review of the court s findings  we believe that the court s decision was in error and that work completed at the university of california was critical to obtaining this patent 
the uc assignors are appealing the decision 
if the uc assignors appeal of the court s decision is successful  uc s rights to the patent should be reinstated 
we are not named as a party to the lawsuit  but our president  marc hedrick  is one of the inventors identified on the patent and therefore is a named individual defendant 
due to our license obligations to uc relating to the patent and other uc patent applications  we have provided substantial financial and other assistance to the defense of the lawsuit 
since our current products and products under development do not practice the patent  our primary ongoing business activities and product development pipeline should not be affected by the court s decision 
although the patent is unrelated to our current products and product pipeline  we believe that the patent and or the other technology licensed from uc may have long term potential to be useful for future product developments  and so we have elected to support uc s legal efforts in the appeal of the court s final order 
we have incurred substantial legal costs as a result of the university of pittsburgh lawsuit to date  but we expect future costs will be minimal since the only remaining expense will be related to the final argument of the appeal 
as a named inventor on the patent  marc hedrick is entitled to receive from the uc up to of royalty payments made by a licensee us to uc 
this agreement was in place prior to his employment with us 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise 
we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent techniques  somehow gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise or disclose such trade secrets  or that we can ultimately protect our rights to such unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise 
we rely  in part  on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners  employees  advisors  vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
failure to obtain or maintain patent protection  or protect trade secrets  for any reason  third party claims against our patents  trade secrets or proprietary rights  or our involvement in disputes over our patents  trade secrets or proprietary rights  including involvement in litigation  could have a substantial negative effect on the results of our operations  cash flows and financial condition 
government regulation as newly developed medical devices  our celution system family of products must receive regulatory clearances or approvals from the european union  the fda and  from other state governments prior to their sale 
our current and future celution systems are or will be subject to stringent government regulation in the united states by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
the fda regulates the design development process  clinical testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  sale  distribution  and promotion of medical devices and drugs 
included among these regulations are pre market clearance and pre market approval requirements  design control requirements  and the quality system regulations good manufacturing practices 
other statutory and regulatory requirements govern  among other things  establishment registration and inspection  medical device listing  prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration  labeling and post market reporting 
the celution system family of products must also comply with the government regulations of each individual country in which the products are to be distributed and sold 
these regulations vary in complexity and can be as stringent  and on occasion even more stringent  than us fda regulations 
international government regulations vary from country to country and region to region 
for example  regulations in some parts of the world only require product registration while other regions countries require a complex product approval process 
due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking regulations that have recently been drafted and or implemented in various countries around the world  the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence 
therefore  the level of complexity and stringency is not known and may vary from country to country  creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process 
furthermore  government regulations can change with little to no notice and may result in up regulation of our product s  thereby  creating a greater regulatory burden for our cell processing and cell banking technology products 
the regulatory process can be lengthy  expensive  and uncertain 
before any new medical device may be introduced to the united states of america market  the manufacturer generally must obtain fda clearance or approval through either the k pre market notification process or the lengthier pre market approval application pma process 
it generally takes from three to months from submission to obtain k pre market clearance  although it may take longer 
approval of a pma could take four or more years from the time the process is initiated 
the k and pma processes can be expensive  uncertain  and lengthy  and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval 
we expect that some of our future products under development as well as olympus cytori s will be subject to the lengthier pma process 
securing fda clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda  and there can be no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval 
failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in application integrity proceedings  fines  recalls or seizures of products  injunctions  civil penalties  total or partial suspensions of production  withdrawals of existing product approvals or clearances  refusals to approve or clear new applications or notifications  and criminal prosecution 
medical devices are also subject to post market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury  and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
if safety or effectiveness problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may take steps to prevent or limit further marketing of the product 
additionally  the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the fda 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of products that could affect the safety or effectiveness or effect a major change in the intended use of a device that was either cleared through the k process or approved through the pma process may require further fda review through new k or pma submissions 
under the terms of our joint venture agreements with olympus we are the party with the primary responsibility for obtaining regulatory approvals to sell the olympus cytori  inc devices 
to date we have prepared and submitted multiple regulatory filings in the united states and europe related to various cell processing systems under development  which notably resulted in receipt of a ce mark on the celution system and k clearance in the united states for various related medical technologies  including an autologous blood processing device 
we must comply with extensive regulations from foreign jurisdictions regarding safety  manufacturing processes and quality 
these regulations  including the requirements for marketing authorization  may differ from the united states fda regulatory scheme 
specifically  in regard to our thin film product line in japan distributed by senko  we have been seeking marketing authorization from the japanese ministry of health  labour and welfare for the past four years  but have not obtained approvals yet 
staff as of december   we had employees  including part time and full time employees 
these employees are comprised of employees in manufacturing  employees in research and development  employees in sales and marketing and employees in management and finance and administration 
from time to time  we also employ independent contractors to support our operations 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage

risk factors in analyzing our company  you should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k 
factors that could adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock  include those discussed below  as well as those discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere throughout this annual report on form k 
we are subject to the following significant risks  among others we need to raise more cash in the very near term we have almost always had negative cash flows from operations 
our business will continue to result in a substantial requirement for research and development expenses for several years  during which we may not be able to bring in sufficient cash and or revenues to offset these expenses 
we are required to raise capital from one or more sources in the very near term to continue our operations at or close to the levels currently conducted 
we believe that without raising additional capital soon from accessible sources of financing  as well as an increase in capital from our operations  we will not otherwise have adequate funding to complete the development  pre clinical activities  clinical trials and marketing efforts required to successfully bring our current and future products to market 
in addition  if we are not successful in raising additional cash very soon we will be required to negotiate with general electric capital corporation gecc and silicon valley bank svb to obtain an amendment to the cash liquidity requirements of the loan and security agreement dated october  loan agreement 
if we are not successful in obtaining either the additional finding or cash liquidity relief then we will likely very soon thereafter be in default under the loan agreement 
if we are in default or if our senior secured lenders otherwise assert that there has been an event of default  they may seek to accelerate our senior secured loan and exercise their rights and remedies under the loan agreement  including the sale of our property and other assets 
in such event  we may be forced to file a bankruptcy case or have an involuntary bankruptcy case filed against us or otherwise liquidate our assets 
any of these events would have a substantial and material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  the value of our common stock and warrants and our ability to raise capital 
there is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed from additional debt or equity financing  arrangements with distribution partners  increased results of operations  or from other sources  or on terms attractive to us 
although we entered into a  loan facility with gecc and svb in october  we could not access the remaining  under that facility as we were not able satisfy certain financial conditions on or before december  the inability to obtain sufficient additional funds in the near term will at the least require us to significantly delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our research or product development  manufacturing operations  clinical or regulatory activities having a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
continued turmoil in the economy could harm our business negative trends in the general economy  including trends resulting from an actual or perceived recession  tightening credit markets  increased cost of commodities  including oil  actual or threatened military action by the united states and threats of terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  could cause a reduction of investment in and available funding for companies in certain industries  including ours 
our ability to raise capital has been and may continue to be adversely affected by current credit conditions and the downturn in the financial markets and the global economy 
we have never been profitable on an operational basis and expect significant operating losses for the next few years we have incurred net operating losses in each year since we started business 
as our focus on the celution system platform and development of therapeutic applications for its cellular output has increased  losses have resulted primarily from expenses associated with research and development activities and general and administrative expenses 
while we are implementing cost reduction measures where possible  we nonetheless expect to continue operating in a loss position on a consolidated basis and that recurring operating expenses will be at high levels for the next several years  in order to perform clinical trials  additional pre clinical research  product development  and marketing 
as a result of our historic losses  we have historically been  and continue to be  reliant on raising outside capital to fund our operations as discussed in the prior risk factor 
our business strategy is high risk we are focusing our resources and efforts primarily on development of the celution system family of products and the therapeutic applications of its cellular output  which requires extensive cash needs for research and development activities 
this is a high risk strategy because there is no assurance that our products will ever become commercially viable commercial risk  that we will prevent other companies from depriving us of market share and profit margins by selling products based on our inventions and developments legal risk  that we will successfully manage a company in a new area of business regenerative medicine and on a different scale than we have operated in the past operational risk  that we will be able to achieve the desired therapeutic results using stem and regenerative cells scientific risk  or that our cash resources will be adequate to develop our products until we become profitable  if ever financial risk 
we are using our cash in one of the riskiest industries in the economy strategic risk 
this may make our stock an unsuitable investment for many investors 
we must keep our joint venture with olympus operating smoothly our business cannot succeed on the currently anticipated timelines unless our joint venture collaboration with olympus goes well 
we have given olympus cytori  inc an exclusive license to manufacture future generation celution system devices 
if olympus cytori  inc does not successfully develop and manufacture these devices  we may not be able to commercialize any device or any therapeutic products successfully into the market 
in addition  future disruption or breakup of our relationship would be extremely costly to our reputation  in addition to causing many serious practical problems 
we and olympus must overcome contractual and cultural barriers 
our relationship is formally measured by a set of complex contracts  which have not yet been tested in practice 
in addition  many aspects of the relationship will be non contractual and must be worked out between the parties and the responsible individuals 
the joint venture is intended to have a long life  and it is difficult to maintain cooperative relationships over a long period of time in the face of various kinds of change 
cultural differences  including language barrier to some degree  may affect the efficiency of the relationship 
olympus cytori  inc is owned by us and owned by olympus 
by contract  each side must consent before any of a wide variety of important business actions can occur 
this situation possesses a risk of potentially time consuming and difficult negotiations which could at some point delay the joint venture from pursuing its business strategies 
olympus is entitled to designate the joint venture s chief executive officer and a majority of its board of directors  which means that day to day decisions which are not subject to a contractual veto will essentially be controlled by olympus 
in addition  olympus cytori  inc may require more money than its current capitalization in order to complete development and production of future generation devices 
if we are unable to help provide future financing for olympus cytori  inc  our relative equity interest in olympus cytori  inc 
may decrease 
furthermore  under a license joint development agreement among olympus cytori  inc  olympus  and us  olympus will have a primary role in the development of olympus cytori  inc s next generation devices 
although olympus has extensive experience in developing medical devices  this arrangement will result in a reduction of our control over the development and manufacturing of the next generation devices 
we have a limited operating history  operating results and stock price can be volatile like many life science companies our prospects must be evaluated in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by emerging companies and particularly by such companies in rapidly evolving and technologically advanced biotech and medical device fields 
due to limited operating history and the transition from the macropore biomaterials to the regenerative medicine business  comparisons of our year to year operating results are not necessarily meaningful and the results for any periods should not necessarily be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
all product revenues came from our spine and orthopedics implant product line  which we sold in may from time to time  we have tried to update our investors expectations as to our operating results by periodically announcing financial guidance 
however  we have in the past been forced to revise or withdraw such guidance due to lack of visibility and predictability of product demand 
we are vulnerable to competition and technological change  and also to physicians inertia we compete with many domestic and foreign companies in developing our technology and products  including biotechnology  medical device  and pharmaceutical companies 
many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  research and development  marketing  and personnel resources 
there is no assurance that our competitors will not succeed in developing alternative products that are more effective  easier to use  or more economical than those which we have developed or are in the process of developing  or that would render our products obsolete and non competitive 
in general  we may not be able to prevent others from developing and marketing competitive products similar to ours or which perform similar functions 
competitors may have greater experience in developing therapies or devices  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals  manufacturing and commercialization 
it is possible that competitors may obtain patent protection  approval  or clearance from the fda or achieve commercialization earlier than we can  any of which could have a substantial negative effect on our business 
finally  olympus and our other partners might pursue parallel development of other technologies or products  which may result in a partner developing additional products competitive with ours 
we compete against cell based therapies derived from alternate sources  such as bone marrow  umbilical cord blood and potentially embryos 
doctors historically are slow to adopt new technologies like ours  whatever the merits  when older technologies continue to be supported by established providers 
overcoming such inertia often requires very significant marketing expenditures or definitive product performance and or pricing superiority 
we expect physicians inertia and skepticism to also be a significant barrier as we attempt to gain market penetration with our future products 
we believe we will need to finance lengthy time consuming clinical studies so as to provide convincing evidence of the medical benefit in order to overcome this inertia and skepticism particularly in reconstructive surgery  cell preservation  the cardiovascular area and many other indications 
most products are pre commercialization  which subjects us to development and marketing risks we are in a relatively early stage of the path to commercialization with many of our products 
we believe that our long term viability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to develop commercial quality cell processing devices and useful procedure specific consumables  and to establish the safety and efficacy of our therapies through clinical trials and studies 
with our celution platform  we are pursuing new approaches for reconstructive surgery  preservation of stem and regenerative cells for potential future use  therapies for cardiovascular disease  gastrointestinal disorders and spine and orthopedic conditions 
there is no assurance that our development programs will be successfully completed or that required regulatory clearances or approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
there is no proven path for commercializing the celution system platform in a way to earn a durable profit commensurate with the medical benefit 
although we began to commercialize our reconstructive surgery products in europe and certain asian markets  and our cell banking products in japan  europe  and certain asian markets in  additional market opportunities for our products and or services are likely to be another two to five years away 
successful development and market acceptance of our products is subject to developmental risks  including failure of inventive imagination  ineffectiveness  lack of safety  unreliability  failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances or approvals  high commercial cost  preclusion or obsolescence resulting from third parties proprietary rights or superior or equivalent products  competition from copycat products  and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
there is no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop and commercialize our products  or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are less expensive or superior 
failure to successfully develop and market our products would have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the timing and amount of thin film revenues from senko are uncertain the sole remaining product line in our macropore biosurgery segment is our japan thin film business 
our right to receive royalties from senko  and to recognize certain deferred revenues  depends on the timing of mhlw approval for commercialization of the product in japan 
we have no control over this timing and our previous expectations have not been met 
also  even after commercialization  we will be dependent on senko  our exclusive distributor  to drive product sales in japan 
there is a risk that we could experience with senko some of the same problems we experienced in our previous relationship with medtronic  which was the exclusive distributor for our former bioresorbable spine and orthopedic implant product line 
we have limited manufacturing experience we have limited experience in manufacturing the celution system platform or its consumables at a commercial level 
with respect to our joint venture  although olympus is a highly capable and experienced manufacturer of medical devices  there can be no guarantee that the olympus cytori joint venture will be able to successfully develop and manufacture the next generation celution device in a manner that is cost effective or commercially viable  or that development and manufacturing capabilities might not take much longer than currently anticipated to be ready for the market 
although we have begun introduction of the celution and celution based stemsource cell bank in  we cannot assure that we will be able to manufacture sufficient numbers of such products to meet the demand  or that we will be able to overcome unforeseen manufacturing difficulties for these sophisticated medical devices  as we await the availability of the joint venture next generation celution device 
in the event that the olympus cytori joint venture is not successful  cytori may not have the resources or ability to self manufacture sufficient numbers of devices and consumables to meet market demand  and this failure may substantially extend the time it would take for us to bring a more advanced commercial device to market 
this makes us significantly dependant on the continued dedication and skill of olympus for the successful development of the next generation celution device 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights our success depends in part on whether we can maintain our existing patents  obtain additional patents  maintain trade secret protection  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
our amended regenerative cell technology license agreement with the regents of the university of california  or the uc  contains certain developmental milestones  which if not achieved could result in the loss of exclusivity or loss of the license rights 
the loss of such rights could impact our ability to develop certain regenerative cell technology products 
also  our power as licensee to successfully use these rights to exclude competitors from the market is untested 
in addition  further legal risk arises from a lawsuit filed by the university of pittsburgh in the united states district court  or the court  naming all of the inventors who had not assigned their ownership interest in patent  which we refer to as the patent  to the university of pittsburgh  seeking a determination that its assignors  rather than uc s assignors  are the true inventors of patent 
on june   we received the court s final order concluding that the university of pittsburgh s assignors were the sole inventors of the patent  which terminates uc s rights to this patent unless the decision of the court is overturned 
the uc assignors are appealing the court s decision and a notice of appeal was filed on july  we are the exclusive  worldwide licensee of the uc s rights under this patent in humans  which relates to adult stem cells isolated from adipose tissue that can differentiate into two or more of a variety of cell types 
if the uc assignors do not prevail on appeal  our license rights to this patent will be permanently lost 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will be approved or that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable 
there is also no assurance that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages  will not be challenged by any third parties  or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology 
furthermore  there can be no guarantee that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of our products  or design around our patents 
our commercial success will also depend  in part  on our ability to avoid infringing on patents issued to others 
if we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third party patent  we could be required to pay damages  alter our products or processes  obtain licenses  or cease certain activities 
if we are required in the future to obtain any licenses from third parties for some of our products  there can be no guarantee that we would be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
us patent applications are not immediately made public  so we might be surprised by the grant to someone else of a patent on a technology we are actively using 
as noted above as to the university of pittsburgh lawsuit  even patents issued to us or our licensors might be judicially determined to belong in full or in part to third parties 
litigation  which would result in substantial costs to us and diversion of effort on our part  may be necessary to enforce or confirm the ownership of any patents issued or licensed to us  or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
if our competitors claim technology also claimed by us and prepare and file patent applications in the united states of america  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
any such litigation or interference proceeding  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming 
in addition to patents  which alone may not be able to protect the fundamentals of our regenerative cell business  we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise 
our intended future cell related therapeutic products  such as consumables  are likely to fall largely into this category 
we rely  in part  on confidentiality agreements with our partners  employees  advisors  vendors  and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise 
there can be no guarantee that these agreements will not be breached  or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
failure to obtain or maintain patent protection  or protect trade secrets  for any reason or third party claims against our patents  trade secrets  or proprietary rights  or our involvement in disputes over our patents  trade secrets  or proprietary rights  including involvement in litigation  could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property in countries outside the united states intellectual property law outside the united states is uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revisions 
the laws of some countries do not protect our patent and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states laws 
this is particularly relevant to us as we currently conduct most of our clinical trials outside of the united states 
third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings 
opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the us it may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors patents that have been issued in countries other than the us this could result in substantial costs  divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have pending patent applications in europe  australia  japan  canada  china  korea  and singapore  among others 
we and olympus cytori  inc are subject to intensive fda regulation as newly developed medical devices  celution system family of products must receive regulatory clearances or approvals from the fda and  in many instances  from non us and state governments prior to their sale 
the celution system family of products is subject to stringent government regulation in the united states by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
the fda regulates the design development process  clinical testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  sale  distribution  and promotion of medical devices and drugs 
included among these regulations are pre market clearance and pre market approval requirements  design control requirements  and the quality system regulations good manufacturing practices 
other statutory and regulatory requirements govern  among other things  establishment registration and inspection  medical device listing  prohibitions against misbranding and adulteration  labeling and post market reporting 
the regulatory process can be lengthy  expensive  and uncertain 
before any new medical device may be introduced to the united states of america market  the manufacturer generally must obtain fda clearance or approval through either the k pre market notification process or the lengthier pre market approval application  or pma  process 
it generally takes from three to months from submission to obtain k pre market clearance  although it may take longer 
approval of a pma could take four or more years from the time the process is initiated 
the k and pma processes can be expensive  uncertain  and lengthy  and there is no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval 
we expect that some of our future products under development as well as olympus cytori s will be subject to the lengthier pma process 
securing fda clearances and approvals may require the submission of extensive clinical data and supporting information to the fda  and there can be no guarantee of ultimate clearance or approval 
failure to comply with applicable requirements can result in application integrity proceedings  fines  recalls or seizures of products  injunctions  civil penalties  total or partial suspensions of production  withdrawals of existing product approvals or clearances  refusals to approve or clear new applications or notifications  and criminal prosecution 
medical devices are also subject to post market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury  and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
if safety or effectiveness problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may take steps to prevent or limit further marketing of the product 
additionally  the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing and promotion of devices for indications or uses that have not been cleared or approved by the fda 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the necessary k clearances or pma approvals to market and manufacture our other products in the united states of america for their intended use on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals  the loss of previously received clearances or approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
to sell in international markets  we will be subject to intensive regulation in foreign countries in cooperation with our distribution partners  we intend to market our current and future products both domestically and in many foreign markets 
a number of risks are inherent in international transactions 
in order for us to market our products in europe  canada  japan and certain other non us jurisdictions  we need to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals or clearances and must comply with extensive regulations regarding safety  manufacturing processes and quality 
for example  we still have not obtained regulatory approval for our thin film products in japan 
these regulations  including the requirements for approvals or clearances to market  may differ from the fda regulatory scheme 
international sales also may be limited or disrupted by political instability  price controls  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in all of the countries where we intend to market our products  or that we will not incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or clearances  or that we will be able to successfully commercialize current or future products in various foreign markets 
delays in receipt of approvals or clearances to market our products in foreign countries  failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the future loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
changing  new and or emerging government regulations government regulations can change without notice 
given that fact that cytori operates in various international markets  our access to such markets could change with little to no warning due to a change in government regulations that suddenly up regulate our product s and create greater regulatory burden for our cell therapy and cell banking technology products 
due to the fact that there are new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking regulations that have recently been drafted and or implemented in various countries around the world  the application and subsequent implementation of these new and emerging regulations have little to no precedence 
therefore  the level of complexity and stringency is not known and may vary from country to country  creating greater uncertainty for the international regulatory process 
health insurance reimbursement risks new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking technologies  such as those provided by the celution system family of products  may have difficulty or encounter significant delays in obtaining health care reimbursement in some or all countries around the world due to the novelty of our cell therapy and cell banking technology and subsequent lack of existing reimbursement schemes pathways 
therefore  the creation of new reimbursement pathways may be complex and lengthy with no assurances that such reimbursements will be successful 
the lack of health insurance reimbursement or reduced or minimal reimbursement pricing may have a significant impact on our ability to successfully sell our cell therapy and cell banking technology product s into a county or region 
market acceptance of new technology new and emerging cell therapy and cell banking technologies  such as those provided by the celution system family of products  may have difficulty or encounter significant delays in obtaining market acceptance in some or all countries around the world due to the novelty of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies 
therefore  the market adoption of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies may be slow and lengthy with no assurances that significant market adoption will be successful 
the lack of market adoption or reduced or minimal market adoption of our cell therapy and cell banking technologies may have a significant impact on our ability to successfully sell our product s into a country or region 
we and or the joint venture have to maintain quality assurance certification and manufacturing approvals the manufacture of our celution system will be  and the manufacture of any future cell related therapeutic products would be  subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and distribution partners 
the manufacture of devices and products for human use is subject to regulation and inspection from time to time by the fda for compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  requirements  as well as equivalent requirements and inspections by state and non us regulatory authorities 
there can be no guarantee that the fda or other authorities will not  during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities  identify what they consider to be deficiencies in our compliance with qsrs or other requirements and request  or seek remedial action 
failure to comply with such regulations or a potential delay in attaining compliance may adversely affect our manufacturing activities and could result in  among other things  injunctions  civil penalties  fda refusal to grant pre market approvals or clearances of future or pending product submissions  fines  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  and criminal prosecution 
there can be no assurance after such occurrences that we will be able to obtain additional necessary regulatory approvals or clearances on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances  or the loss of previously received approvals or clearances could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on a few key officers our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and other key scientific staff  including christopher j 
calhoun  our chief executive officer  and marc hedrick  md  our president 
we rely upon them for strategic business decisions and guidance 
we believe that our future success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend in large part upon whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key scientific staff or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel and develop expertise as needed could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not have enough product liability insurance the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of our regenerative cell products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us  our distribution partners  or licensees 
there can be no guarantee that our clinical trial and commercial product liability insurance is adequate or will continue to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost  if at all 
a product liability claim  product recall  or other claim  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  well publicized claims could cause our stock to fall sharply  even before the merits of the claims are decided by a court 
our charter documents contain anti takeover provisions and we have adopted a stockholder rights plan to prevent hostile takeovers our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that could prevent or delay the acquisition of the company by means of a tender offer  proxy contest  or otherwise 
they could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of cytori  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders 
such provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change of control of cytori and consequently could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
also  in we adopted a stockholder rights plan of the kind often referred to as a poison pill 
the purpose of the stockholder rights plan is to prevent coercive takeover tactics that may otherwise be utilized in takeover attempts 
the existence of such a rights plan may also prevent or delay a change in control of cytori  and this prevention or delay adversely affect the market price of our shares 
we pay no dividends we have never paid in the past  and currently do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future

item legal proceedings from time to time  we have been involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
as of december   we were not a party to any material legal proceeding 
we are not formally a party to the university of pittsburgh patent litigation 
however  we are responsible for reimbursing certain related litigation costs 
on june   we received the court s final order concluding that the university of pittsburgh s assignors were the sole inventors of the patent 
the uc assignors are appealing the court s decision 
since our current products and products under development do not practice the patent  our primary ongoing business activities and product development pipeline should not be affected by the court s decision 
although the patent is unrelated to our current products and product pipeline  we believe that the patent and or the other technology licensed from uc may have long term potential to be useful for future product developments  and so we have elected to support uc s legal efforts in the appeal of the court s final order

liquidity we incurred losses of   and  for the years ended december    and respectively 
we have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  additionally  we have used net cash of   and  to fund our operating activities for years ended december    and  respectively 
to date these operating losses have been funded primarily from outside sources of invested capital 
during  we initiated our commercialization activities while simultaneously pursuing available financing sources to support operations and growth 
we have had  and continue to have  an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations 
however  our ability to raise capital has been adversely affected by current credit conditions and the downturn in the financial markets and the global economy 
accordingly  the combination of these facts raises substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise outside capital in the near term  we will be required to significantly reduce our research  development  and administrative operations  including reduction of our employee base  in order to offset the lack of available funding 
we are pursuing financing opportunities in both the private and public debt and equity markets as well as through strategic corporate partnerships 
we have an established history of raising capital through these platforms  and we are currently involved in negotiations with multiple parties 
our efforts in to raise capital have taken longer than we initially anticipated 
we were however  successful in august  and raised approximately  in gross proceeds from a private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants with an original exercise price of per share to a syndicate of investors including olympus corporation  who acquired  unregistered shares and  common stock warrants in exchange for  of the total proceeds raised 
in october  we entered into a secured loan agreement with general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank lenders to borrow up to  an initial term loan of  less fees and expenses  was funded on october  we could not access the remaining  under this facility as we were not able to meet certain financial prerequisites that had been established by the lenders 
we expect to continue to utilize our cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through at least the next few months  subject to minimum cash and cash liquidity requirements of the loan and security agreement with the lenders  which requires that we maintain at least three months of cash on hand to avoid an event of default under the loan and security agreement 
we continue to seek additional cash through product revenues  strategic collaborations  and future sales of equity or debt securities 
although there can be no assurance given  we hope to successfully complete one or more additional financing transactions and corporate partnerships in the near term 
without this additional capital  current working capital and cash generated from sales and containment of operating costs will not provide adequate funding for research  sales and marketing efforts  clinical and preclinical trials  and product development activities at their current levels 
if such efforts are not successful  we will need to significantly reduce or curtail our research and development and other operations and this could negatively affect our ability to achieve corporate growth goals 
specifically  we have prepared an operating plan plan that calls for us to reduce operations to focus almost entirely on the supply of current products to existing or new distribution channels 
this plan would result in reductions to our current sales and marketing headcount total headcount was at december  as well as a reduction in manufacturing headcount total headcount of at december  
in addition  as part of the plan  there would be minimal expenditures for ongoing scientific research  product development or clinical research 
this impacts research and development headcount total headcount was at december   external subcontractor expenditures  capital outlay and general and administrative expenditures related to the supervision of such activities 
in parallel  we would significantly reduce administrative staff the general and administrative headcount was at december  and salaries consistent with the overall reduction in scope of operations 
in aggregate  such reductions could result in eliminations of roles for the majority of the company s current staff and the deferral or elimination of all ongoing development projects until such time that cash resources were available from operations or outside sources to re establish development and growth plans 
management is currently reviewing contractual obligations related to the pre clinical and clinical commitments along with minimum purchase requirements to include deferral of such commitments as part of this plan 
while management is actively pursuing its near term financial and strategic alternatives it is also  in parallel  continuing to evaluate the timing of implementation of the alternative operating plan and the initiation of the identified reductions 
based on the impact of the reductions described above and a full year impact of other actions taken by management in q and q of  the cash operating requirements in the near term would be reduced to a range of to million per month 
overview cytori therapeutics  inc manufactures  develops  and internationally commercializes innovative medical technologies  which allow physicians to practice regenerative medicine 
the company s main product is the celution system  which is the first and only broadly available device that provides clinical grade autologous stem and regenerative cells in real time 
this device processes a patient s own stem and regenerative cells at the bedside so their cells may be redelivered during the same surgical procedure 
our commercialization model is based on the sale of the celution system and generating recurring revenue thereafter from the sale of single use consumables used in every patient procedure and on sales of related instrumentation and ancillary products 
commercial activities are currently focused on marketing the celution cell processing system and related family of products across three areas 
the first is cosmetic and reconstructive surgery in europe and asia pacific 
the second is to fulfill the demand among physicians in europe and asia pacific for access to clinical grade stem and regenerative cells 
the third is to market the celution based stemsource cell bank worldwide to hospitals and tissue banks so they can in turn offer patients the opportunity to cyropreserve their own adipose derive stem and regenerative cells 
the more therapeutic applications that are developed for the celution system and its cellular output  the more opportunities we will have to offer the celution system and related consumable sets to hospitals  clinics  and physicians 
for this reason  we are developing and allowing others to develop additional applications for the celution system  which include cardiovascular disease  for which two human clinical trials are underway  renal failure  orthopedic damage  gastrointestinal disorders  and pelvic health conditions  among others 
in the first quarter of  we launched the first commercial generation celution system product platform 
throughout the year and into  we broadened our commercialization efforts and expanded our network of distribution partners 
this included the opening of a sales and training center in europe designed to educate physicians on the technology and its benefits  as well as promote sales within the region 
to support future sales efforts  we initiated a patient post marketing study in europe last year  with the goal of expanding claims and seeking reimbursement for the use of the celution system in post partial mastectomy defect reconstruction 
final results from this study are expected to be reported in in partnership with olympus corporation  we made significant progress during toward finalizing the second commercial generation celution system 
currently  we manufacture the first commercial generation celution system and consumables at our corporate headquarters and provide all servicing for the device through our regional offices 
also during  we were granted several us and international patents and patent allowances  which cover various aspects of the celution system technology and applications of the celution system output 
these developments further protect our proprietary rights and competitive position 
lastly  during we continued enrollment of our european cardiovascular disease clinical trials  which represent our most advanced product pipeline application 
enrollment for both studies should be completed in with results available as early as our strategy for the future  in this current financial environment with a new product that has multiple potential applications  is to focus the majority of our financial resources on activities that will promote immediate sales of the celution system 
in europe and asia pacific  this entails continued investment in the restore ii study to support reimbursement and includes maintaining our level of investment into sales and marketing activities 
in the united states  we are continuing to seek regulatory and marketing approval of the celution system family of products 
we expect to finalize our us regulatory and clinical development strategy in the market for clinical grade cells requires substantially fewer resources as the majority of the commercialization efforts are assumed by our distribution partners 
this allows us to further expand the installed base of celution systems 
we expect the breadth of these applications for which the device is used in this market will grow significantly as physicians continue to adopt cell based regenerative medicine into their treatment strategies based on the availability of safe clinical grade cells at the point of care 
the stemsource cell bank business is being offered through our commercialization partner green hospital supply in japan  korea  taiwan and thailand  and is being offered by ge healthcare in select european countries 
we believe growth in the cell bank business in within asia pacific will be driven by hospitals where a device is already installed as part of an investigator initiated study  and where physicians are already familiar with the use of the system and its benefits 
the commercialization activities are performed predominantly by our distributors  however we continue to serve in a consulting capacity to assist as needed in sales and service 
coinciding with our increased investment in commercial activities is a planned reduction in preclinical research and cardiovascular disease development expenses 
because we have passed the feasibility stage and are now manufacturing commercial products  we have less reliance going forward on basic and preclinical development activities 
preclinical research will continue at a base level required to fulfill demands for potential partnerships  expanding intellectual property  and supporting commercial activities 
for cardiovascular disease  we plan to complete enrollment in these studies  report data in late and or early at which point we will either seek a co development partner or pursue further development in a measured way until such time as we have the adequate financial resources to invest in pivotal european studies and us clinical trials 
cytori s business objectives for and beyond include the following exceed global celution system and stemsource sales target of million in expand global distribution network in europe and asia pacific and related sales impact expand celution system product claims to include general and plastic surgery procedures expand celution system reimbursement in europe substantial reduction in total operating expenses complete enrollment of restore ii in the second quarter of report preliminary restore ii results as early as the fourth quarter of on patients who have been followed for six months at the time of analysis introduce complementary cosmetic and reconstructive surgery products in the us in the third quarter of finalize us regulatory and clinical development and regulatory strategy complete enrollment in cardiovascular studies precise apollo and report results in olympus partnership on november   we entered into a strategic development and manufacturing joint venture agreement and other related agreements jv agreements with olympus corporation olympus 
as part of the terms of the jv agreements  we formed a joint venture  olympus cytori  inc the joint venture  to develop and manufacture future generation devices based on our celution system platform 
under the joint venture agreements olympus paid  for its interest in the joint venture 
moreover  olympus simultaneously entered into a license joint development agreement with the joint venture and us to develop a second generation commercial system and manufacturing capabilities 
we licensed our device technology  including the celution system platform and certain related intellectual property  to the joint venture for use in future generation devices 
these devices will process and purify adult stem and regenerative cells residing in adipose fat tissue for various therapeutic clinical applications 
in exchange for this license  we received a interest in the joint venture  as well as an initial  payment from the joint venture  the source of this payment was the  contributed to the joint venture by olympus 
moreover  upon receipt of a ce mark for the first generation celution system platform in january  we received an additional  development milestone payment from the joint venture 
put calls and guarantees the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to cytori at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
as of november   the fair value of the put was determined to be  at december  and  the fair value of the put was  and  respectively 
fluctuations in the put value are recorded in the statements of operations as a component of change in fair value of option liabilities 
the fair value of the put has been recorded as a long term liability on the balance sheet in the caption option liability 
the following assumptions were employed in estimating the value of the put december  december  november  expected volatility of cytori expected volatility of the joint venture bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori bankruptcy threshold for cytori probability of a change of control event for cytori expected correlation between fair values of cytori and the joint venture in the future risk free interest rate the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put and mark it to market each quarter until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
the joint venture currently has exclusive access to our technology for the development  manufacture  and supply of the devices second generation and beyond for all therapeutic applications 
once a later generation celution system is developed and approved by regulatory agencies  the joint venture would sell such systems exclusively to us at a formula based transfer price  we have retained marketing rights to the second generation devices for all therapeutic applications of adipose stem and regenerative cells 
we have worked closely with olympus team of scientists and engineers to design the future generations of the celution system so that it will contain certain product enhancements and that can be manufactured in a streamlined manner 
in august  we entered into a license and royalty agreement with the joint venture which provides us the ability to commercially launch the celution system platform earlier than we could have otherwise done so under the terms of the joint venture agreements 
the royalty agreement allows for the sale of the cytori developed celution system platform  including the celution crs and celution mb  until such time as the joint venture s products are commercially available for the same market served by the cytori platform  subject to a reasonable royalty that will be payable to the joint venture for all such sales 
we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
other related party transactions in a separate agreement entered into on february   we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate a commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a  payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus could conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us for the therapeutic area up to december  when this exclusive right expired 
accordingly  on december   we recognized  as other development revenue and reduced our deferred revenues  related party balance for the same amount 
on february   we agreed to sell  shares of unregistered common stock to green hospital supply  inc for  cash  or per share  in a private stock placement 
on february   we closed the first half of the private placement with green hospital supply  inc and received  we closed the second half of the private placement on april  and received the second payment of in august  we received an additional  from olympus in a private placement of  unregistered shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an original exercise price of per share 
the purchase price was per unit with each unit consisting of one share and warrant coverage 
the warrant is exercisable anytime after february  and will expire on august  macropore biosurgery spine and orthopedic products by selling substantially all of our spine and orthopedic surgical implant business to kensey nash corporation in the second quarter of  we have completed our transition away from the bioresorbable product line for which we were originally founded 
thin film japan distribution agreement in  we sold the majority of our thin film business to mast biosurgery ag 
we retained all rights to thin film business in japan subject to a purchase option of mast  which expired in may  and we received back from mast a license of all rights to thin film technologies in the spinal field  exclusive at least until  and the field of regenerative medicine  non exclusive on a perpetual basis 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a distribution agreement with senko medical trading company 
under this agreement  we granted to senko an exclusive license to sell and distribute certain thin film products in japan 
specifically  the license covers thin film products with the following indications anti adhesion  soft tissue support  and minimization of the attachment of soft tissues 
the distribution agreement with senko commences upon commercialization 
commercialization will occur when one or more thin film product registrations are completed with the japanese ministry of health  labour and welfare  or mhlw 
following commercialization  the distribution agreement has a duration of five years and is renewable for an additional five years after reaching mutually agreed minimum purchase guarantees 
we received a  upfront license fee from senko 
we have recorded the  received as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated condensed balance sheet 
half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
under the distribution agreement  we will also be entitled to earn additional payments from senko based on achieving defined milestones 
on september   we notified senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product 
as a result  we became entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  which we received in october and recorded as a component of deferred revenues 
we did not recognize any development revenues with respect to senko during the year ended december  to date we have recognized a total of  in development revenues    and  for the years ended december     and  respectively related to this agreement 
capital requirements and liquidity research and development for the celution system product platform and clinical applications of adipose derived stem and regenerative cell therapies has been and will continue to be very costly 
as a result  we expect to continue incurring losses in the near future 
we will focus our efforts on substantially reducing research and development expenses  pre clinical research  and general and administrative activities throughout as we conclude our clinical trials initiated in and complete the transition to a focus on manufacturing and sale of our celution crs for reconstructive surgery 
over of our research and development expenses of  were related to our regenerative cell technology business  and the majority of those were related to optimizing the celution crs for reconstructive surgery research and development of cardiovascular disease applications 
we believe research and development expenses will be substantially reduced in see additional discussion of liquidity at the beginning of management discussion and analysis 
we plan to fund this anticipated research and development from existing cash and short term investments  payments  if any  related to potential celution system platform commercialization partnerships  payments  if any  related to potential biomaterial divestitures  potential research grants  and sale of common stock through potential future financings

as of december  we had  of shipped product orders that did not reach final destination until revenue for these items is expected to be recognized in the quarter ending march  additionally  we deferred  as an estimate of the fair value of future deliverables from product revenue and will recognize when such deliverables have been provided or earned 
spine and orthopedic product revenues represent sales of bioresorbable implants used in spine and orthopedic surgical procedures 
we sold substantially all of this line of business to kensey nash in may the future we expect to continue to generate regenerative cell technology product revenues during from celution crs and consumable sales in europe and we expect to generate product revenues from stemsource cell bank sales in japan through our distribution partner green hospital supply  inc we expect to have product revenues related to our macropore biosurgery segment again when commercialization of the thin film products in japan occurs and we begin thin film shipments to senko  pending regulatory approval

during the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision of   and  respectively  related to excess and slow moving inventory 
in  this inventory was produced in anticipation of stocking orders from medtronic which did not materialize 
the future 
we expect to see a nominal decrease of gross profit margin for the regenerative cell technology segment as the balance of production inventory on hand that was previously expensed as research and development cost decreases 
we expect to incur costs related to our macropore products if and when commercialization is achieved for our japan thin film product line

during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus 
the revenue recognized in was a result of completing two study milestones in the first quarter 
additionally  we recognized  of other development revenue that relates to the agreement we entered into on february   in which we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate a commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a  payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus could conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us for the therapeutic area up to december  when this exclusive right expired 
accordingly  on december   we recognized  as other development revenue and reduced our deferred  related party balance for the same amount 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus 
the revenue recognized in was a result of completing a pre clinical study milestone in the second quarter and completing a development milestone in the third quarter 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus 
the revenue recognized in was a result of completing a pre clinical study milestone in the first quarter  receiving a ce mark for the celution system  and reaching three additional milestones in the fourth quarter 
one milestone related to the completion of a pre clinical study while the other two were results of product development efforts 
the research grant revenue related to our agreement with the national institutes of health nih 
under this arrangement  the nih reimbursed us for qualifying expenditures related to research on adipose derived cell therapy for myocardial infarction 
to receive funds under the grant arrangement  we were required to i demonstrate that we incurred qualifying expenses  as defined in the grant agreement between the nih and us  ii maintain a system of controls  whereby we can accurately track and report all expenditures related solely to research on adipose derived cell therapy for myocardial infarction  and iii file appropriate forms and follow appropriate protocols established by the nih 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in expenditures  of which  were qualified 
we recognized a total of  in revenues for the year ended december   which included allowable grant fees as well as cost reimbursements 
our work under this nih agreement was completed in  as a result  there were no comparable revenues or costs in and macropore biosurgery thin film under a distribution agreement with senko we are entitled to earn payments based on achieving the following defined milestones upon notifying senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product  we were entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  we so notified senko on september   received payment in october of  and recorded deferred revenues of  as of december   of the amount deferred  we have recognized development revenues of   in   in   prior to 
in addition  we also received a  license fee that was recorded as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying balance sheet 
because the  in license fees is potentially refundable  such amounts will not be recognized as revenues until the refund rights expire 
specifically  half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
we are also entitled to a non refundable payment of  once we achieve commercialization 
the future we expect to recognize additional development revenues from our regenerative cell technology segment during  as the anticipated completion for the next phase of our joint venture and other olympus product development performance obligations is in if we are successful in achieving certain milestone points related to these activities  we may recognize approximately  in revenues in the exact timing of when amounts will be reported in revenue will depend on internal factors for instance  our ability to complete certain contributions and obligations that we have agreed to perform as well as external considerations  including obtaining certain regulatory clearances and or approvals related to the celution system 
the cash for these contributions and obligations was received when the agreement was signed and no further related cash payments will be made to us 
we will continue to recognize revenue from the thin film development work we are performing on behalf of senko  based on the relative fair value of the milestones completed as compared to the total efforts expected to be necessary to obtain regulatory clearance from the mhlw 
we are still awaiting regulatory clearance from the mhlw in order for initial commercialization to occur 
accordingly  we expect to recognize approximately  consisting of  in deferred revenues plus a non refundable payment of  to be received upon commercialization in revenues associated with this milestone arrangement if and when regulatory approval is achieved 
moreover  we expect to recognize  per year associated with deferred senko license fees over a three year period following commercialization  if achieved  as the refund rights associated with the license payment expire 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  regulatory fees  the purchase of laboratory supplies  pre clinical studies  and clinical studies

these expenses  in conjunction with our continued development efforts related to our celution system  result primarily from the broad expansion of our research and development efforts enabled by the funding we received from olympus in and and from other investors during the last few years 
labor related expenses  not including share based compensation  decreased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the decrease in headcount for our research and development department as a result of achievement of commercialization and transfer of employees from research and development to the manufacturing department 
professional services expense increased by  from to  primarily due to increased use of consultants and temporary labor during the year ended december  pre clinical and clinical study expense decreased by  from to primarily due to a reduction in pre clinical study activity as we focus on our clinical studies 
additionally  although the overall cost of a clinical trial is generally higher than for a preclinical study  such costs are typically spread out over a longer period of time 
expenses for supplies increased by  from to  primarily due to timing of use of inventory supplies for research purposes and purchases of production supplies prior to the related product line commercialization 
professional services expense including pre clinical and clinical study costs decreased by  from to  of which  was attributed to a decrease in pre clinical and clinical study expense primarily due to a transition in focus from pre clinical studies to clinical studies 
rent and utilities expense decreased by  from to primarily due the termination of leases at our top gun location in san diego  ca 
these decreases were offset by an increase in travel expense of  and an increase in repair and maintenance expense of  from to expenditures related to the joint venture with olympus  which are included in the variation analysis above  include costs that are necessary to support the commercialization of future generation devices  including the next generation celution device

stock based compensation expenses as noted previously  we adopted sfas r on january  stock based compensation expenses include charges related to options issued to employees  directors and non employees 
prior to january   the stock based compensation expenditures connected to options granted to employees and directors in their capacity as board members is the difference between the exercise price of the stock based awards and the market value of our underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
unearned employee stock based compensation is amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options  which generally vest over a four year period from the date of grant 
from january  onwards  we adopted fasb no 
revised  share based payments 
under this pronouncement  we measure stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of any awards granted to our employees 
such expense is recognized over the period of time that employees provide service to us and earn all rights to the awards 
stock based compensation expense related to options to purchase common stock issued to non employees is the fair value of the stock on the date of issuance  even if such stock contains sales restrictions

there will be no further charges related these modifications 
in the first quarter of  we issued  shares of restricted common stock to a non employee scientific advisor 
the stock is restricted in that it cannot be sold for a specified period of time 
there are no vesting requirements

change in fair value of option liabilities the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of option liabilities for the years ended december   and years ended change in fair value of option liability 
change in fair value of put option liability total change in fair value of option liabilities 
we granted olympus an option to acquire  shares of our common stock in the exercise price of the option shares was per share 
we had accounted for this grant as a liability because had the option been exercised  we would have been required to deliver listed shares of our common stock to settle the option shares 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the fair value of this option was re measured at the end of each quarter  using the black scholes option pricing model  with the movement in fair value reported in the statement of operations as a change in fair value of option liabilities 
this option expired unexercised on december  in reference to the joint venture  the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to us at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
the value of the put has been classified as a liability 
the valuations of the put were completed using an option pricing theory based simulation analysis ie  a monte carlo simulation 
the valuations are based on assumptions as of the valuation date with regard to the market value of cytori and the estimated fair value of the joint venture  the expected correlation between the values of cytori and the joint venture  the expected volatility of cytori and the joint venture  the bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori  the bankruptcy threshold for cytori  the probability of a change of control event for cytori  and the risk free interest rate

no additional gains will be recognized related to either sale 
financing items the following table summarizes interest income  interest expense  and other income and expenses for the years ended december   and years ended interest income interest expense other income expense total interest income decreased for the year december  as compared to the same period in due to a decrease in interest rates and cash balance available for investment 
interest income increased in as compared to due to a larger balance of funds available for investment  as a result of i the sale of common stock and common stock warrants under the shelf registration statement in february  ii proceeds from the common stock private placement to green hospital supply  inc in april  and iii proceeds from the sale of our bioresorbable spine and orthopedic surgical implant product line to kensey nash in may interest expense increased in as compared to due to interest incurred as well as non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount associated with a new term loan 
in october  we entered into a secured loan agreement with general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank lenders to borrow up to  an initial term loan of  less fees and expenses  funded on october  interest expense decreased in as compared to due to the lower principal balances on our long term equipment financed borrowings  which were fully repaid in the changes in other income expense in  and resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the future 
interest income earned in will be dependent on our levels of funds available for investment as well as general economic conditions 
we expect interest expense to increase in as we continue to repay the term loan balance 
equity loss from investment in joint venture the following table summarizes equity loss from investment in joint venture for the years ended december   and years ended equity loss from investment in joint venture the losses relate entirely to our equity interest in the joint venture  which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
the future 
we do not expect to recognize significant losses from the activities of the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
over the next two to three years  the joint venture is expected to incur labor costs related to the development of our second generation commercial system as well as general and administrative expenses  offset by royalty and other revenue expected to be generated by our current celution crs and future generation devices 
though we have no obligation to do so  we plan to contribute funding to the joint venture to cover any costs should the joint venture deplete its cash balance 
liquidity and capital resources short term and long term liquidity the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures at december   and years ended cash and cash equivalents short term investments  available for sale total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  available for sale current assets current liabilities working capital in order to continue the operations of our regenerative cell business at or near current levels  we will need to raise additional capital in the very near term 
during  we initiated our commercialization activities while simultaneously pursuing available financing sources to support operations and growth 
we have had  and continue to have  an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations 
however  our ability to raise capital has been adversely affected by current credit conditions and the downturn in the financial markets and the global economy 
accordingly  the combination of these facts raises substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise outside capital in the near term  we will be required to significantly reduce our research  development  and administrative operations  including reduction of our employee base  in order to offset the lack of available funding 
we are pursuing financing opportunities in both the private and public debt and equity markets as well as through strategic corporate partnerships 
we have an established history of raising capital through these platforms  and we are currently involved in negotiations with multiple parties 
our efforts in to raise capital have taken longer than we initially anticipated 
however  in august  we raised approximately  in gross proceeds from a private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants with an original exercise price of per share to a syndicate of investors including olympus corporation  who acquired  unregistered shares and  common stock warrants in exchange for  of the total proceeds raised 
in october  we entered into a secured loan agreement with general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank lenders to borrow up to  an initial term loan of  less fees and expenses  was funded on october  we could not access the remaining  under this facility as we were not able to meet certain financial prerequisites that had been established by the lenders 
we expect to continue to utilize our cash and cash equivalents to fund operations through at least the next few months  subject to minimum cash and cash liquidity requirements of the loan and security agreement with the lenders  which requires that we maintain at least three months of cash on hand to avoid an event of default under the loan and security agreement 
we continue to seek additional cash through product revenues  strategic collaborations  and future sales of equity or debt securities 
although there can be no assurance given  we hope to successfully complete one or more additional financing transactions and corporate partnerships in the near term 
without this additional capital  current working capital and cash generated from sales and containment of operating costs will not provide adequate funding for research  sales and marketing efforts  clinical and preclinical trials  and product development activities at their current levels 
if such efforts are not successful  we will need to significantly reduce or curtail our research and development and other operations and this could negatively affect our ability to achieve corporate growth goals 
specifically  we have prepared an operating plan plan that calls for us to reduce operations to focus almost entirely on the supply of current products to existing or new distribution channels 
this plan would result in reductions to our current sales and marketing headcount total headcount was at december  as well as a reduction in manufacturing headcount total headcount of at december  
in addition  as part of this plan  there would be minimal expenditures for ongoing scientific research  product development or clinical research 
this impacts research and development headcount total headcount was at december   external subcontractor expenditures  capital outlay and general and administrative expenditures related to the supervision of such activities 
in parallel  we would significantly reduce administrative staff the general and administrative headcount was at december  and salaries consistent with the overall reduction in scope of operations 
in aggregate  such reductions could result in eliminations of roles for the majority of the company s current staff and the deferral or elimination of all ongoing development projects until such time that cash resources were available from operations or outside sources to re establish development and growth plans 
management is currently reviewing contractual obligations related to the pre clinical and clinical commitments along with minimum purchase requirements to include deferral of such commitments as part of this plan 
while management is actively pursuing its near term financial and strategic alternatives it is also  in parallel  continuing to evaluate the timing of implementation of the alternative operating plan and the initiation of the identified reductions 
based on the impact of the reductions described above contemplated by the plan and a full year impact of other actions taken by management in q and q of  the cash operating requirements in the near term would be reduced to a range of to million per month

in connection with the loan facility  on october   we issued to each lender a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on october  our cash requirements for and beyond will depend on numerous factors  including our successful restructuring of our operating plan and business strategies as described above 
under our previous operating plan  we would have expected to incur research and development expenses at high levels in our regenerative cell platform for an extended period of time 
under the new plan  we will seek to reduce these expenditures as much as possible

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
while our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made  our actual results may differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
if results differ materially from our estimates  we will make adjustments to our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment 
we believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies 
these are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and  as a result  could have the greatest impact on our future financial results 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from a number of different sources  including but not limited to fees for achieving certain defined milestones under research and or development arrangements 
product sales  and payments under license or distribution agreements 
a number of our revenue generating arrangements are relatively simple in nature  meaning that there is little judgment necessary with regard to the timing of when we recognize revenues or how such revenues are presented in the financial statements 
however  we have also entered into more complex arrangements  including but not limited to our contracts with olympus  senko  and the nih 
moreover  some of our non recurring transactions  such as our disposition of the majority of our thin film business to mast  contain elements that relate to our revenue producing activities 
as a result  some of our most critical accounting judgments relate to the identification  timing  and presentation of revenue related activities 
these critical judgments are as follows multiple element arrangements some of our revenue generating arrangements contains a number of distinct revenue streams  known as elements 
for example  our distribution agreement with senko contains direct or indirect future revenue streams related to a distribution license fee which was paid at the outset of the arrangement  milestone payments for achieving commercialization of the thin film product line in japan  training for representatives of senko  sales of thin film products to senko  and royalty payments on future product sales made by senko to its end customers 
emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  governs whether each of the above elements in the arrangement should be accounted for individually  or whether the entire contract should be treated as a single unit of accounting 
eitf indicates that individual elements may be separately accounted for only when the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer  there is objective evidence of the fair value of the remaining undelivered elements  and if the arrangement contains a general right of return related to any products delivered  delivery of the remaining goods and services is probable and within the complete control of the seller 
in the case of the senko distribution agreement  we determined that a the milestones payments for achieving commercialization and b the future sale of thin film products to senko were separable elements 
that is  each of these elements  upon delivery  will have stand alone value to senko and there will be objective evidence of the fair value of any remaining undelivered elements at that time 
the arrangement does not contain any general right of return  and so this point is not relevant to our analysis 
on the other hand  we concluded that a the upfront distribution license fee  b the revenues from training for representatives of senko  and c the payments in the form of royalties on future product sales are not separable elements under eitf in arriving at our conclusions  we had to consider whether our customer  senko  would receive stand alone value from each delivered element 
we also  in some cases  had to support the fair value of certain undelivered elements 
finally  we had to make assumptions about how the non separable elements of the arrangement are earned  particularly the estimated period over which senko will benefit from the arrangement refer to the recognition discussion below for further background 
we also agreed to perform elements under the november  agreements we signed with olympus  including granting the joint venture which olympus is considered to control an exclusive and perpetual manufacturing license to our device technology  including the celution system platform and certain related intellectual property  and completing certain pre clinical and clinical studies  assisting with product development and seeking regulatory approval and or clearances toward commercialization of the celution system platform 
we concluded that the license and development services must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
in reaching this conclusion  we determined that the license would not have stand alone value to the joint venture 
this is because cytori is the only party that could be reasonably expected to perform certain development contributions and obligations  including product development assistance  certain agreed regulatory filings and generally associated pre clinical and clinical studies necessary for the joint venture to derive value from the license 
recognition besides determining whether to account separately for components of a multiple element arrangement  we also use judgment in determining the appropriate accounting period in which to recognize revenues that we believe a have been earned and b are realizable 
the following describes some of the recognition issues we have considered during the reporting period 
product revenues o we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of arrangement 
revenue for these product sales will be recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for celution crs system sales to customers who arrange for and manage the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs eitf 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title of risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent use or resale of our product 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with eitf when more than one element such as product maintenance or technical support services are included in an arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
deferred service revenue is recognized ratably over the period the services are provided 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for delivered elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and applying historical loss rates to the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customer were to deteriorate  resulting in tehir inability to pay their accounts when due  additional reserves might be required 
before the disposal of substantially all of our bioresorbable spine and orthopedic product line in may  we sold our non thin film macropore biosurgery products to medtronic  inc  a related party 
we recognized revenue on product sales to medtronic upon shipment of ordered products to medtronic  as title and risk of loss were transferred at that point 
in may  we sold to kensey nash our intellectual property rights and tangible assets related to our bioresorbable spine and orthopedic product line 
upfront license fees milestones o as part of the senko distribution agreement  we received an upfront license fee upon execution of the arrangement  which  as noted previously  was not separable under eitf accordingly  the license has been combined with the development milestones element to form a single accounting unit 
this single element of  in fees includes  which is potentially refundable 
we have recognized  and will continue to recognize  the non contingent fees allocated to this combined element as revenues as we complete each of the performance obligations associated with the milestones component of this combined deliverable 
note that the timing of when we have recognized revenues to date does not correspond with the cash we received upon achieving certain milestones 
for example  the first such milestone payment for  became payable to us when we filed a commercialization application with the japanese regulatory authorities 
however  we determined that the payment received was not commensurate with the level of effort expended  particularly when compared with other steps we believe are necessary to commercialize the thin film product line in japan 
accordingly  we did not recognize the entire  received as revenues  but instead all but  of this amount is classified as deferred revenues 
approximately   in   in   in and  in has been recognized to date as development revenues based on our estimates of the level of effort expended for completed milestones as compared with the total level of effort we expect to incur under the arrangement to successfully achieve regulatory approval of the thin film product line in japan 
these estimates were subject to judgment and there may be changes to these estimates as we continue to seek regulatory approval 
in fact there can be no assurance that commercialization in japan will ever be achieved  as we have yet to receive approval from the mhlw for the thin film product 
o we also received upfront fees as part of the olympus arrangements although  unlike in the senko agreement  these fees were non refundable 
specifically  in exchange for an upfront fee  we granted the joint venture an exclusive  perpetual license to certain of our intellectual property and agreed to perform additional development activities 
this upfront fee has been recorded in the liability account entitled deferred revenues  related party  on our consolidated balance sheet 
similar to the senko agreement  we expect to recognize revenues from the combined license development accounting unit as we perform our obligations under the agreements  as this represents our final obligation underlying the combined accounting unit 
specifically  we have recognized revenues from the license development accounting unit using a proportional performance methodology  resulting in the de recognition of amounts recorded in the deferred revenues  related party  account as we complete various milestones underlying the development services 
proportional performance methodology was elected due to the nature of our development obligations and efforts in support of the joint venture jv  including product development activities  and regulatory efforts to support the commercialization of the jv products 
the application of this methodology uses the achievement of r d milestones as outputs of value to the jv 
we received up front  non refundable payments in connection with these development obligations  which we have broken down into specific r d milestones that are definable and substantive in nature  and which will result in value to the jv when achieved 
revenue will be recognized as the above mentioned r d milestones are completed 
we established the r d milestones based upon our development obligations to the jv and the specific r d support activities to be performed to achieve these obligations 
our r d milestones consist of the following primary performance categories product development  regulatory approvals  and generally associated pre clinical and clinical trials 
within each category are milestones that take substantive effort to complete and are critical pieces of the overall progress towards completion of the next generation product  which we are obligated to support within the agreements entered into with olympus 
to determine whether substantive effort was required to achieve the milestones  we considered the external costs  required personnel and relevant skill levels  the amount of time required to complete each milestone  and the interdependent relationships between the milestones  in that the benefits associated with the completion of one milestone generally support and contribute to the achievement of the next 
determination of the relative values assigned to each milestone involved substantial judgment 
the assignment process was based on discussions with persons responsible for the development process and the relative costs of completing each milestone 
we considered the costs of completing the milestones in allocating the portion of the deferred revenues  related party account balance to each milestone 
management believes that  while the costs incurred in achieving the various milestones are subject to estimation  due to the high correlation of such costs to outputs achieved  the use of external contract research organization cro costs and internal labor costs as the basis for the allocation process provides management the ability to accurately and reasonably estimate such costs 
the accounting policy described above could result in revenues being recorded in an earlier accounting period than had other judgments or assumptions been made by us 
government grants o we are at times eligible to receive grants from the nih related to various research activities 
revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants are recorded in compliance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
in accordance with the criteria established by these eitf issues  the company records grant revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  research arrangements we have with nih  as well commercial enterprises such as olympus and senko  are considered a key component of our central and ongoing operations 
moreover  the government obtains rights under the arrangement  in the same manner but perhaps not to the same extent as a commercial customer that similarly contracts with us to perform research activities 
for instance  the government and any authorized third parties may use our federally funded research and or inventions without payment of royalties to us 
accordingly  the inflows from such arrangements are presented as revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
our policy was to recognize revenues under the nih grant arrangement as the lesser of i qualifying costs incurred and not previously recognized  plus our allowable grant fees for which we are entitled to funding or ii the amount determined by comparing the outputs generated to date versus the total outputs expected to be achieved under the research arrangement 
goodwill impairment testing in late  we purchased stemsource  inc and recognized over  in goodwill associated with the acquisition  of which  remains on our balance sheet as of december  as required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we must test this goodwill at least annually for impairment as well as when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
moreover  this testing must be performed at a level of the organization known as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is at least the same level as a company s operating segments  and sometimes even one level lower 
our two reporting units are the same as our two operating segments 
specifically  the process for testing goodwill for impairment under sfas involves the following steps company assets and liabilities  including goodwill  are allocated to each reporting unit for purposes of completing the goodwill impairment test 
the carrying value of each reporting unit that is  the sum of all of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit is then compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill may be impaired additional testing is required 
the application of the goodwill impairment test involves a substantial amount of judgment 
for instance  sfas requires that assets and liabilities be assigned to a reporting unit if both of the following criteria are met the asset will be employed in or the liability relates to the operations of a reporting unit 
the asset or liability will be considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
we developed mechanisms to assign company wide assets like shared property and equipment  as well as company wide obligations such as borrowings under our ge loan facility  to our two reporting units 
in some cases  certain assets were not allocable to either reporting unit and were left unassigned 
in  all goodwill that previously had been assigned to our macropore biosurgery reporting unit was derecognized as a result of our sale of our spine and orthopedic product line to kensey nash 
accordingly  there was no need to test this component of our business for goodwill impairment in and also  in  we completed our goodwill impairment testing for our regenerative cell technology reporting unit using an income based approach incorporating discounted projections of estimated future cash flows as well as a market based approach 
we concluded that the fair value of this unit exceeded its carrying value  and that none of our reported goodwill was impaired 
again  the manner in which we assigned assets  liabilities  and goodwill to our reporting units  as well as how we determined the fair value of such reporting units  involves significant uncertainties and estimates 
the judgments employed may have an effect on whether a goodwill impairment loss is recognized 
variable interest entity olympus cytori joint venture fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
evaluating whether an entity is a vie and determining its primary beneficiary involves significant judgment 
we concluded that the olympus cytori joint venture was a vie based on the following factors under fin r  an entity is a vie if it has insufficient equity to finance its activities 
we recognized that the initial cash contributed to the joint venture formed by olympus and cytori  would be completely utilized by the first quarter of moreover  it was highly unlikely that the joint venture would be able to obtain the necessary financing from third party lenders without additional subordinated financial support such as personal guarantees by one or both of the joint venture stockholders 
accordingly  the joint venture will require additional financial support from olympus and cytori to finance its ongoing operations  indicating that the joint venture is a vie 
in fact  we contributed  and  in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively  to fund the joint venture s ongoing operations 
moreover  olympus has a contingent put option that would  in specified circumstances  require cytori to purchase olympus s interests in the joint venture for a fixed amount of  accordingly  olympus is protected in some circumstances from absorbing all expected losses in the joint venture 
under fin r  this means that olympus may not be an at risk equity holder  although olympus clearly has decision rights over the operations of the joint venture 
because the joint venture is undercapitalized  and because one of the joint venture s decision makers may be protected from losses  we have determined that the joint venture is a vie under fin r 
as noted previously  a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is defined in fin r as the entity that would absorb the majority of the vie s expected losses or be entitled to receive the majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
significant judgment was involved in determining the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
under fin r  we believe that olympus and cytori are de facto agents and  together  will absorb more than of the joint venture s expected losses and residual returns 
ultimately  we concluded that olympus  and not cytori  was the party most closely related with the joint venture and  hence  its primary beneficiary 
our conclusion was based on the following factors the business operations of the joint venture will be most closely aligned to those of olympus ie  the manufacture of devices 
olympus controls the board of directors  as well as the day to day operations of the joint venture 
the application of fin r involves substantial judgment 
had we consolidated the joint venture  though  there would be no effect on our net loss or shareholders equity at december  or for the year then ended 
however  certain balance sheet and income statement captions would have been presented in a different manner 
for instance  we would not have presented a single line item entitled investment in joint venture in our balance sheet but  instead  would have performed a line by line consolidation of each of the joint venture s accounts into our financial statements 
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december  to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
we increased our valuation allowance by approximately  during the year ended december  the valuation allowance includes approximately  related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which  if realized  will eventually be credited to equity and not to income 
at december   we had federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and respectively  if unused 
at december   we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal credits will begin to expire in  if unused  and  of the state credits will begin to expire in if unused 
the remaining state credits carry forward indefinitely 
in addition  we had a foreign tax loss carryforward of  and  in japan and italy  respectively 
the internal revenue code limits the future availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation s ownership resulting in a change of control of cytori 
due to prior ownership changes as defined in irc section  a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are limited in their annual utilization 
in september  we experienced an ownership change for purposes of the irc section limitation 
as of december   these pre change net operating losses and credits are fully available 
additionally  in when we purchased stemsource  we acquired federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
this event triggered an ownership change for purposes of irc section it is estimated that the pre change net operating losses and credits will be fully available by we have completed an update to our irc section study analysis through april  we have not had any additional ownership changes based on this study

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
on january   we adopted certain provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides a single definition of fair value and a common framework for measuring fair value as well as new disclosure requirements for fair value measurements used in financial statements 
sfas applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing pronouncements  accordingly  the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances 
in february  the fasb issued staff position effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp no 
 which delayed the adoption date until january  for non financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis  such as goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we do not expect the adoption of the sfas for non financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on january   we also adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
however  we have not elected to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value under the provisions of this standard 
in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf states that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the guidance is effective for all periods beginning after december   which we adopted effective january  the adoption of eitf did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for annual periods beginning on or after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements of statement no 
to account for all business combinations using the acquisition method formerly the purchase method and for an acquiring entity to be identified in all business combinations 
however  the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for acquisitions made on or after the first day of annual periods beginning on or after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas r will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
eitf requires collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently in the process evaluating whether the adoption of eitf will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides a framework for evaluating the terms of a particular instrument to determine whether such instrument is considered a derivative financial instrument 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and must be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity as of the date of adoption 
we anticipate the adoption of eitf will result is the recognition of a liability for the warrants issued in august as part of our private placement of common stock of approximately million and a corresponding increase in stockholders deficit as of january  future changes in the fair value of the warrant liability will be recognized as a component of earnings loss

the intent of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under statement and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fasb statement no 
r  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
this fsp is effective for our interim and annual financial statements beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on the our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure we are not subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term obligations as they bear a fixed rate of interest 
our exposure relates primarily to short term investments  including funds classified as cash equivalents 
investment securities are subject to market rate risk as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from the levels prevailing at december   for example  and assuming average investment duration of seven months  the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce such risks by generally limiting the maturity date of such securities  diversifying our investments and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
while we do not always have the intent  we do currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity and  therefore  believe that reductions in the value of such securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in interest rates would  of course  affect the interest income we earn on our cash balances after re investment 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our activities in europe and japan 
transaction gains or losses resulting from cash balances and revenues have not been significant in the past and we are not engaged in any hedging activity in the euro  the yen or other currencies 
based on our cash balances and revenues derived from markets other than the united states for the year ended december   a hypothetical adverse change in the euro or yen against the us dollar would not result in a material foreign currency exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such sales denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under our japanese thin film agreement with senko  we would receive payments in the nature of royalties based on senko s net sales  which would be yen denominated
