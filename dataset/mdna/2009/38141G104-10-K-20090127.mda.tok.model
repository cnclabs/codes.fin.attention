table of contents executive overview our diluted earnings per common share were for  compared with for return on average tangible common shareholders equity was and return on average common shareholders equity was for as of november  book value per common share was  an increase of compared with the end of  and our tier ratio was 
during the fourth quarter of  we raised billion in equity  comprised of a billion public common stock sale  a billion preferred stock and warrant issuance to berkshire hathaway inc and certain affiliates and a billion preferred stock and warrant issuance under the us department of the treasury s us treasury tarp capital purchase program 
total assets were billion at the end of the year  a decrease of compared with the end of during the fourth quarter of  the firm became a bank holding company regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board 
our results for reflected a particularly difficult operating environment  including significant asset price declines  high levels of volatility and reduced levels of liquidity  particularly in the fourth quarter 
in addition  credit markets experienced significant dislocation between prices for cash instruments and the related derivative contracts and between credit indices and underlying single names 
net revenues in trading and principal investments were significantly lower compared with  reflecting significant declines in fixed income  currency and commodities ficc  principal investments and equities 
the decrease in ficc primarily reflected losses in credit products  which included a loss of approximately billion net of hedges related to non investment grade credit origination activities and losses from investments  including corporate debt and private and public equities 
results in mortgages included net losses of approximately billion on residential mortgage loans and securities and approximately billion on commercial mortgage loans and securities 
interest rate products  currencies and commodities each produced particularly strong results and net revenues were higher compared with during  although client driven activity was generally solid  ficc operated in a challenging environment characterized by broad based declines in asset values  wider mortgage and corporate credit spreads  reduced levels of liquidity and broad based investor deleveraging  particularly in the second half of the year 
the decline in principal investments primarily reflected net losses of billion from corporate principal investments and million from real estate principal investments  as well as a million loss from our investment in the ordinary shares of industrial and commercial bank of china limited icbc 
in equities  the decrease compared with particularly strong net revenues in reflected losses in principal strategies  partially offset by higher net revenues in our client franchise businesses 
commissions were particularly strong and were higher than during  equities operated in an environment characterized by a significant decline in global equity prices  broad based investor deleveraging and very high levels of volatility  particularly in the second half of the year 
return on average tangible common shareholders equity rote is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders equity 
see results of operations financial overview below for further information regarding our calculation of rote 
before we became a bank holding company  we were subject to capital guidelines as a consolidated supervised entity cse that were generally consistent with those set out in the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards issued by the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii 
we currently compute and report our consolidated capital ratios in accordance with the basel ii requirements  as applicable to us when we were regulated as a cse  for the purpose of assessing the adequacy of our capital 
under the basel ii framework as it applied to us when we were regulated as a cse  our tier ratio equals tier capital divided by total risk weighted assets rwas 
we are currently working with the federal reserve board to put in place the appropriate reporting and compliance mechanisms and methodologies to allow reporting of the basel i capital ratios as of the end of march see equity capital below for a further discussion of our tier ratio 

table of contents net revenues in investment banking also declined significantly compared with  reflecting significantly lower net revenues in both financial advisory and underwriting 
in financial advisory  the decrease compared with particularly strong net revenues in reflected a decline in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions 
the decrease in underwriting primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in debt underwriting  primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance and mortgage related activity  reflecting difficult market conditions 
net revenues in equity underwriting were slightly lower compared with  reflecting a decrease in industry wide equity and equity related offerings 
our investment banking transaction backlog at the end of was significantly lower than it was at the end of net revenues in asset management and securities services increased compared with securities services net revenues were higher  reflecting the impact of changes in the composition of securities lending customer balances  as well as higher total average customer balances 
asset management net revenues increased slightly compared with during the year  assets under management decreased billion to billion  due to billion of market depreciation  primarily in equity assets  partially offset by billion of net inflows 
given the difficult market conditions  and in particular  the challenging liquidity and funding environment during  we focused on reducing concentrated risk positions  including our exposure to leveraged loans and real estate related loans 
we believe that the strength of our capital position will enable us to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise in our business  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally

our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not 

table of contents business environment our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate 
during the first half of  global economic growth slowed as the us entered a recession 
despite the weakness in the us and other major economies  growth in most emerging markets remained solid  which contributed to a dramatic increase in commodity prices as well as increased inflation

table of contents certain risk factors that may affect our businesses we face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses  including market  liquidity  credit  operational  legal and regulatory risks 
for a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks  see risk management below 
a summary of the more important factors that could affect our businesses follows below 
for a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our businesses  see risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k 
market conditions and market risk 
our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate 
overall  during fiscal  the business environment has been extremely adverse for many of our businesses and there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  high global gross domestic product growth  transparent  liquid and efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence  stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation  interest rates  exchange rate volatility  default rates or the price of basic commodities  outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability  corporate  political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets  natural disasters or pandemics  or a combination of these or other factors 
our businesses and profitability have been and may continue to become adversely affected by market conditions in many ways  including the following many of our businesses  such as our merchant banking businesses  our mortgages  leveraged loan and credit products businesses in our ficc segment  and our equity principal strategies business  have net long positions in debt securities  loans  derivatives  mortgages  equities including private equity and most other asset classes 
in addition  many of our market making and other businesses in which we act as a principal to facilitate our clients activities  including our specialist businesses  commit large amounts of capital to maintain trading positions in interest rate and credit products  as well as currencies  commodities and equities 
because nearly all of these investing and trading positions are marked to market on a daily basis  declines in asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings  unless we have effectively hedged our exposures to such declines 
in certain circumstances particularly in the case of leveraged loans and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets  it may not be possible or economic to hedge such exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets 
sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets  which may make it very difficult to sell  hedge or value such assets 
the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk weighted assets which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs 
our cost of obtaining long term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads 
credit spreads are influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness 
widening credit spreads  as well as significant declines in the availability of credit  have adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may continue to do so 
we fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing commercial paper  promissory notes and long term debt  or by obtaining bank loans or lines of credit 
we seek to finance many of our assets  including our less liquid assets  on a secured basis  including by entering into repurchase agreements 
disruptions in the credit markets make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses 
if our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund 
table of contents our operations at a higher cost  these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding  both of which could reduce our profitability  particularly in our businesses that involve investing  lending and taking principal positions  including market making 
our investment banking business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by market conditions 
poor economic conditions and other adverse geopolitical conditions can adversely affect and have adversely affected investor and ceo confidence  resulting in significant industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of financial advisory transactions  which could continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins 
in addition  our clients engaging in mergers and acquisitions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions 
the lack of available credit and the increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size  volume and timing of our clients merger and acquisition transactions particularly large transactions 
because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues are derived from our participation in large transactions  a decline in the number of large transactions would adversely affect our investment banking business 
certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities  and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses 
on the other hand  increased volatility  while it can increase trading volumes and spreads  also increases risk as measured by var and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market making and proprietary businesses or cause us to reduce the size of these businesses in order to avoid increasing our var 
limiting the size of our market making positions and investing businesses can adversely affect our profitability 
we receive asset based management fees based on the value of our clients portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and  in some cases  we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments 
declines in asset values reduce the value of our clients portfolios or fund assets  which in turn reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets 
market uncertainty  volatility and adverse economic conditions  as well as declines in asset values  may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts or affect our ability to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients and result in reduced net revenues  principally in our asset management business 
to the extent that clients do not withdraw their funds  they may invest them in products that generate less fee income 
concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making  proprietary trading  investing  block trading  merchant banking  underwriting and lending businesses 
this risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital to facilitate customer driven business 
concerns about financial institution profitability and solvency as a result of general market conditions  particularly in the credit markets  together with the forced merger or failure of a number of major commercial and investment banks have at times caused a number of our clients to reduce the level of business that they do with us  either because of concerns about the safety of their assets held by us or simply arising from a desire to diversify their risk or for other reasons 
some clients have withdrawn some of the funds held at our firm or transferred them from deposits with gs bank usa to other types of assets in many cases leaving those assets in their brokerage accounts held with us 
some counterparties have at times refused to enter into certain derivatives and other long term transactions with us or have requested additional collateral 
these instances were more prevalent during periods when the lack of confidence in financial institutions was most widespread and have become significantly less frequent in recent months 

table of contents liquidity risk 
liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets  an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries  an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments  or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us  or even by the perception among market participants that we  or other market participants  are experiencing greater liquidity risk 
the ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in financial institutions has increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of our traditional sources of liquidity  including both secured and unsecured borrowings 
in particular  in the latter half of  we were unable to raise significant amounts of long term unsecured debt in the public markets  other than as a result of the issuance of securities guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic under the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
it is unclear when we will regain access to the public long term unsecured debt markets on customary terms or whether any similar program will be available after the tlgp s scheduled june expiration 
the financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are increasingly complex  as we employ structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves  and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress 
our investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets  which could restrict liquidity for our positions 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time  as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis 
in addition  financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set off rights or the right to require additional collateral  including in difficult market conditions  which could further impair our access to liquidity 
our credit ratings are important to our liquidity 
a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position  increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts 
under these provisions  counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with goldman sachs or require us to post additional collateral 
termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements 
for a discussion of downgrades to our ratings that occurred in december and of the potential impact on goldman sachs of a further reduction in our credit ratings  see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below 
group inc has guaranteed the payment obligations of goldman  sachs co 
gs co  goldman sachs bank usa gs bank usa and goldman sachs bank europe plc gs bank europe  subject to certain exceptions  and has pledged significant assets to gs bank usa to support its obligations to gs bank usa 
these guarantees may require group inc to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when group inc is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations 

table of contents credit risk 
the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years  as have the breadth and size of the entities to which we have credit exposures 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
a failure of a significant market participant  or even concerns about a default by such an institution  could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect us 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
in addition  deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes 
a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results 
while in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral for counterparties that experience financial difficulty  disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets 
default rates  downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral increase significantly in times of market stress and illiquidity 
as part of our clearing business  we finance our client positions  and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries  countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee  particularly as new business initiatives lead us to transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and new markets 
we have experienced  due to competitive factors  pressure to extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take 
in particular  corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments 
operational risk 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor  on a daily basis  a very large number of transactions  many of which are highly complex  across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
these transactions  as well as the information technology services we provide to clients  often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  internet  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
industry consolidation  whether among market participants or financial intermediaries  increases the risk of operational failure as disparate complex systems need to be integrated  often on an accelerated basis 
furthermore  the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents  exchanges and clearing houses increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution may cause an industry wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business 

table of contents legal and regulatory risk 
we are subject to extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the world 
several of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements and  as a bank holding company  we are subject to minimum capital standards and a minimum tier leverage ratio on a consolidated basis 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
recent market disruptions have led to numerous proposals for significant additional regulation of the financial services industry 
these regulations could limit our business activities  increase compliance costs and  to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms  make it more difficult for us to distinguish ourselves from competitors 
substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us  which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects 
as a bank holding company  we will be subject to capital requirements based on basel i as opposed to the requirements based on basel ii that applied to us as a cse 
complying with these requirements may require us to liquidate assets or raise capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors 
in addition  failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our status as a bank holding company and the operation of our lending and other businesses through gs bank usa subject us to additional regulation and limitations on our activities  as described in regulation banking regulation in part i  item of our annual report on form k  as well as some regulatory uncertainty as we apply banking regulations and practices to many of our businesses 
the application of these regulations and practices may present us and our regulators with new or novel issues 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high 
our experience has been that legal claims by customers and clients increase in a market downturn 
in addition  employment related claims typically increase in periods when we have reduced the total number of employees 
for a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures  see use of estimates below 

table of contents critical accounting policies fair value the use of fair value to measure financial instruments  with related unrealized gains or losses generally recognized in trading and principal investments in our consolidated statements of earnings  is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices 
during the fourth quarter of  both the financial accounting standards board fasb and the staff of the sec re emphasized the importance of sound fair value measurement in financial reporting 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
this statement clarifies that determining fair value in an inactive or dislocated market depends on facts and circumstances and requires significant management judgment 
this statement specifies that it is acceptable to use inputs based on management estimates or assumptions  or for management to make adjustments to observable inputs to determine fair value when markets are not active and relevant observable inputs are not available 
our fair value measurement policies are consistent with the guidance in fsp no 
fas substantially all trading assets and trading liabilities are reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value  pursuant principally to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  specialized industry accounting for broker dealers and investment companies  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or the fair value option under either sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  or sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities ie  the fair value option 
upon becoming a bank holding company in september  we could no longer apply specialized broker dealer industry accounting to those subsidiaries not regulated as broker dealers 
therefore  within our non broker dealer subsidiaries  we designated as held for trading those instruments within the scope of sfas no 
ie  debt securities and marketable equity securities  and elected the fair value option for other cash instruments specifically loans  loan commitments and certain private equity and restricted public equity securities which we historically had carried at fair value 
these fair value elections were in addition to previous elections made for certain corporate loans  loan commitments and certificates of deposit issued by gs bank usa 
there was no impact on earnings from these initial elections because all of these instruments were already recorded at fair value in trading assets  at fair value or trading liabilities  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition prior to group inc becoming a bank holding company 

table of contents in determining fair value  we separate our trading assets  at fair value and trading liabilities  at fair value into two categories cash instruments and derivative contracts  as set forth in the following table trading instruments by category in millions as of november trading trading trading trading assets  at liabilities  at assets  at liabilities  at fair value fair value fair value fair value cash trading instruments icbc smfg other principal investments principal investments cash instruments exchange traded over the counter derivative contracts total includes interests of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs

our cash trading instruments are generally valued using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most us government and sovereign obligations  active listed equities and certain money market securities 
the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active  but are valued based on quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include most government agency securities  investment grade corporate bonds  certain mortgage products  certain bank loans and bridge loans  less liquid listed equities  state  municipal and provincial obligations and certain money market securities and loan commitments 
certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency 
such instruments include private equity and real estate fund investments  certain bank loans and bridge loans including certain mezzanine financing  leveraged loans arising from capital market transactions and other corporate bank debt  less liquid corporate debt securities and other debt obligations including less liquid high yield corporate bonds  distressed debt instruments and collateralized debt obligations cdos backed by corporate obligations  less liquid mortgage whole loans and securities backed by either commercial or residential real estate  and acquired portfolios of distressed loans 
the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value 
accordingly  when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument  the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price 
this valuation is adjusted only when changes to inputs and assumptions are corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt capital markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability 
such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
public principal investments 
our public principal investments held within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment tend to be large  concentrated holdings resulting from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions  and are valued based on quoted market prices 
for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability 
such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
our most significant public principal investment is our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc 
our investment in icbc is valued using the quoted market price adjusted for transfer restrictions 
the ordinary shares acquired from icbc are subject to transfer restrictions that  among other things  prohibit any sale  disposition or other transfer until april  from april  to october   we may transfer up to of the aggregate ordinary shares of icbc that we owned as of october  we may transfer the remaining shares after october  a portion of our interest is held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 

table of contents we also have an investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
this investment is valued using a model that is principally based on smfg s common stock price 
during our second quarter of  we converted one third of our smfg preferred stock investment into smfg common stock  and delivered the common stock to close out one third of our hedge position 
as of november  we remained hedged on the common stock underlying our remaining investment in smfg 
private principal investments 
our private principal investments held within the principal investments component of our trading and principal investments segment include investments in private equity  debt and real estate  primarily held through investment funds 
by their nature  these investments have little or no price transparency 
we value such instruments initially at transaction price and adjust valuations when evidence is available to support such adjustments 
such evidence includes transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt capital markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
derivative contracts 
derivative contracts can be exchange traded or over the counter otc 
we generally value exchange traded derivatives using models which calibrate to market clearing levels and eliminate timing differences between the closing price of the exchange traded derivatives and their underlying instruments 
otc derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible  including market based inputs to models  model calibration to market clearing transactions  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
where models are used  the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
valuation models require a variety of inputs  including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment 
certain otc derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information  and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult 
where we do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions  the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value 
accordingly  when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument  the model is adjusted so that the model value at inception equals the transaction price 
subsequent to initial recognition  we only update valuation inputs when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions  third party pricing services and or broker or dealer quotations  or other empirical market data 
in circumstances where we cannot verify the model value to market transactions  it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value 
see derivatives below for further information on our otc derivatives 
when appropriate  valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity  bid offer spreads and credit considerations 
such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
controls over valuation of financial instruments 
a control infrastructure  independent of the trading and investing functions  is fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market clearing levels exit price and that fair value measurements are reliable and consistently determined 

table of contents we employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties 
senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies to our audit committee 
we seek to maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control functions are performed appropriately 
we employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets  price verification  review of daily profit and loss  and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets 
these procedures are performed by personnel independent of the trading and investing functions 
for financial instruments where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable  we employ  where possible  procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions  analysis of actual to projected cash flows  comparisons with subsequent sales  reviews of valuations used for collateral management purposes and discussions with senior business leaders 
see market risk and credit risk below for a further discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our trading and principal investing businesses 
fair value hierarchy level sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
instruments that trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
we determine which instruments are classified within level based on the results of our price verification process 
this process is performed by personnel independent of our trading and investing functions who corroborate valuations to external market data eg  quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  third party pricing vendors  recent trading activity and comparative analyses to similar instruments 
when broker or dealer quotations or third party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification  greater priority is given to executable quotes 
as part of our price verification process  valuations based on quotes are corroborated by comparison both to other quotes and to recent trading activity in the same or similar instruments 
the number of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding sfas no 
recent market conditions  particularly in the fourth quarter of characterized by dislocations between asset classes  elevated levels of volatility  and reduced price transparency  have increased the level of management judgment required to value cash trading instruments classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in particular  management s judgment is required to determine the appropriate risk adjusted discount rate for cash trading instruments with little or no price transparency as a result of decreased volumes and lower levels of trading activity 
in such situations  our valuation is adjusted to approximate rates which market participants would likely consider appropriate for relevant credit and liquidity risks 
valuation methodologies for level assets 
instruments classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price  which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value 
as time passes  transaction price becomes less reliable as an estimate of fair value and accordingly  we use other methodologies to determine fair value  which vary based on the type of instrument  as described below 
regardless of the methodology  valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence 
senior management in control functions  independent of the trading and investing functions  reviews all significant unrealized gains losses  including the primary drivers of the change in value 
valuations are further corroborated by values realized upon 
table of contents sales of our level assets 
an overview of methodologies used to value our level assets subsequent to the transaction date is as follows private equity and real estate fund investments 
investments are generally held at cost for the first year 
recent third party investments or pending transactions are considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair value 
in the absence of such evidence  valuations are based on third party independent appraisals  transactions in similar instruments  discounted cash flow techniques  valuation multiples and public comparables 
such evidence includes pending reorganizations eg  merger proposals  tender offers or debt restructurings  and significant changes in financial metrics eg  operating results as compared to previous projections  industry multiples  credit ratings and balance sheet ratios 
bank loans and bridge loans and corporate debt securities and other debt obligations 
valuations are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques  for which the key inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  market yields for such instruments and recovery assumptions 
inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses  which incorporate comparisons both to credit default swaps that reference the same underlying credit risk and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotes are available 
loans and securities backed by commercial real estate 
loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are collateralized by specific assets and are generally tranched into varying levels of subordination 
due to the nature of these instruments  valuation techniques vary by instrument 
methodologies include relative value analyses across different tranches  comparisons to transactions in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or substantially the same underlying collateral  market indices such as the cmbx  and credit default swaps  as well as discounted cash flow techniques 
loans and securities backed by residential real estate 
valuations are based on both proprietary and industry recognized models including intex and bloomberg  discounted cash flow techniques and hypothetical securitization analyses 
in the recent market environment  the most significant inputs to the valuation of these instruments are rates of delinquency  default and loss expectations  which are driven in part by housing prices 
inputs are determined based on relative value analyses  which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles  including relevant indices such as the abx 
loan portfolios 
valuations are based on discounted cash flow techniques  for which the key inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and market yields for such instruments 
inputs are determined based on relative value analyses which incorporate comparisons to recent auction data for other similar loan portfolios 
derivative contracts 
valuation models are calibrated to initial transaction price 
subsequent changes in valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation models eg  interest rates  credit spreads  volatilities  etc inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data 
valuations of less liquid otc derivatives are typically based on level or level inputs that can be observed in the market  as well as unobservable inputs  such as correlations and volatilities 
total level assets were billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
the decrease in level assets for the year ended november primarily reflected i unrealized losses on loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  bank loans and bridge loans  and private equity and real estate fund investments  and ii sales and paydowns on bank loans and bridge loans and loan portfolios 
these decreases were partially offset by transfers to level of certain loans and securities backed by commercial real estate due to reduced price transparency 
the cmbx and abx are indices that track the performance of commercial mortgage bonds and subprime residential mortgage bonds  respectively

table of contents other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
in addition to trading assets  at fair value and trading liabilities  at fair value  we have elected to account for certain of our other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value under the fair value option 
the primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis  to mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes and to address simplification and cost benefit considerations 
such financial assets and financial liabilities accounted for at fair value include certain unsecured short term borrowings  consisting of all promissory notes and commercial paper and certain hybrid financial instruments  certain other secured financings  primarily transfers accounted for as financings rather than sales under sfas no 
 debt raised through our william street program and certain other nonrecourse financings  certain unsecured long term borrowings  including prepaid physical commodity transactions  resale and repurchase agreements  securities borrowed and loaned within trading and principal investments  consisting of our matched book and certain firm financing activities  certain corporate loans  loan commitments and certificates of deposit issued by gs bank usa as well as securities held by gs bank usa  receivables from customers and counterparties arising from transfers accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases under sfas no 
 certain insurance and reinsurance contracts  and in general  investments acquired after the adoption of sfas no 
where we have significant influence over the investee and would otherwise apply the equity method of accounting 
in certain cases  we may apply the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to our principal business activities  where we have a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee  or where cost benefit considerations are less significant 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally slk llc slk in  the ayco company  lp ayco in and our variable annuity and life insurance business in  we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
goodwill 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments  which are components one level below our three business segments  for impairment at least annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each segment observable average price to earnings multiples of our competitors in these businesses and price to book multiples 
we derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each operating segment 
our last annual impairment test was performed during our fourth quarter and no impairment was identified 
substantially all of our goodwill is in our equities component of our trading and principal investments segment and in our asset management and securities services segment 
our asset management and securities services segment generated record net revenues in and our equities component of our trading and principal investments segment had its second best year following its record net revenues in 
table of contents during  particularly during the fourth quarter  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
our stock price  consistent with stock prices in the broader financial services sector  declined significantly during this period of time 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization fell below recorded book value  principally during the last five weeks of the quarter 
with respect to the testing of our goodwill for impairment  we believe that it is reasonable to consider market capitalization as an indicator of fair value over a reasonable period of time 
if the current economic market conditions persist and if there is a prolonged period of weakness in the business environment and financial markets  our businesses may be adversely affected  which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future

we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated lives in accordance with sfas no 
or  in the case of insurance contracts  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  and sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
and sfas no 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value

voba represents the present value of estimated future gross profits of acquired variable annuity and life insurance businesses 
dac results from commissions paid by goldman sachs to the primary insurer ceding company on life and annuity reinsurance agreements as compensation to place the business with us and to cover the ceding company s acquisition expenses 
voba and dac are amortized over the estimated life of the underlying contracts based on estimated gross profits  and amortization is adjusted based on actual experience 
the seven year estimated life represents the weighted average remaining amortization period of the underlying contracts certain of which extend for approximately years 
primarily includes marketing related assets and power contracts 
a prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including i changes in market structure that could adversely affect our specialist businesses see discussion below  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or iii adverse actual experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and life insurance business 
in october  the sec approved the nyse s proposal to create a new market model and redefine the role of nyse dmms 
this new rule set further aligns the nyse s model with investor requirements for speed and efficiency of execution and establishes specialists as dmms 
while dmms still have an obligation to commit capital  they are now able to trade on parity with other market participants 
in addition  in november the nyse introduced a reserve order type that allows for anonymous trade execution  which is expected to allow the nyse to recapture liquidity and market share from other venues in which anonymous reserve orders have been available for some time 
the new rule set and the launch of the reserve order type  in combination with technology improvements to increase execution speed  are expected to bolster the nyse s competitive position 

table of contents in  we tested our nyse dmm rights for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of our nyse dmm rights exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows of the business over the estimated remaining life of our nyse dmm rights 
projected undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of our nyse dmm rights  and accordingly we did not record an impairment loss 
in projecting the undiscounted cash flows of the business  we made several important assumptions about the potential beneficial effects of the rule and market structure changes described above 
specifically  we assumed that total equity trading volumes in nyse listed companies will continue to grow at a rate consistent with recent historical trends  the nyse will be able to recapture approximately one half of the market share that it lost in  and we will increase our market share of the nyse dmm business and  as a dmm  the profitability of each share traded 
we also assumed that the rule changes would be implemented in our fiscal fourth quarter of as noted above  such rule changes were approved in october and that projected cash flow increases related to the implementation of the rule set would begin in  consistent with the assumptions above 
subsequently  there have been no events or changes in circumstances indicating that nyse dmm rights intangible asset may not be recoverable 
however  there can be no assurance that the assumptions  rule or structure changes described above will result in sufficient cash flows to avoid impairment of our nyse dmm rights in the future 
we will continue to evaluate the performance of the specialist business under the new market model 
as of november  the carrying value of our nyse dmm rights was million 
to the extent that there were to be an impairment in the future  it could result in a significant writedown in the carrying value of these dmm rights 
use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information on fin significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred

table of contents results of operations the composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed 
the composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in us and global economic and market conditions

tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts 
identifiable intangible assets associated with power contracts are not deducted from total shareholders equity because  unlike other intangible assets  less than of these assets are supported by common shareholders equity

table of contents net revenues versus our net revenues were billion in  a decrease of compared with  reflecting a particularly difficult operating environment  including significant asset price declines  high levels of volatility and reduced levels of liquidity  particularly in the fourth quarter 
in addition  credit markets experienced significant dislocation between prices for cash instruments and the related derivative contracts and between credit indices and underlying single names 
net revenues in trading and principal investments were significantly lower compared with  reflecting significant declines in ficc  principal investments and equities

net revenues in investment banking also declined significantly compared with  reflecting significantly lower net revenues in both financial advisory and underwriting 
in financial advisory  the decrease compared with particularly strong net revenues in reflected a decline in industry wide completed mergers and acquisitions 
the decrease in underwriting primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in debt underwriting  primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance and mortgage related activity  reflecting difficult market conditions 
net revenues in equity underwriting were slightly lower compared with  reflecting a decrease in industry wide equity and equity related offerings 
net revenues in asset management and securities services increased compared with securities services net revenues were higher  reflecting the impact of changes in the composition of securities lending customer balances  as well as higher total average customer balances 
asset management net revenues increased slightly compared with during the year  assets under management decreased billion to billion  due to billion of market depreciation  primarily in equity assets  partially offset by billion of net inflows

table of contents asset management and securities services our asset management and securities services segment is divided into two components asset management 
asset management provides investment advisory and financial planning services and offers investment products primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles  such as mutual funds and private investment funds across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and primarily generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees 
securities services 
securities services provides prime brokerage services  financing services and securities lending services to institutional clients  including hedge funds  mutual funds  pension funds and foundations  and to high net worth individuals worldwide  and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees 
assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage of asset value  which is affected by investment performance and by inflows and redemptions 
the fees that we charge vary by asset class  as do our related expenses 
in certain circumstances  we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund s return or when the return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other performance targets 
incentive fees are recognized when the performance period ends and they are no longer subject to adjustment 
we have numerous incentive fee arrangements  many of which have annual performance periods that end on december for that reason  incentive fees have been seasonally weighted to our first quarter

off balance sheet arrangements we have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  interests in limited and general partnerships  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  including total return swaps  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit and representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  including the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages  home equity and auto loans  government and corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets 
other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions  providing secondary market liquidity  making investments in performing and nonperforming debt  equity  real estate and other assets  providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
includes billion in net asset inflows in connection with our acquisition of macquarie imm investment management 

table of contents we engage in transactions with variable interest entities vies and qualifying special purpose entities qspes 
such vehicles are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets  since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting 
we did not have off balance sheet commitments to purchase or finance any cdos held by structured investment vehicles as of november or november in december  the american securitization forum asf issued the streamlined foreclosure and loss avoidance framework for securitized subprime adjustable rate mortgage loans asf framework 
the asf framework provides guidance for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation procedures and to facilitate the use of foreclosure and loss prevention measures for securitized subprime residential mortgages that meet certain criteria 
for certain eligible loans as defined in the asf framework  servicers may presume default is reasonably foreseeable and apply a fast track loan modification plan  under which the loan interest rate will be kept at the introductory rate for a period of five years following the upcoming reset date 
mortgage loan modifications of these eligible loans will not affect our accounting treatment for qspes that hold the subprime loans

table of contents equity capital the level and composition of our equity capital are principally determined by our consolidated regulatory capital requirements but may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to extreme and adverse changes in our business and market environments 
as of november  our total shareholders equity was billion consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion compared with total shareholders equity of billion as of november consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion 
in addition to total shareholders equity  we consider the billion of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts see discussion below to be part of our equity capital  as it qualifies as capital for regulatory and certain rating agency purposes 
consolidated capital requirements we are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the us federal banking agencies 
our bank depository institution subsidiaries  including gs bank usa  are subject to similar capital guidelines 
under the federal reserve board s capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action pca that is applicable to gs bank usa  goldman sachs and its bank depository institution subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices 
goldman sachs and its bank depository institution subsidiaries capital amounts  as well as gs bank usa s pca classification  are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
we anticipate reporting capital ratios as follows before we became a bank holding company  we were subject to capital guidelines by the sec as a consolidated supervised entity cse that were generally consistent with those set out in the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards issued by the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii 
we currently compute and report our firmwide capital ratios in accordance with the basel ii requirements as applicable to us when we were regulated as a cse for the purpose of assessing the adequacy of our capital 
under the basel ii framework as it applied to us when we were regulated as a cse  we evaluate our tier capital and total allowable capital as a percentage of rwas 
as of november  our total capital ratio total allowable capital as a percentage of rwas was and our tier ratio tier capital as a percentage of rwas was  in each case calculated under the basel ii framework as it applied to us when we were regulated as a cse 
see consolidated capital ratios below for further information 
we expect to continue to report to investors for a period of time our basel ii capital ratios as applicable to us when we were regulated as a cse 
the regulatory capital guidelines currently applicable to bank holding companies are based on the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision basel i  with basel ii to be phased in over time 
we are currently working with the federal reserve board to put in place the appropriate reporting and compliance mechanisms and methodologies to allow reporting of the basel i capital ratios as of the end of march in addition  we are currently working to implement the basel ii framework as applicable to us as a bank holding company as opposed to as a cse 
us banking regulators have incorporated the basel ii framework into the existing risk based capital requirements by requiring that internationally active banking organizations  such as group inc  transition to basel ii over the next several years 
the federal reserve board also has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines 
we were not subject to these guidelines before becoming a bank holding company and  accordingly  we are currently working with the federal reserve board to finalize our methodology for calculating this ratio 

table of contents the tier leverage ratio is defined as tier capital as applicable to us as a bank holding company divided by adjusted average total assets which includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that have received the highest supervisory rating under federal reserve board guidelines or that have implemented the federal reserve board s risk based capital measure for market risk 
other bank holding companies must have a minimum leverage ratio of 
bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels  depending upon their particular condition  risk profile and growth plans 
as of november  our estimated tier leverage ratio was 
this ratio represents a preliminary estimate and may be revised in subsequent filings as we continue to work with the federal reserve board to finalize the methodology for the calculation 
consolidated capital ratios the following table sets forth additional information on our capital ratios as of november calculated in the same manner generally consistent with basel ii as when the firm was regulated by the sec as a cse as of november in millions i 
tier and total allowable capital common shareholders equity preferred stock junior subordinated debt issued to trusts less goodwill less disallowable intangible assets less other deductions tier capital other components of total allowable capital qualifying subordinated debt less other deductions total allowable capital ii 
risk weighted assets market risk credit risk operational risk total risk weighted assets iii 
tier ratio iv 
total capital ratio principally included investments in regulated insurance entities and certain financial service entities was deducted from both tier capital and total allowable capital 
substantially all of our existing subordinated debt qualified as total allowable capital for cse purposes 
our rwas are driven by the amount of market risk  credit risk and operational risk associated with our business activities in a manner generally consistent with methodologies set out in basel ii 
the methodologies used to compute rwas for each of market risk  credit risk and operational risk are closely aligned with our risk management practices 
see market risk and credit risk below for a discussion of how we manage risks in our trading and principal investing businesses 
further details on the methodologies used to calculate rwas are set forth below 

table of contents risk weighted assets for market risk for positions captured in var  rwas are calculated using var and other model based measures  including requirements for incremental default risk and other event risks 
var is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
market risk rwas are calculated consistent with the specific conditions set out in the basel ii framework based on var calibrated to a confidence level  over a day holding period  multiplied by a factor 
additional rwas are calculated with respect to incremental default risk and other event risks  in a manner generally consistent with our internal risk management methodologies 
for positions not included in var because var is not the most appropriate measure of risk  we calculate rwas based on alternative methodologies  including sensitivity analyses 
risk weighted assets for credit risk rwas for credit risk are calculated for on and off balance sheet exposures that are not captured in our market risk rwas  with the exception of otc derivatives for which both market risk and credit risk rwas are calculated 
the calculations are consistent with the advanced internal ratings based airb approach and the internal models method imm of basel ii  and were based on exposure at default ead  which is an estimate of the amount that would be owed to us at the time of a default  multiplied by each counterparty s risk weight 
under the basel ii airb approach  a counterparty s risk weight is generally derived from a combination of the probability of default pd  the loss given default lgd and the maturity of the trade or portfolio of trades  where pd is an estimate of the probability that an obligor will default over a one year horizon 
pd is derived from the use of internally determined equivalents of public rating agency ratings 
lgd is an estimate of the economic loss rate if a default occurs during economic downturn conditions 
lgd is determined based on industry data 
for otc derivatives and funding trades such as repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions  we use the basel ii imm approach  which allows ead to be calculated using model based measures to determine potential exposure  consistent with models and methodologies that we use for internal risk management purposes 
for commitments  ead is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding notional balance 
for other credit exposures  ead is generally the carrying value of the exposure 
risk weighted assets for operational risk rwas for operational risk are calculated using a risk based methodology consistent with the qualitative and quantitative criteria for the advanced measurement approach ama  as defined in basel ii 
the methodology incorporates internal loss events  relevant external loss events  results of scenario analyses and management s assessment of our business environment and internal controls 
we estimate capital requirements for both expected and unexpected losses  seeking to capture the major drivers of operational risk over a one year time horizon  at a confidence level 
operational risk capital is allocated among our businesses and is regularly reported to senior management and key risk and oversight committees 
rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of group inc  which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of the firm s senior unsecured obligations 
the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings 
each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital 
table of contents adequacy  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation 
see liquidity and funding risk credit ratings below for further information regarding our credit ratings 
subsidiary capital requirements many of our subsidiaries are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements in the us and or elsewhere

gs bank usa was formed in november through the merger of our existing utah industrial bank named gs bank usa into our new york limited purpose trust company  with the surviving company taking the name gs bank usa 
as of november  gs bank usa s predecessor was a wholly owned industrial bank regulated by the utah department of financial institutions  was a member of the fdic and was subject to minimum capital requirements 
we compute the capital ratios for gs bank usa in accordance with the basel i framework for purposes of assessing the adequacy of its capital 
in order to be considered a well capitalized depository institution under the federal reserve board guidelines  gs bank usa must maintain a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
in connection with the november asset transfer described below  gs bank usa agreed with the federal reserve board to minimum capital ratios in excess of these well capitalized levels 
accordingly  for a period of time  gs bank usa is expected to maintain a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
in november  we contributed subsidiaries with an aggregate of billion of assets into gs bank usa which brought total assets in gs bank usa to billion as of november 
as a result  we are currently working with the federal reserve board to finalize our methodology for the basel i calculations

the junior subordinated debt is included in unsecured long term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
in connection with the apex issuance  we entered into stock purchase contracts with goldman sachs capital ii and iii under which we will be obligated to sell and these entities will be obligated to purchase billion of perpetual non cumulative preferred stock that we will issue in the future 
goldman sachs capital ii and iii are required to remarket the junior subordinated debt in order to fund their purchase of the preferred stock  but in the event that a remarketing is unsuccessful  they will relinquish the subordinated debt to us in exchange for the preferred stock 
because of certain characteristics of the junior subordinated debt and the associated apex  including its long term nature  the future issuance of perpetual non cumulative preferred stock under the stock purchase contracts  our ability to defer payments due on the debt and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure  it qualifies as tier and total allowable capital and is included as part of our equity capital

we issued billion of junior subordinated debentures in to goldman sachs capital i  a delaware statutory trust that  in turn  issued billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests to third parties and million of common beneficial interests to goldman sachs 
the junior subordinated debentures are included in unsecured long term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
because of certain characteristics of the junior subordinated debt and the associated trust preferred securities  including its long term nature  our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten consecutive semi annual periods and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure  it qualifies as tier and total allowable capital and is included as part of our equity capital

we consider junior subordinated debt issued to trusts to be a component of our tangible equity capital base due to certain characteristics of the debt  including its long term nature  our ability to defer payments due on the debt and the subordinated nature of the debt in our capital structure 
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity capital as of november in millions total shareholders equity add junior subordinated debt issued to trusts   deduct goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  excluding power contracts   tangible equity capital 
table of contents the leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity 
this ratio is different from the tier leverage ratios included in equity capital consolidated capital requirements and equity capital subsidiary capital requirements above 
the adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital 
we believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed in our businesses 
the debt to equity ratio equals unsecured long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity

table of contents risk management management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of goldman sachs 
accordingly  we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor  evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these risks include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal and reputational exposures 
risk management structure we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial  credit  operational  compliance and legal reporting systems 
in addition  a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process  as described further below 
these committees including their subcommittees  meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units 
segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process 
in addition to the committees described below  functions that are independent of the revenue producing units  such as compliance  finance  legal  management controls internal audit and operations  perform risk management functions  which include monitoring  analyzing and evaluating risk 
management committee 
all risk control functions ultimately report to our management committee 
through both direct and delegated authority  the management committee approves all of our operating activities and trading risk parameters 
risk committees 
the firmwide risk committee reviews the activities of existing trading businesses  approves new businesses and products  approves firmwide market risk limits  reviews business unit market risk limits  approves market risk limits for selected sovereign markets and business units  approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings group  and reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements 
the securities divisional risk committee sets market risk limits for our trading activities subject to overall firmwide risk limits  based on a number of measures  including var  stress tests and scenario analyses 
business unit risk limits are established by the appropriate risk committee and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks 
trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their respective markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
market risk limits are monitored by the finance division and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee 
limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and business unit managers and addressed  as necessary 
credit risk limits are also monitored by the finance division and reviewed by the appropriate risk committee 
the asset management divisional risk committee oversees various risk  valuation and credit issues related to our asset management business 
business practices committee 
the business practices committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance and operational risks and related reputational concerns  seeks to ensure the consistency of our policies  practices and procedures with our business principles  and makes recommendations on ways to mitigate potential risks 

table of contents firmwide capital committee 
the firmwide capital committee reviews and approves transactions involving commitments of our capital 
such capital commitments include  but are not limited to  extensions of credit  alternative liquidity commitments  certain bond underwritings and certain distressed debt and principal finance activities 
the firmwide capital committee is also responsible for establishing business and reputational standards for capital commitments and seeking to ensure that they are maintained on a global basis 
commitments committee 
the commitments committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities  primarily with respect to offerings of equity and equity related securities  and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal  reputational  regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities 
in addition to reviewing specific transactions  the commitments committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices 
credit policy committee 
the credit policy committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by the credit department 
finance committee 
the finance committee establishes and oversees our liquidity policies  sets certain inventory position limits and has oversight responsibility for liquidity risk  the size and composition of our balance sheet and capital base  and our credit ratings 
the finance committee regularly reviews our funding position and capitalization and makes adjustments in light of current events  risks and exposures 
new products committee 
the new products committee  under the oversight of the firmwide risk committee  is responsible for reviewing and approving new products and businesses globally 
operational risk committee 
the operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies  framework and methodologies  and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management 
structured products committee 
the structured products committee reviews and approves structured product transactions entered into with our clients that raise legal  regulatory  tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to goldman sachs 
market risk the potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk 
such positions result from market making  proprietary trading  underwriting  specialist and investing activities 
substantially all of our inventory positions are marked to market on a daily basis and changes are recorded in net revenues 
categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
a description of each market risk category is set forth below interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 

table of contents we seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
for example  we may seek to hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract 
the ability to manage an exposure may  however  be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument 
in addition to applying business judgment  senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk for trading assets  at fair value and trading liabilities  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
these tools include risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as var  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and inventory position limits for selected business units 
var var is the potential loss in value of trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
for the var numbers reported below  a one day time horizon and a confidence level were used 
this means that there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
thus  shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported var would be anticipated to occur  on average  about once a month 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also occur more frequently or accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while we believe that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
we use historical data to estimate our var and  to better reflect current asset volatilities  we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
different var methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different var 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day

see other market risk measures below 
equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in  principally due to increases in the interest rate  commodity price and currency rate categories  partially offset by a decrease in the equity price category 
the increase in interest rates was primarily due to higher levels of volatility and wider spreads  partially offset by position reductions  and the increases in commodity prices and currency rates were primarily due to higher levels of volatility 
the decrease in equity prices was principally due to position reductions  partially offset by higher levels of volatility 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure and volatility in interest rates and equity prices 
var excludes the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected

trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our one day var on and occasions during and  respectively 
other market risk measures certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var  where var is not the most appropriate measure of risk eg  due to transfer restrictions and or illiquidity 
the market risk related to our investment in the ordinary shares of icbc  excluding interests held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs  is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in the icbc ordinary share price 
the market risk related to the remaining positions is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a decline in asset values 
the sensitivity analyses for equity and debt positions in our trading portfolio and equity  debt primarily mezzanine instruments and real estate positions in our non trading portfolio are measured by the impact of a decline in the asset values including the impact of leverage in the underlying investments for real estate positions in our non trading portfolio of such positions 
the fair value of the underlying positions may be impacted by factors such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt capital markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 

table of contents the following table sets forth market risk for positions not included in var

direct investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation

primarily relates to interests in our merchant banking funds that invest in corporate equities 
primarily relates to interests in our merchant banking funds that invest in corporate mezzanine debt instruments 
primarily relates to interests in our merchant banking funds that invest in real estate 
such funds typically employ leverage as part of the investment strategy 
this sensitivity measure is based on our percentage ownership of the underlying asset values in the funds and unfunded commitments to the funds 
the decrease in our sensitivity measures as of november from november for equity and debt positions in our trading portfolio was due to dispositions and a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio  partially offset by new investments 
the increase in our sensitivity measures as of november from november for our non trading portfolio excluding icbc was due to new investments  partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio 
in addition to the positions included in var and the other risk measures described above  as of november  we held approximately billion of financial instruments in our bank and insurance subsidiaries  primarily consisting of billion of us government  federal agency and sovereign obligations  billion of corporate debt securities and other debt obligations  billion of money market instruments  and billion of mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities 
as of november  we held approximately billion of financial instruments in our bank and insurance subsidiaries  primarily consisting of billion of mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities  billion of corporate debt securities and other debt obligations and billion of us government  federal agency and sovereign obligations 
in addition  as of november and november  we held commitments and loans under the william street credit extension program 
see contractual obligations and commitments commitments above for information on our william street program 

table of contents credit risk credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us  or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or other instruments  including otc derivatives  we hold 
our exposure to credit risk principally arises through our trading  investing and financing activities 
to reduce our credit exposures  we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
in addition  we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by i entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis  ii seeking third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations  and or iii transferring our credit risk to third parties using credit derivatives and or other structures and techniques 
to measure and manage our credit exposures  we use a variety of tools  including credit limits referenced to both current exposure and potential exposure 
potential exposure is an estimate of exposure  within a specified confidence level  that could be outstanding over the life of a transaction based on market movements 
in addition  as part of our market risk management process  for positions measured by changes in credit spreads  we use var and other sensitivity measures 
to supplement our primary credit exposure measures  we also use scenario analyses  such as credit spread widening scenarios  stress tests and other quantitative tools 
our global credit management systems monitor credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their affiliates 
these systems also provide management  including the firmwide risk and credit policy committees  with information regarding credit risk by product  industry sector  country and region 
while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties  we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks and investment funds  resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry 
in the ordinary course of business  we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty  borrower or issuer 
as of november and november  we held billion of total assets and billion of total assets  respectively  of us government and federal agency obligations included in trading assets  at fair value and cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
as of november and november  we held billion of total assets and billion of total assets  respectively  of other sovereign obligations  principally consisting of securities issued by the governments of japan and the united kingdom 
in addition  as of november and november  billion and billion of our securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed including those in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes  respectively  were collateralized by us government and federal agency obligations 
as of november and november  billion and billion of our securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed  respectively  were collateralized by other sovereign obligations 
as of november and november  we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded of our total assets 
however  over the past several years  the amount and duration of our credit exposures with respect to otc derivatives has been increasing  due to  among other factors  the growth of our otc derivative activities and market evolution toward longer dated transactions 
a further discussion of our derivative activities follows below 

table of contents derivatives derivative contracts are instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps or option contracts  that derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into to facilitate client transactions  to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management 
in addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes  we enter into derivative contracts to manage currency exposure on our net investment in non us operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings 
derivatives are used in many of our businesses  and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged  or as part of a broader trading strategy 
accordingly  the market risk of derivative positions is managed together with our nonderivative positions 
the fair value of our derivative contracts is reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and is reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when we believe a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
for an otc derivative  our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract 

table of contents the following tables set forth the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining contractual maturity otc derivatives in millions assets as of november years contract type months years years or greater total interest rates credit derivatives currencies commodities equities netting across contract types subtotal cross maturity netting cash collateral netting total liabilities years contract type months years years or greater total interest rates credit derivatives currencies commodities equities netting across contract types subtotal cross maturity netting cash collateral netting total represents the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across contract types within a maturity category  pursuant to credit support agreements

derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty  that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty 
we attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction 
in addition  certain derivative transactions eg  credit derivative contracts involve the risk that we may have difficulty obtaining  or be unable to obtain  the underlying security or obligation in order to satisfy any physical settlement requirement 

table of contents liquidity and funding risk liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector 
most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances 
accordingly  goldman sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both goldman sachs specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund goldman sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenues  even under adverse circumstances 
we have implemented a number of policies according to the following liquidity risk management framework excess liquidity we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment  including financing obligations 
asset liability management we seek to maintain secured and unsecured funding sources that are sufficiently long term in order to withstand a prolonged or severe liquidity stressed environment without having to rely on asset sales 
conservative liability structure we seek to access funding across a diverse range of markets  products and counterparties  emphasize less credit sensitive sources of funding and conservatively manage the distribution of funding across our entity structure 
crisis planning we base our liquidity and funding management on stress scenario planning and maintain a crisis plan detailing our response to a liquidity threatening event 
excess liquidity our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity 
this global core excess is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
we believe that this pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
our global core excess reflects the following principles the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
goldman sachs businesses are diverse  and its cash needs are driven by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable  and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our unsecured liabilities and our funding costs 

table of contents the size of our global core excess is based on an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of goldman sachs 
our liquidity model identifies and estimates cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis  including  but not limited to upcoming maturities of unsecured debt and letters of credit  potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable unsecured debt and potential withdrawals of client deposits  adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding  derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows  including those due to market moves  potential cash outflows associated with our prime brokerage business  additional collateral that could be called in the event of a two notch downgrade in our credit ratings  draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by william street funding corporation  and upcoming cash outflows  such as tax and other large payments 
the following table sets forth the average loan value the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities  as well as overnight cash deposits  of our global core excess year ended november in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total global core excess the us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered us government securities  us agency securities and highly liquid us agency mortgage backed securities  all of which are eligible as collateral in federal reserve open market operations  as well as overnight cash deposits 
our non us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered french  german  united kingdom and japanese government bonds and overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies 
we strictly limit our global core excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash because we believe they are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
we do not believe other potential sources of excess liquidity  such as lower quality unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities  are as reliable in a liquidity crisis 
we maintain our global core excess to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and all of its subsidiaries 
the amount of our global core excess is driven by our assessment of potential cash and collateral outflows  regulatory obligations and the currency and timing requirements of our global business model 
in addition  we recognize that our global core excess held in a regulated entity may not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore may only be available to meet the potential liquidity requirements of that entity 
the global core excess excludes liquid assets of billion held separately by william street funding corporation 
see contractual obligations and commitments above for a further discussion of the william street credit extension program 
beginning in  our global core excess as presented includes the global core excess of gs bank usa and gs bank europe 
the amounts include billion of global core excess at gs bank usa 

table of contents in addition to our global core excess  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities 
these assets  which are located in the u 
s  europe and asia  include other government bonds  high grade money market securities  corporate bonds and marginable equities 
we do not include these securities in our global core excess 
we maintain our global core excess and other unencumbered assets in an amount that  if pledged or sold  would provide the funds necessary to replace at least of our unsecured obligations that are scheduled to mature or where holders have the option to redeem within the next months 
we assume conservative loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions asset class by asset class 
the estimated aggregate loan value of our global core excess  as well as overnight cash deposits  and our other unencumbered assets averaged billion and billion for the fiscal years ended november and november  respectively 
asset liability management we seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily 
we utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold inventory over longer periods of time 
we believe that these limits provide a complementary mechanism for ensuring appropriate balance sheet liquidity in addition to our standard position limits 
although our balance sheet fluctuates due to client activity  market conventions and periodic market opportunities in certain of our businesses  our total assets and adjusted assets at financial statement dates are typically not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods 
we seek to manage the maturity profile of our secured and unsecured funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due  even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress 
we do not rely on immediate sales of assets other than our global core excess to maintain liquidity in a distressed environment  although we recognize orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis 
in order to avoid reliance on asset sales  our goal is to ensure that we have sufficient total capital unsecured long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity to fund our balance sheet for at least one year 
the target amount of our total capital is based on an internal liquidity model  which incorporates  among other things  the following long term financing requirements the portion of trading assets that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress  assuming conservative loan values  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  property  leasehold improvements and equipment  and other illiquid assets  derivative and other margin and collateral requirements  anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments  and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that are in excess of their long term financing requirements 
see conservative liability structure below for a further discussion of how we fund our subsidiaries 

table of contents certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress 
accordingly  we generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments 
the following table sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments as of november in millions mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities bank loans and bridge loans emerging market debt securities high yield and other debt obligations private equity and real estate fund investments emerging market equity securities icbc ordinary shares smfg convertible preferred stock other restricted public equity securities other investments in funds includes funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our origination and secondary trading activities 
includes interests in our merchant banking funds 
such amounts exclude assets related to consolidated investment funds of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  for which goldman sachs does not bear economic exposure 
includes interests of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  held by investment funds managed by goldman sachs 
during our second quarter of  we converted one third of our smfg preferred stock investment into smfg common stock  and delivered the common stock to close out one third of our hedge position 
includes interests in other investment funds that we manage 
excludes billion as of november of mortgage whole loans that were transferred to securitization vehicles where such transfers were accounted for as secured financings rather than sales under sfas no 
we distributed to investors the securities that were issued by the securitization vehicles and therefore did not bear economic exposure to the underlying mortgage whole loans 
a large portion of these assets are funded through secured funding markets or nonrecourse financing 
we focus on funding these assets on a secured basis with long contractual maturities to reduce refinancing risk in periods of market stress 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding the financial instruments we hold 
conservative liability structure we seek to structure our liabilities conservatively to reduce refinancing risk and the risk that we may be required to redeem or repurchase certain of our borrowings prior to their contractual maturity 
we fund a substantial portion of our inventory on a secured basis  which we believe provides goldman sachs with a more stable source of liquidity than unsecured financing  as it is less sensitive to changes in our credit due to the underlying collateral 
however  we recognize that the terms or availability of secured funding  particularly overnight funding  can deteriorate rapidly in a difficult environment 
to help mitigate this risk  we raise the majority of our funding for durations longer than overnight 
we seek longer terms for secured funding collateralized by lower quality assets  as we believe these funding transactions may pose greater refinancing risk 
the weighted average life of our secured funding  excluding funding collateralized by highly liquid securities  such as us  french  german  united kingdom and japanese government bonds  and us agency securities  exceeded days as of november 
table of contents our liquidity also depends to an important degree on the stability of our short term unsecured financing base 
accordingly  we prefer the use of promissory notes in which goldman sachs does not make a market over commercial paper  which we may repurchase prior to maturity through the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
as of november and november  our unsecured short term borrowings  including the current portion of unsecured long term borrowings  were billion and billion  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of our annual report on form k for further information regarding our unsecured short term borrowings 
we issue long term borrowings as a source of total capital in order to meet our long term financing requirements 
the following table sets forth our quarterly unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile through unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile in millions the weighted average maturity of our unsecured long term borrowings as of november was approximately eight years 
to mitigate refinancing risk  we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year 
we swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into us dollar obligations with short term floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements 
we issue substantially all of our unsecured debt without provisions that would  based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings  financial ratios  earnings  cash flows or stock price  trigger a requirement for an early payment  collateral support  change in terms  acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation 
as of november  our bank depository institution subsidiaries had billion in customer deposits  including billion of deposits from our bank sweep programs and billion of brokered certificates of deposit with a weighted average maturity of three years 
in addition  we are pursuing a number of strategies to raise additional deposits as a source of funding for the firm 
as of 
table of contents september  gs bank usa has access to funding through the federal reserve bank discount window 
while we do not rely on funding through the federal reserve bank discount window in our liquidity modeling and stress testing  we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access this funding 
we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding 
we make extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets  as well as other secured funding markets 
in addition  we issue debt through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term note programs  offshore medium term note offerings and other bond offerings  us and us commercial paper and promissory note issuances and other methods 
we also arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf 
we seek to distribute our funding products through our own sales force to a large  diverse global creditor base and we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
our creditors include banks  governments  securities lenders  pension funds  insurance companies  mutual funds and individuals 
we access funding in a variety of markets in the americas  europe and asia 
we have imposed various internal guidelines on creditor concentration  including the amount of our commercial paper and promissory notes that can be owned and letters of credit that can be issued by any single creditor or group of creditors 
in the latter half of  we were unable to raise significant amounts of long term unsecured debt in the public markets  other than as a result of the issuance of securities guaranteed by the fdic under the tlgp 
it is unclear when we will regain access to the public long term unsecured debt markets on customary terms or whether any similar program will be available after the tlgp s scheduled june expiration 
however  we continue to have access to short term funding and to a number of sources of secured funding  both in the private markets and through various government and central bank sponsored initiatives 
over the past year  a number of us regulatory agencies have taken steps to enhance the liquidity support available to financial services companies such as group inc  gs co  gsi and gs bank usa 
some of these steps include the federal reserve bank of new york established the primary dealer credit facility in march to provide overnight funding to primary dealers in exchange for a specified range of collateral 
in september  the eligible collateral was expanded to include all collateral eligible in tri party repurchase arrangements with the major clearing banks  and the facility was made available to gsi 
this facility is scheduled to expire on april  the federal reserve board introduced a new term securities lending facility tslf in march  which extended the term for which the federal reserve board will lend treasury securities to primary dealers from overnight to days and  in september  expanded the types of assets that can be used as collateral under the tslf to include all investment grade debt securities rather than just treasury  agency and certain aaa rated asset backed securities 
this facility is scheduled to expire on april  in october  the federal reserve board established the commercial paper funding facility cpff to serve as a funding backstop to facilitate the issuance of term commercial paper by eligible issuers 
through the cpff  the federal reserve bank of new york will finance the purchase of unsecured and asset backed highly rated  us dollar denominated  three month commercial paper from eligible issuers through its primary dealers 
the facility is scheduled to expire on april  our available funding under the cpff is approximately billion  of which a de minimis amount was utilized as of january  
table of contents the fdic s tlgp  which was established in october  provides a guarantee of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by eligible entities  including group inc and gs bank usa  as well as funds over  in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts held by fdic insured banks such as gs bank usa 
the debt guarantee is available  subject to limitations  for debt issued through june  and the deposit coverage lasts through december  we are able to have outstanding approximately billion of debt under the tlgp that is issued prior to june  as of november and january   we had outstanding billion of senior unsecured short term borrowings and billion of senior unsecured debt comprised of billion of short term and billion of long term  respectively  under the tlgp 
see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses above  and risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k for a discussion of factors that could impair our ability to access the capital markets 
subsidiary funding policies 
substantially all of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company  group inc the parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing and capital requirements 
in addition  the parent company provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through secured funding and deposits 
our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an assumption that  unless legally provided for  funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
as such  we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other subsidiaries until the maturity of such financing 
in addition  we recognize that the global core excess held in our regulated entities may not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore may only be available to meet the potential liquidity requirements of those entities 
we also manage our liquidity risk by requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company 
this policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent company s third party borrowings 
in addition  many of our subsidiaries and affiliates maintain unencumbered assets to cover their unsecured intercompany borrowings other than subordinated debt in order to mitigate parent company liquidity risk 
group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries  for example  as of november  group inc had billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in gs co  its principal us registered broker dealer  billion invested in gsi  a regulated uk broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  a lp registered broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs japan co  ltd  a regulated japanese broker dealer  and billion invested in gs bank usa  a regulated new york state chartered bank 
group inc also had billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as of november  as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 

table of contents crisis planning in order to be prepared for a liquidity event  or a period of market stress  we base our liquidity risk management framework and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative stress scenario assumptions 
our planning incorporates several market based and operational stress scenarios 
we also periodically conduct liquidity crisis drills to test our lines of communication and backup funding procedures 
in addition  we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to a liquidity threatening event 
the plan provides the framework to estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on goldman sachs based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be implemented based on the severity of the event 
credit ratings we rely upon the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings 
credit ratings are important when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions  including otc derivatives 
we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity  market  credit and operational risk management practices  the level and variability of our earnings  our capital base  our franchise  reputation and management  our corporate governance and the external operating environment 
see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses above  and risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings

table of contents based on our credit ratings as of november  additional collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of approximately billion and billion would have been required in the event of a one notch and two notch reduction  respectively  in our long term credit ratings 
based on our credit ratings reflected in the above table  additional collateral or termination payments pursuant to bilateral agreements with certain counterparties of approximately million and billion would have been required in the event of a one notch and two notch reduction  respectively  in our long term credit ratings as of december  in evaluating our liquidity requirements  we consider additional collateral or termination payments that would be required in the event of a two notch reduction in our long term credit ratings  as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties  but is available to them 
cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and  consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above 
cash flow analysis may  however  be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our business 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from operating and financing activities  primarily from common and preferred stock issuances and deposits  partially offset by repayments of short term borrowings 
we used net cash of billion in our investing activities 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing and investing activities  primarily through the issuance of unsecured borrowings  partially offset by common stock repurchases 
we used net cash of billion in our operating activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves 
operational risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes  people or systems  or from external events 
operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents related to  for example  major systems failures 
operational risk may also cause reputational harm 
thus  efforts to identify  manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss 
we manage operational risk through the application of long standing  but continuously evolving  firmwide control standards which are supported by the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks across goldman sachs  and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor operational risk on a daily basis 
together  these elements form a strong firmwide control culture that serves as the foundation of our efforts to minimize operational risk exposure 
operational risk management analysis  a risk management function independent of our revenue producing units  is responsible for developing and implementing a formalized framework to identify  measure  monitor  and report operational risks to support active risk management across goldman sachs 
this framework  which evolves with the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance  incorporates analysis of internal and external operational risk events  business environment and internal control factors  and scenario analysis 
the framework also provides regular reporting of our operational risk exposures to our board  risk committees and senior management 
for a further discussion of operational risk see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses above  and risk factors in part i  item a of our annual report on form k
