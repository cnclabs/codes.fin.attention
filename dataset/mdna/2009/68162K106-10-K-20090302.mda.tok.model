item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading us steel service center with over years of experience 
our primary focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
we operate as an intermediary between steel producers and manufacturers that require processed steel for their operations 
we serve customers in most carbon steel consuming industries  including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment  construction and farm machinery  storage tanks  environmental and energy generation  automobiles  food service and electrical equipment  military vehicles and equipment  as well as general and plate fabricators and steel service centers 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
we operate as a single business segment with strategically located processing and distribution facilities in connecticut  georgia  illinois  iowa  michigan  minnesota  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania and south carolina 
this geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi national accounts  primarily located throughout the midwestern  eastern and southern united states 
we sell a broad range of steel products  many of which have different gross profits and margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit and higher margins 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by  among other things  product mix  the amount of processing performed  the availability of steel  volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by our michigan and georgia operations 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in puerto rico and mexico 
all international sales and payments are made in us dollars 
recent international sales have been immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including  but not limited to  general and global business  economic  financial  or banking and political conditions  competition  steel pricing and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of steel  inventory held in the supply chain  customer demand for steel and customers ability to manage their credit line availability and layoffs or work stoppages by our own  our suppliers or our customers personnel 
the steel industry also continues to be affected by the global consolidation of our suppliers  competitors and end use customers 
like many other steel service centers  we maintain substantial inventories of steel to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase steel in a effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices  contracts with customers and market conditions 
our commitments to purchase steel are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
we have no long term  fixed price steel purchase contracts 
when steel prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  the net sales and profitability of our business could be adversely affected 
when steel prices decline  as they did in the fourth quarter of and continue in  customer demands for lower prices and our competitors responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and  consequently  lower margins as we use existing steel inventory 
at december   we employed approximately  people  of which approximately of the hourly plant personnel at our minneapolis and detroit facilities are represented by four separate collective bargaining units 
a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately five detroit maintenance workers was extended to 
table of contents july  collective bargaining agreements covering minneapolis and other detroit employees expire in and subsequent years  including a contract covering minneapolis plate facility employees which expires at the end of march we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good 
however  any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon the application of an historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
we cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased steel  internal and external processing  and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when steel is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is transferred  which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  substantially all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for the years ended december   and dollars shown in thousands of net of net of net sales sales sales net sales gross profit a operating expenses b operating income a gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold 
b operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold 
compared to tons sold in decreased to million tons from million tons last year 
tons sold in included million tons from direct sales and thousand tons from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in recessionary pressures and unprecedented crises in global financial markets during the second half of led to a decrease in tons sold 
we expect these conditions to continue or worsen in  resulting in lower tons sold 
net sales in increased to billion from billion 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to higher average selling prices 
average selling prices for increased from average selling prices began to decrease during the fourth quarter of due to reduced customer demand and the sharp reduction in the price of steel offered by steel producers 
we expect average selling prices to decrease in from levels experienced during the fourth quarter of due to recessionary pressures and reduced customer demand 
in  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased to from in higher selling prices were primarily the result of higher steel prices from steel producers that were passed through to our customers 
during the first three quarters of  carbon steel prices approximately doubled  resulting in higher cost of materials sold 
for most of  the increase in average selling prices exceeded the increase in average cost of materials sold  resulting in higher gross profit  as we sold inventory which was acquired earlier in the year at lower prices 
the price of steel purchased from steel producers began to decrease in the late third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  our average selling prices decreased while our average cost of materials sold increased  as we sold inventory which was acquired during the third quarter of at higher prices 
as a result  our average gross profit began to fall during the fourth quarter of and we expect that situation to continue or worsen in as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses for decreased to from in operating expenses for increased to million from million in higher operating expenses in were primarily attributable to increased levels of variable incentive compensation associated with higher levels of profitability the majority of which was recorded in the general and administrative operating expense caption  with a portion also recorded in the warehouse and processing caption  increased sales commissions and bad debt expense recorded in the selling expense caption  increased distribution expense resulting from higher fuel costs recorded in the distribution expense caption and increased warehouse and processing expense associated 
table of contents with higher levels of value added services provided to our customers 
most of the higher operating expenses recorded in are variable and are tied to higher levels of profitability 
as profitability declined in the fourth quarter of  and is expected to decline in  many of these expenses have decreased accordingly 
additionally  starting in the second half of  we have eliminated our temporary labor  restricted overtime and introduced reduced work weeks  resulting in the reduction of approximately full time equivalent employees or of our workforce 
interest and other expense on debt decreased to million from million in the decrease in interest expense in was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and borrowing rates  and the capitalization of interest into certain long term capital projects 
our effective borrowing rate  exclusive of deferred financing fees  was in  compared to in in  we reported income before income taxes of million  compared to million in an income tax provision of was recorded during  compared to in taxes paid in totaled million  compared to million in net income for totaled million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in compared to tons sold in decreased to million tons from million tons in tons sold in included million tons from direct sales and thousand tons from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in net sales in increased to billion from million 
average selling prices for increased from in  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to from in higher inventory levels at steel service centers at the beginning of led to competitive pressures and gross margins throughout most of the year 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses for increased to from in operating expenses for increased to million from million in the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of our north carolina facility s operating expenses in acquired in june and a full year of costs associated with the development of our new information system which began during the third quarter of and is primarily recorded in the general and administrative expense caption 
financing costs for increased to million from million in our effective borrowing rate  inclusive of deferred financing fees  was in  compared to in in  we reported income before income taxes of million  compared to million in an income tax provision of was recorded during  compared to in taxes paid in totaled million  compared to million in net income for totaled million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing and upgrading of processing equipment and facilities  making acquisitions and paying dividends 
we use cash generated from operations  leasing transactions and borrowings under our credit facility to fund these requirements 
we believe that funds available under our credit facility and lease arrangements  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements over at least the next months 
in the future  we may as part of our business strategy  acquire and dispose of other assets in the same or complementary lines of business  or enter 
table of contents into or exit strategic alliances and joint ventures 
accordingly  the timing and size of our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
compared to working capital at december  increased million from the end of the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in inventories and an million decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the fluctuation in inventories is primarily attributable to higher levels of inventory held at year end due to weaker than expected fourth quarter sales at higher  overall prices 
during  we generated million of net cash from operations  of which million was derived from cash earnings and million was used for working capital 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
in  depending on global banking and economic conditions  we anticipate capital expenditures of to million  primarily to complete projects which we began in which will further our value added strategies in both existing and new facilities  equipment and technology 
in october  we began construction of a new facility in sumter  south carolina 
the facility is expected to be completed in and involves the construction and equipping of a  square foot building at a total investment of approximately million 
in september  we began the process of expanding our chambersburg  pennsylvania facility by  square feet at a total cost of approximately million 
the expansion is expected to be operational during the second quarter of a new stretcher leveler cut to length line for our minneapolis coil facility became operational during the third quarter of in july  we purchased land and a building to house a new satellite facility in dover  ohio at a total investment of approximately million  which began to operate during the fourth quarter of we are also continuing the process of implementing a new single business system to replace the existing systems we currently use 
during  we have expensed million and capitalized million associated with the implementation of the new information system 
since the project began in  we have expensed million and capitalized million associated with the implementation of the new information system 
in  we generated million from financing activities which primarily consisted of million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during  our board of directors approved regular quarterly dividends of 
per share that were paid on march  and june  and regular quarterly dividends of 
per share that were paid on september  and december  additionally  the board approved a special dividend of per share that was paid on september  in february  our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 
per share  which is payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  we expect to make regular dividend distributions in the future  subject to the availability of cash and continuing determination by our board of directors that the payment of dividends remains in the best interest of our shareholders 
our secured bank financing agreement is a revolving credit facility collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories and substantially all of our property and equipment 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base  comprised of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  or million in the aggregate 
a may amendment extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to december   with annual extensions at the banks option 
the credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants  the most significant of which include i minimum availability of million  tested monthly  ii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  and a maximum leverage ratio of  which are tested quarterly  iii restrictions on additional indebtedness  and iv limitations on capital expenditures and investments 
the credit facility also contains an accordion feature that allows us to add up to million of additional revolver capacity 
at december   we had approximately million of availability and were in compliance with our covenants under the credit facility 
further declines in steel prices or further reductions in sales volumes in could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants in our revolving credit facility 

table of contents compared to working capital at december  decreased million from the end of the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in prepaids and others and a million increase in cash 
during  we generated million of net cash from operations  of which million was derived from cash earnings and million was generated from working capital 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
we completed a million project to equip and expand our iowa facility by approximately  square feet in order to meet our customers needs for high quality sheet product 
we installed additional laser and plasma cutting equipment and machining centers in cleveland  chicago  chambersburg and siler city to support our growing value added services 
due to the risk of technological obsolescence  it has been our policy to lease new laser cutting equipment 
in  we ordered a million stretcher leveler cut to length line for our minneapolis coil facility  which became operational in the second quarter of we continued the process of implementing a new business information system to replace the existing systems we currently use 
during  our board of directors approved regular quarterly dividends of 
per share that were paid on march  and june  the board of directors then increased the regular quarterly dividend to 
per share  which were paid on september  and december  in december  we advanced million to olp to cover a loan guarantee obligation 
we believe the underlying value of olp s remaining assets  upon liquidation  will be sufficient to repay the advance at a later date 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations less than more than amounts in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations a   unrecognized tax positions b    other long term liabilities c    operating leases d     total contractual obligations a see note to the consolidated financial statements

as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents effects of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of steel and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no

sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement was initially effective as of january   but in february  the fasb delayed the effective date for applying the standard to non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  for assets and liabilities within its scope and the impact was immaterial to our financial statements 
non financial assets and non financial liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of sfas no 
included those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk during the past several years  the base price of carbon flat rolled steel has fluctuated significantly 
we have witnessed unprecedented steel producer price volatility  including a doubling of prices during the first nine months of and rapid and steep price decreases during the fourth quarter of declining or flattening prices  as we have experienced in the fourth quarter of and expect to experience during the first quarter of  could reduce our gross profit margin percentages to levels that are lower than our historical levels or our levels 
higher inventory held by us  other steel service centers or end use customers could cause competitive pressures that could also reduce our gross profit 
higher raw material prices for steel producers or steel production constraints 
table of contents could cause the price of steel to increase 
rising prices result in higher working capital requirements for us and our customers 
some customers may not have sufficient credit lines or liquidity to absorb significant increases in the price of steel 
while we have generally been successful in the past in passing on producers price increases and surcharges to our customers  there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass on price increases to our customers in the future 
approximately of our net sales in were directly to automotive manufacturers or manufacturers of automotive components and parts 
the automotive industry experiences significant fluctuations in demand based on numerous factors such as general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
the automotive industry is also subject  from time to time  to labor work stoppages 
the domestic automotive industry  which has experienced a number of bankruptcies  is currently involved in significant restructuring and labor contract negotiations  which has resulted in lower production volumes 
certain customers in this industry represent an increasing credit risk 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation  excluding increases in the price of steel and increased distribution expense  has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
when raw material prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the steel price increase can be passed on to our customers 
when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower cost product result in lower selling prices 
declining steel prices  as we have experienced during the fourth quarter of and expect to experience during the first quarter of  have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income while increasing steel prices have favorably affected our net sales and net income 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuating steel prices 
we have not entered into any interest rate or steel commodity hedge transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt 
if interest rates in the future were to increase basis points from december  rates and  assuming no change in total debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to us would be approximately thousand 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to variable interest rate risk 
however  we have the option to enter into to day fixed base rate euro loans under our credit facility
