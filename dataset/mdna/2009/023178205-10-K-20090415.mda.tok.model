corporate and other segment our corporate and other segment includes general corporate assets primarily cash and cash equivalents and investments  our reinsurance operations  which reinsures property and casualty risks written by licensed us insurers in the categories of commercial auto liability  commercial physical damage and workers compensation associated with members of highly selective affinity groups or associations  and other activities that are not directly related to our cruise  marine  and travel and events operating segments 
in our reinsurance operations  we reinsure property and casualty risks written by licensed us insurers through our subsidiary  cypress reinsurance  ltd cypress re 
we formed cypress re in december and registered it as a class reinsurer pursuant to section of the bermuda monetary authority act to carry on business in that capacity subject to the provisions of the bermuda monetary authority act 
the lines of business that we reinsure include commercial auto liability  commercial physical damage and workers compensation 
these risks are associated with members of highly selective affinity groups or associations 
prior to entering into reinsurance arrangements  we require the members  whose risk is reinsured under a program  to meet certain loss control program qualifications and pass certain pre qualification criteria as part of the underwriting review by a third party 
our reinsurance transactions are made through quota share agreements in which we agree to accept a certain fixed percentage of premiums written from the ceding company the original insurance carrier and in general assume the same percentage of purchased reinsurance  direct acquisition costs and ultimate incurred claims 
we purchase excess of loss and aggregate stop loss reinsurance to mitigate potential losses from a severe adverse loss development 
we typically retain the first layer of risk on a per policy basis  which ranges from  to  and a third party reinsurance company through excess of loss reinsurance retains the next layer up to the policy limits of million 
above million  we retain losses up to the aggregate reinsurance limit  which varies with each quota share agreement  and the third party reinsurance company pays losses in excess of our aggregate reinsurance limit up to million 
we are responsible for any additional losses in excess of the aggregate reinsurance limit 
as of december   loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred did not exceed our aggregate reinsurance limit on any of our quota share agreements 
we have not entered into any quota share agreements since june and have scaled back any plans to enter any new reinsurance business due to current business conditions in the us economy

see note  subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
we have a minority investment in grand prix tours  inc  which provides packaged tours primarily to formula one  indy car and nascar races in the us and internationally 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million equal to the value of our investment in this entity 
competition the cruise industry is a highly competitive marketplace with several operators providing cruise offerings domestically and internationally 
we compete in terms of price  itineraries  services and ship types 
in addition  cruising is one of several options that people have when selecting a vacation 
we face competition from other vacation operators that provide leisure and vacation alternatives including resorts  hotels and packaged tours 
we believe that we provide a unique experience that is appealing to our target market  but other alternatives may become more appealing 
there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
the marine industry is a competitive marketplace 
we compete with other marina builders  service providers and general contractors in terms of quality  price  product and timing 
we believe that we deliver products superior to those of our competition  and have created a development team  facilities and processes 
table of contents that allow us to exceed our clients expectations 
we believe that our brands are well known for quality within the industry 
there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
the travel and events industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than us 
we believe that  although some potential clients will focus on price alone  other clients will also be interested in the quality of the programs developed and the excellence of the customer service provided 
we believe that we provide a level of service that exceeds our competition 
we compete with respect to price and service  and believe our technology is a key element of our service 
we believe the barriers to entry are relatively low for any future competitors within the travel and events segment of our business due to the limited resources required 
additionally  certain organizations engaged in the travel and events industry have substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
regulation ship maintenance operation of our us flagged ships is subject to regulations established by the us department of transportation that are enforced by the us coast guard and other international class societies 
among these regulations is the requirement that the ships be taken out of operation and removed from the water for inspection of the exterior of the hull on a periodic basis  referred to as drydocking  as well as the performance of certain regularly scheduled maintenance service 
we usually layup our domestic ships in the winter months when they are typically out of operation due to limited demand 
as of december   the queen of the west  columbia queen  contessa  delta queen and the mississippi queen were layed up pending sale of these vessels 
our international ships must be drydocked at least twice every five years and therefore are typically drydocked at preplanned times of low demand 
passenger health  safety and security we are subject to various international  national  state and local laws  regulations and treaties that govern  among other things  safety standards applicable to our ships  health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers  security standards onboard our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our passengers 
these issues are  and we believe will continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities 
this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
various government agencies within the department of homeland security dhs including the transportation security administration  the us coast guard and the us bureau of customs and border protection  have adopted  and may adopt in the future  new rules  policies or regulations or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  rules  policies or regulations  compliance with which could increase our costs or result in loss of revenue 
the coast guard s maritime security regulations  issued pursuant to the maritime transportation security act of  require us to operate our ships and facilities pursuant to both the maritime security regulations and approved security plans 
our ships and facilities are subject to periodic security compliance verification examinations by the coast guard 
a failure to operate in accordance with the maritime security regulations or the approved security plan may result in the imposition of a fine or control and compliance measures  including the suspension or revocation of the security plan  thereby making the ship or facility ineligible to operate 
we are also required to audit these security plans on an annual basis and  if necessary  submit amendments to the coast guard for their review and approval 
failure to timely submit the necessary amendments may lead to the imposition of the fines and control and compliance measures mentioned above 
dhs may adopt additional security related regulations  including new requirements for screening of passengers and our reimbursement to the agency for the cost of security services 
these new security related 
table of contents regulations could adversely affect our ability to efficiently process passengers or could increase our operating costs 
the federal maritime commission regulates passenger ships with or more passenger berths departing from us ports and requires that operators post surety bond to be used if the operator fails to provide cruise services  or otherwise satisfy certain financial standards 
as of december   we have secured a million surety bond as security under the federal maritime commission 
we may in the future be required to make additional financial deposits directly with the federal maritime commission in proportion to advance passenger deposits received 
environmental we are subject to numerous environmental laws 
our marine projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial  legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations 
the applicable regulations  as well as the technology and length of time available to comply with those regulations  continue to develop and change 
in addition  regulations covering our past activities or those of our predecessors could adversely affect us 
us  canadian and various state government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely affect the cruise vacation industry 
some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
current and future environmental laws and regulations  or liabilities arising from past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances or to ship discharges  could increase the cost of compliance or otherwise adversely affect the value of our domestic vessels 
taxation the following summary of the principal united states tax laws applicable to our cruise operations  as well as the conclusions regarding certain issues of tax law  are based on the provisions of the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code  existing and proposed us treasury department regulations  administrative rulings  pronouncements and judicial decisions  all as of the date of this annual report 
no assurance can be given that changes in or interpretation of existing laws will not occur or will not be retroactive or that anticipated future circumstances will in fact occur 
our views should not be considered official  and no assurance can be given that the conclusions discussed below would be sustained if challenged by taxing authorities 
we own and operate our windstar cruise fleet of three bahamian registered cruise vessels through foreign corporations that are subsidiaries of aicg  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours incorporated in the marshall islands 
as a result of special tax elections  these foreign subsidiary corporations are treated as branches of aicg 
therefore  for purposes of the following discussion  aicg and not the subsidiaries will be treated as the owner and operator of the windstar cruise fleet 
taxation to aicg of its cruise income in general aicg derives substantially all of its gross income from the operation of the windstar cruises vessels in international transportation 
this income principally consists of hire for the transportation of passengers  which is referred to herein as cruise income 
cruise income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends  but that does not both begin and end  in the us will be considered to be derived from sources within the united states 
cruise income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the united states  without an intervening non us port of call  will be considered to be derived from sources within the united states 
aicg will not engage in cruise operations that give rise to us source income 
cruise income attributable to 
table of contents transportation exclusively between non us ports will be considered to be derived from sources outside the united states 
cruise income derived from sources outside the us will not be subject to any us federal income tax 
aicg s vessels will operate in various parts of the world  including to or from us ports 
unless exempt from us taxation under section of the code  aicg s us source shipping income will be subject to us federal income taxation under the net and branch tax regime described below 
under section of the code  aicg qualifies for exemption from us federal tax on its us source cruise income derived from its windstar cruises since for more than half the days of the years and i aicg was organized under the laws of the republic of the marshall islands  a foreign country that grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax on cruise income earned by us corporations and ii aicg was a controlled foreign corporation as defined by section of the code cfc and more than of aicg s stock was owned by a us domestic c corporation  namely us 
taxation in the absence of an exemption under section in the absence of an exemption under section  a foreign corporation such as aicg would be subject to either the net income and branch profits tax regimes of section and section of the internal revenue code the net tax regime or the four percent of gross income tax regime of section of the internal revenue code the four percent tax regime 
where the relevant foreign corporation has  or is considered to have  a fixed place of business in the us that is involved in the earning of us source shipping income and substantially all of such us source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation  the net tax regime is applicable 
if the foreign corporation does not have a fixed place of business in the us or substantially all of its us source shipping income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation  the four percent tax regime will apply 
we believe aicg would be subject to the net tax regime in the absence of an exemption under section under the net tax regime  us source shipping income  net of applicable deductions  would be subject to a federal corporate income tax of up to and the net after tax income would be potentially subject to a further branch tax of 
in addition  interest paid by the foreign corporations  if any  would generally be subject to a branch interest tax 
controlled foreign corporation tax regime as the us shareholder of aicg  which as indicated above is a cfc  we are subject to tax under the cfc regime on aicg s subpart f income whether or not aicg makes any distributions of such income to us 
for taxable years beginning on or after january   subpart f income does not include income derived from the international operation of ships 
therefore  none of windstar cruises income is subpart f income 
however  subpart f income does include  among other things  interest and other passive investment income  income from the sale or purchase of certain goods to or from a related party  certain income from the provision of services to a related party and any increase in our investments in certain property located in the us inclusions of subpart f income will increase our adjusted basis in our stock interests in aicg 
any subsequent distributions of earnings and profits attributable to previously included subpart f income will be non taxable to us and will reduce our adjusted basis in our aicg stock interests 
our gain on the disposition of our aicg stock would be treated as a dividend to the extent of the aicg s untaxed earnings and profits 

table of contents reinsurance capital requirement under bermuda regulations  cypress re is required to maintain a surplus of of gross written premiums or of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  or million  whichever is greater 
as of december   cypress re had million in total statutory capital and surplus which exceeded the required statutory capital and surplus of million 
in april  we reduced our capital by million based on authority from bermuda 
insurance we maintain a variety of insurance coverage for the operations of our businesses  including but not limited to coverage for professional and general liability 
we also maintain insurance coverage on our ships  real property and personal property  and as required on leased properties 
we carry marine liability insurance on our ships through various mutual protection and indemnity associations 
our marine liability insurance arrangements are typical of common marine industry practices and  subject to certain deductibles  provide coverage for losses  other than hull physical damage losses  including casualty damage by the ships and claims by crew members  passengers and other third parties 
as a member of mutual protection and indemnity associations  we pay our annual premiums based largely on our risk characteristics and loss experience  and the loss experience of other members 
in addition  because such associations and other maritime mutual indemnity associations around the world pool a portion of their loss experience in risk sharing arrangements  these associations also may be affected by the loss experience of other mutual protection and indemnity organizations 
in addition to this pooling arrangement  these associations have additional independent reinsurance protection 
our annual protection and indemnity insurance premium consists of annual mutual premiums 
we may be liable for supplemental premiums in excess of the anticipated amount in the event that an association incurs heavy losses or experiences unusual circumstances 
we also carry a multi line marine and non marine package policy that is underwritten by various insurers 
this package policy provides hull and machinery coverage that insures against physical loss and damage to the windstar ships  subject to various deductibles 
the ships are insured for their appraised value 
although we believe the risk of a total loss of our ships is remote  in all likelihood  the replacement costs would significantly exceed these coverage limits 
additionally  this package policy provides coverage against loss of revenue and extra expenses incurred in connection with a marine casualty or other covered interruption in service  subject to various deductibles 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate based on our assessment of the risks to be insured  the probabilities of loss and the relative cost of available coverages 
however  there can be no assurance that the insurance we maintain will be adequate in the event of a claim  or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or at reasonable prices 
environment we are subject to federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each country where we have a business presence 
although we continue to make capital expenditures for environmental protection  we do not anticipate any significant expenditure in order to comply with such laws and regulations that would have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position 
we are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we cannot assure you  however  that environmental problems relating to properties owned or operated by us will not develop in the future  and we cannot predict whether any such problems  if they were to develop  could require significant expenditures on our part 
in addition  we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future with respect to environmental protection and waste disposal 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed employees of whom were full time employees and were part time employees 
our employees are primarily located in the states of california  florida  georgia  illinois  oregon  pennsylvania  washington  the countries of australia  england  new zealand  france  spain  philippines and indonesia  and various other individual offices throughout the us and the world 
we have full time employees engaged in management  construction  marketing and sales  operations  administration and finance 
we also employ temporary labor on a periodic basis to assist with our operations due to the seasonal nature of our cruise and travel and events businesses 
none of our us employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements or is represented by a union 
we believe that our labor relations are good 
our international crews of windstar cruises are members of certain international unions established by their countries of origin 
seasonality our businesses are seasonal 
prior to  the majority of our operating results were recognized in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year  which corresponds to the busy season for our travel and events services 
as a result of the acquisitions within our cruise segment and the size of our cruise operations in relation to our overall operations  beginning in  a majority of our operating results are expected to be recognized in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  which coincides with the cruising season 
our future annual results could be adversely affected if our revenue were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of the year

item a 
risk factors you should consider carefully the specific risk factors set forth below and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  as these are important factors  among others  that could cause our actual results to differ from our expected or historical results 
you should note that the risks described below are not the only risks that we face 
the risks listed below are only those risks relating to our operations that we consider to be material 
there may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or that we are not currently aware of  that could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and investors could lose the money they paid to buy our common stock 

table of contents risks related to our company and our industry if we are not successful at a combination of selling our non windstar cruises assets  raising additional financing and or renegotiating existing debt obligations in order to raise funds for operations  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
due to the current global downturn in the economy  specifically the decrease in vacationers discretionary spending and the direct impact this has on the reduction in cruise bookings  decrease in corporate spending on incentive programs and the tightening effect of the credit market on financing for construction projects  we will need additional sources of cash in the immediate future in order to fund operations in accordingly  in february  we announced our intention to sell our non windstar cruises related assets  including the operations of marine  travel and events  majestic america line and insurance operations 
we hired an investment banking firm who is actively marketing the non windstar cruise assets for immediate sale 
in addition to the sale of assets  we are also seeking additional financing sources and renegotiating existing debt obligations 
based on the terms of the asset sales or additional financing  if any  our stockholders may have additional dilution 
the amount of dilution could be attributed to the issuance of warrants or securities with other dilutive characteristics  such as anti dilution clauses or price resets 
although we are in discussions with potential buyers and other prospects for additional funds  we currently have no completed funding commitments or sale transactions 
if we are not able to sell our non windstar cruises assets  raise additional financing and or renegotiate existing debt obligations in order to raise funds for operations  we will be forced to extend payment terms with vendors where possible  and or to suspend or curtail certain of our planned operations and possibly seek protection in bankruptcy 
any of these actions would harm our business  results of operations and future prospects  could cause our debt obligations to be accelerated and could result in potential damages on existing contracts within our marine and travel and events divisions 
as a result of our need for additional financing and other factors  the report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we cease to continue as a going concern  due to lack of available capital or otherwise  you may lose your entire investment in our company 
the change in strategic direction to focus on our cruise division requires us to execute the orderly divestiture of our marine and travel and events divisions in a difficult transactional atmosphere 
the current credit turmoil being experienced throughout the united states lending sector has reduced the ability of viable bidders to engage in mergers and acquisitions 
we have stated our strategic focus on the windstar cruises portion of our cruise division and are currently in the process of selling our marine division  travel and events division  majestic america line and insurance business 
failure to consummate these divestitures will result in a reduction of liquidity for the cruise division and will prolong operational costs associated with consolidating our businesses 
the adverse impact of the continuing worldwide economic downturn on the demand for cruises could adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the demand for cruises is affected by international  national and local economic conditions 
the current worldwide economic downturn has had an adverse effect on vacationers discretionary spending and consumer confidence which has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns  decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry 
we cannot predict the extent or duration of this downturn or the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery 
however  if the downturn continues for an extended period of time or worsens  we could experience a prolonged period of booking slowdowns  depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 
this would adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition including the impairment of the value of our ships and other intangible assets 

table of contents in connection with our acquisitions within the cruise segment  we assumed or incurred a significant amount of indebtedness  which could adversely affect our cash flows and business 
in  we obtained million in seller financing from our acquisition of windstar cruises  payable at through the windstar cruises seller financing was paid in full in april through the use of proceeds received from a million offering of senior convertible notes due april  interest on the convertible notes is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october in each year  commencing october  as a result of this debt  demands on our cash resources have increased 
the increased levels of debt could  among other things require us to dedicate the majority of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions and other purposes  increase our vulnerability to  and limit flexibility in planning for  adverse economic and industry conditions  adversely affect our credit rating  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  additional acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with less indebtedness  and limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the repayment of debt 
we may not be able to make interest payments on our senior convertible notes 
in connection with our senior convertible notes  we are required to make scheduled interest payments amounting to million semi annually in arrears on april and october in each year  commencing october  we did not make a million scheduled interest payment due and payable on april  on our senior convertible notes 
we have until may  to cure this default 
if we are unable to make the scheduled interest payments an event of default will occur and the trustee or the holders of not less than in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding notes to be due and payable immediately 
our financial performance is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us 
our businesses are seasonal 
we recognize cruise related revenues at the completion of the cruise 
we recognize revenue for marine and related services in accordance with the respective contracts 
we recognize travel and event related revenues in the month a program operates 
we recognize insurance premiums as revenue over the period of the insurance contracts in proportion to the amount of the insurance coverage provided 
prior to  the majority of our operating results were recognized in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year  which corresponds to the busy season in our travel and events segment 
as a result of the acquisitions within our cruise segment and the size of our cruise operations in relation to our overall operations  a majority of our operating results will be recognized in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  which coincides with the cruising season 
our future annual results could be adversely affected if our revenue were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including our ability to effectively and efficiently operate our cruise operations  customer cancellation rates  competitive conditions in the industries in which we operate  marketing expenses  
table of contents extreme weather conditions  timing of and costs related to acquisitions  the impact of new laws and regulations affecting our business  negative incidents involving cruise ships  including those involving the health and safety of passengers  cruise ship maintenance problems  reduced consumer demand for vacations and cruise vacations  changes in fuel  food  payroll  insurance and security costs  the availability of raw materials  our ability to enter into profitable marina construction contracts  changes in relationships with certain travel providers  changes in vacation industry capacity  the mix of programs and events  program destinations and event locations  the introduction and acceptance of new programs and program and event enhancements by us and our competitors  other economic factors and other considerations affecting the travel industry  potential claims related to our reinsurance business  the potentially volatile nature of the reinsurance business  and other factors discussed in this annual report on form k 
as a result of these and other factors  our operations and financial condition could suffer  which could cause our annual or quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
if we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors  our financial condition will suffer 
the cruise  marine and travel and events industries are highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of other companies that provide similar products and services 
as a result of our cruise acquisitions  we operate in the vacation market  and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation 
we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines  but also to other vacation operators that provide other leisure options  including hotels  resorts and package holidays and tours 
we face significant competition from other cruise lines  both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to cruise passengers 
we believe the barriers to entry within some of the industries in which we operate are relatively low 
certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources than we do 
as a result  there can be no assurance that our present competitors or competitors that elect to enter the marketplace in the future will not exert significant competitive pressures on us 
these competitive factors could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by events adversely affecting the travel industry  including the effects of general economic conditions 
a substantial portion of our operations is directly associated with the travel industry 
demand for travel and vacation is dependent on the underlying strength of the economy 
as a result  our operations are subject to special risks inherent in doing business in that industry 
adverse changes in the economic climate  such as higher fuel prices  higher interest rates and changes in governmental policies could reduce the discretionary income of our potential cruise passengers or companies scheduling conventions  trade shows or meetings 
consequently  this could negatively affect demand for vacations  including cruise vacations  and for travel  events or conventions  all of which are discretionary purchases 
in addition  the travel industry is highly susceptible to unforeseen events  such as wars  acts of terrorism  civil disturbances  political instability  governmental activities and deprivation of contract rights 
demand for our products and services may also be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as hurricanes  earthquakes  epidemics and flooding in regions in which we offer our products and provide our services 
periods of instability or uncertainty surrounding the travel industry may reduce the demand for our programs and services and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success in our travel and events business is highly dependent upon unaffiliated travel services suppliers with whom we have limited agreements 
in order to provide our services and products  we depend on airlines  hotels and other suppliers of travel and processing services 
we have limited agreements with our travel suppliers and vendors that obligate such suppliers or vendors to process or sell services or products through us 
we rely to a large extent on scheduled commercial airline services to get our customers to our cruise ships and  therefore  increases in the price of  or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service  could undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages 
restricted access to suppliers and vendors of travel services and processing  or a reduction in capacity or changes in pricing or collateral arrangements with travel suppliers or vendors could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry  a reduction in demand or economic uncertainties could adversely affect our revenues and profitability and impair our asset values 
cruising capacity has grown in recent years  and we expect it to increase further as cruise vacation companies introduce new ships 
demand for cruises has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on economic conditions 
economic changes may reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy and or price discounting which  in turn  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and impair our asset values 
our business could be adversely affected by unanticipated casualty losses 
due to the nature of our businesses  we may be subject to liability claims arising out of accidents or disasters causing injury to our customers  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
although we have never experienced a liability loss for which we did not have adequate insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the insurance carrier will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at acceptable premium levels in the future 
successful assertion against us of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding our insurance  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that our insurance costs will not escalate 
our protection and indemnity insurance is provided by various mutual protection and indemnity associations 
as associations  they rely on member premiums  investment reserves and income  and reinsurance to manage liability risks on behalf of their members 
increased investment losses  underwriting losses or reinsurance costs could cause domestic or international marine insurance associations to substantially raise the 
table of contents cost of premiums  resulting not only in higher premium costs  but also higher levels of deductibles 
increases in our premiums or deductible levels could adversely affect our operating costs 
we are dependent upon key personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and certain other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial  operational  marketing and customer service personnel 
the failure to retain and attract necessary managerial  operational  marketing and customer service personnel could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success in our international cruise business is highly dependent on our third party vessel management company 
in conjunction with our acquisition of windstar cruises  we engaged the services of v 
ships leisure v 
ships for the vessel management of our internationally flagged ships 
management services consist of deck  engine and hotel crew management  procurement and technical and hotel operations 
we rely on the expertise of our third party provider and the failure to adequately integrate  manage and monitor the operations of v 
ships could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
international political and other world events affecting safety and security could adversely affect the demand for cruises  which could harm our future sales and profitability 
demand for cruises and other vacation options has been  and is expected to continue to be  affected by the public s attitude towards the safety and security of travel 
events such as the terrorist attacks in the us on september  and the threats of additional attacks in the us and elsewhere  concerns of an outbreak of additional hostilities and national government travel advisories  together with the resulting political instability and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling  have had a significant adverse effect on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry and may continue to do so in the future 
decreases in demand could lead to price discounting which  in turn  could reduce the profitability of our business 
incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could adversely affect our reputation and harm our future sales and profitability 
the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents  including those caused by the improper operation of our ships  passenger and crew illnesses such as the spread of contagious diseases  mechanical failures  fires  collisions  inappropriate crew or passenger behavior  weather events  security breaches and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety  health  security and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance and expose us to claims by those that may be harmed 
for example  our queen of the west experienced an engine fire in april which resulted in nine cancelled sailings and our empress of the north ran aground in may during a cruise  requiring us to cancel twelve non consecutive cruises and end the sailing season early 
our empress of the north also ran aground in march during a cruise  requiring us to cancel three cruises 
in addition  we experienced an outbreak of norovirus on our mississippi queen in october  requiring us to cancel three cruises 
it is possible that we could be forced to alter itineraries or cancel a cruise or a series of cruises due to these or other factors  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition due to loss of revenue from cancellations passenger relocation  crew expenses  ship repairs and passenger refunds or other accommodations 
incidents involving cruise ships  adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry  events such as terrorist attacks  war and other hostilities  or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters  such as storms and earthquakes  could impact demand and consequently adversely affect our profitability 

table of contents if we do not complete drydocking on schedule or if ship mechanical faults result in unscheduled drydockings and repairs  we will incur additional expenses and may also lose revenues by canceling planned cruises 
when we drydock one of our cruise ships as is required for inspection of the exterior of the hull on a periodic basis  we lose the revenue from that ship s operations for the period it is out of service 
we also incur the additional cost of the drydocking 
also  our cruise ships from time to time experience mechanical problems or extended or extraordinary maintenance 
mechanical faults or extended maintenance may result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs 
for example  in november our wind star was placed into a scheduled drydock that required more repairs than originally anticipated  which caused a significant budget overrun 
our wind spirit experienced an oil leak due to a broken seal in the controllable pitch propeller in december  which caused us to cancel one sailing 
these  events together with any related adverse publicity  could adversely affect our financial results 
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our profits by reducing our sales of cruise vacations 
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation 
the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  existing capacity constraints  security concerns  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial limitations on port development  local government regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities 
any limitations on the availability of our ports of call could adversely affect our profits by reducing our sales of cruise vacations 
the nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes  which may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 
we engage in construction activities for marina facilities where design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties 
we and or our subsidiaries have been and may in the future be named as defendants in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters 
these claims generally arise in the normal course of our business 
when it is determined that we have liability  we may not be covered by insurance or  if covered  the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
in addition  even where insurance is maintained for such exposures  the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims 
any liability not covered by our insurance  in excess of our insurance limits or  if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible  could result in a significant loss for us  which claims may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 
an inability to obtain bonding could limit the number of projects our marine division is able to pursue 
as is customary in the marina construction industry  we often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts  development agreements and other arrangements 
our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and certain external factors  including the overall capacity of the surety market and the financial condition of our overall enterprise 
surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
since  the surety industry has undergone significant changes  with several companies withdrawing completely from the industry or significantly reducing their bonding commitment 
in addition  certain reinsurers of surety risk have limited their participation in this market 
therefore  we could be unable to obtain or meet our current obligations under existing surety bonds when required  which could adversely affect our future results of operations and revenues by limiting the number of projects we are able to pursue 

table of contents supply shortages and other risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries 
our ability to conduct and expand our marina construction operations is dependent on access to construction materials and skilled labor 
increased prices or shortages of materials such as cement  aluminum and wood would cause increases in construction costs and construction delays 
labor disputes or increased costs or shortages of skilled labor could also cause increases in costs and delays 
prices and supplies may be further adversely affected by natural disasters and adverse weather conditions 
we estimate and forecast costs as part of our business  and attempt to plan for possible cost increases due to changes in prices or availability of materials or labor 
however  generally we are unable to pass on unanticipated increases in construction costs to customers who have already entered into sales contracts  as those sales contracts generally fix the price of the project at the time the contract is signed  which may be well in advance of the construction work 
significant unexpected increases in costs of materials or labor may adversely affect our results of operations 
the demand  timing and funding of marina construction awards and other factors could lead to unpredictable operating results 
our marina construction operations are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing demand for marina construction projects  the timing and funding of new projects  the length of time over which construction contracts are to be performed  the ability to meet performance schedules  cost overruns and cancellations or changes in the scope of existing contracts 
as a result of these uncertainties  the operating results related to our marine business could be unpredictable and inconsistent from period to period 
we may incur costs related to repairing defects in marinas we design and construct  which could adversely affect our profitability 
our marina construction operations are subject to warranty and other claims related to design and construction defects and related issues  including compliance with construction codes 
the costs we incur to resolve those warranties and other claims could reduce our profitability  and if we were to experience an unusually high level of claims  or unusually severe claims  our profitability could be adversely affected 
natural disasters  severe weather conditions and forces in nature beyond our control could adversely affect our marina construction and management operations 
our marina construction and management operations are conducted in many areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather  such as hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  floods  tsunamis and fires 
we also may be affected by unforeseen engineering  environmental  or geological problems 
these conditions could delay or increase the cost of construction projects  damage or reduce the availability of materials  and negatively impact the demand for marinas in affected areas 
if our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events  our earnings  liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues or profits 
under our accounting procedures  we measure and recognize our marina construction profits and revenues under the percentage of completion accounting methodology 
this methodology allows us to recognize revenues and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred 
the effect of revisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated  and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material 
given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made  which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits 

table of contents unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions  increased costs and potential losses 
our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions beyond our control 
in our marine operations  we currently operate in australia  spain  new zealand  france  united kingdom  mexico  canada  bahamas  malaysia  china and singapore 
with the addition of windstar cruises  we began offering itineraries with destinations in costa rica  greece  spain  portugal  turkey  italy  france  british virgin islands  barbados  french west indies  grenada and other foreign ports of call 
we anticipate that our foreign destinations will change and expand over time 
operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations  embargoes  trade restrictions  tax treatment  us government policies relating to foreign operations  and international hostilities 
we also face significant risks due to civil strife  acts of war  terrorism and insurrection 
our level of exposure to these risks varies with respect to each project  depending on the particular stage of each project 
for example  our risk exposure with respect to a marina construction project in an early development stage will generally be less than our risk exposure with respect to a project in the middle of construction 
to the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions  we may experience project disruptions and losses 
project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could increase our us dollar costs or reduce our us dollar revenues 
our international contracts are typically denominated in foreign currencies  which results in our foreign operations facing the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our us dollar costs for  or reduce our us dollar revenues from  our foreign operations 
any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our profits 
we expect to face significant and increasing costs to maintain our ships as they age and may have difficulty replacing our ships when needed  which could adversely affect our result of operations and financial condition 
we believe that the costs to maintain our fleet of ships will increase over time 
the average age of our ships is approximately years 
we expect to incur increasing expenses to operate and maintain our ships in good condition as they age 
eventually  our ships will need to be replaced 
we may not be able to replace our ships with new ships based on uncertainties related to financing  timing and shipyard availability 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could suffer liquidity problems or be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our marina construction contracts  at times we commit resources to marina projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on client projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
customer defaults in making payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents our business could be adversely affected by losses associated with our reinsurance operations 
we currently reinsure property and casualty risks written by licensed us insurers 
the lines of business that are being reinsured include commercial auto liability  commercial physical damage and workers compensation 
if a loss event occurs that we are required by our agreements to cover  the amount of our cash and cash equivalents will be reduced  and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer 
environmental  health and safety  financial responsibility  tax and maritime and homeland security legislation and other laws and regulations could adversely affect us by restricting our operations increasing our operating costs 
as described in item  business regulation  we are subject to numerous laws and regulations covering various aspects of our businesses 
compliance or failure to comply with those or future laws and regulations could be costly and could restrict our operations 
for example  the us  canada and various state government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely affect the cruise vacation industry 
some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
current and future environmental laws and regulations  or liabilities arising from past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances or to ship discharges  could increase our cost of compliance  subject us to civil and criminal liabilities or otherwise adversely affect our businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  regulations and treaties that govern safety standards applicable to our ships  health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers  security standards onboard our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our passengers continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities  which could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
the federal maritime commission requires that operators of ships with or more passenger berths departing from us ports post surety bonds to be used if the operator fails to provide cruise services  or otherwise satisfy certain financial standards 
we have secured a million surety bond as security under the federal maritime commission 
our ability to continue to secure such a security instrument in the future may result in undue burden on us and may require that we make additional financial deposits directly with the federal maritime commission in proportion to advance passenger deposits received 
since january   us citizens have been required to carry a passport or  when available  a pass card  for travel by land or sea to or from certain countries and areas that previously were exempt from passport requirements  such as the caribbean  canada and mexico 
since many cruise customers visiting these destinations may not currently have passports or may not obtain a pass card when available  it is likely that this will have some negative effect on our bookings and future net revenue yields 
a failure to operate in accordance with the coast guard s maritime security regulations or an approved security plan may result in the imposition of a fine or control and compliance measures  including the suspension or revocation of the security plan  thereby making the ship or facility ineligible to operate 
we are also required to audit these security plans on an annual basis and  if necessary  submit amendments to the coast guard for their review and approval 
failure to timely submit the necessary amendments may lead to the imposition of the fines and control and compliance measures mentioned above 
dhs may adopt additional security related regulations  including new requirements for screening of passengers and our reimbursement to the agency for the cost of security services 
these new security related regulations could adversely affect our ability to efficiently process passengers or could increase our operating costs 
in addition  we may be subject to fines or other penalties for failure to comply with laws and regulations of one or more states requiring licensing  qualification or other action 
increases in taxes and regulatory 
table of contents compliance costs could adversely affect our results of operations because we may not be able to recover these increased costs through price increases of our cruise vacations 
we may be subject to significantly higher us income taxes if we do not qualify for exemption from tax or for deferral of tax under us tax laws in respect of windstar cruises income 
changes under the code may adversely affect the us federal income taxation of our us source shipping income derived from our windstar cruises 
in addition  changes in other countries or states income or other tax laws  regulations or treaties in respect of our windstar cruises could also adversely affect our net income 
we believe that substantially all of the us source shipping income of our windstar cruises qualifies for exemption under section of the code 
we further believe that substantially all of the income derived by our windstar cruises qualifies for deferral from tax  until repatriated by dividend or otherwise  back to the united states under the controlled foreign corporation cfc regime of the code 
however  if as a result of changes in the law  we do not qualify for exemption from tax under section  or qualify for deferral of tax under the cfc regime  in respect of our windstar cruises income  we would have significantly higher us income tax expenses 
in addition  changes in the income or other tax laws affecting our cruise businesses elsewhere could result in higher income and or other taxes  such as value added taxes  being levied on our cruise operations  thus resulting in lower net income 
for additional information see taxation under part i  item business 
additional risks related to our stock if we fail to continue to meet all applicable continued listing requirements of the nasdaq global market and nasdaq determines to delist our common stock  the market liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market 
in order to maintain that listing  we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements 
for example  nasdaq rules require that we maintain a minimum bid price of per share for our common stock 
our common stock is currently and has in the past fallen below this minimum bid price requirement and it may do so again in the future 
nasdaq has currently suspended this bid price requirement through july  however  if nasdaq does not further extend this suspension and our stock price is below at the time the suspension is lifted or falls below after that time or if we in the future fail to meet other requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq global select market  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq global select market if we are unable to cure the events of noncompliance in a timely or effective manner 
if our common stock were threatened with delisting from the nasdaq global market  we may  depending on the circumstances  seek to extend the period for regaining compliance with nasdaq listing requirements by moving our common stock to the nasdaq capital market 
for example  if appropriate  we may request  approval by our stockholders to implement a reverse stock split in order to regain compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement 
if our common stock is not eligible for quotation on another market or exchange  trading of our common stock could be conducted in the over the counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the pink sheets or the otc bulletin board 
in such event  it could become more difficult to dispose of  or obtain accurate quotations for the price of our common stock  and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further 
in addition  in the event that our common stock is delisted  we would be in default under the terms and conditions of our convertible debt 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
these provisions may delay or prevent the acquisition of us  even if the acquisition may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  who are responsible for appointing the members of our management 
provisions in our charter documents may make a change of control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock  without any vote or action by our stockholders 
thus  our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock 
these rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company 
in addition  a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of our having three classes of directors 
our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors  whereby directors serve for three year terms  with approximately one third of the directors coming up for re election each year 
having a staggered board of directors makes it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest  which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors 
additionally  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us in certain circumstances 
section of the delaware general corporation law provides that  subject to specified exceptions  a delaware corporation may not engage in business combinations with any entity that acquires enough shares of our common stock without the consent of our board of directors to be considered an interested stockholder under delaware law for a three year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
neither our certificate of incorporation or bylaws contains an election  as permitted by delaware law  to be exempt from the requirements of section us ownership requirements and transferability limitations may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock 
we have added restrictions to our certificate of incorporation limiting the transferability of our common stock or control to non us citizens to preserve our us flagged status 
we believe that such limitations may have the effect of decreasing the liquidity of our common stock  thereby making it more difficult for investors to dispose of their shares in an orderly manner 
we may also add legends to our stock certificates to indicate the citizenship of our stockholders to facilitate our ability to monitor and control our us citizenship 
such provisions and the level of ownership by insiders and our largest stockholders  we believe  may deter a change in control and limit non us citizens  including corporations and individuals  purchases of our common stock 
future sales of shares of our common stock underlying derivative securities could cause our stock price to decline 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for sale will have on the market price prevailing from time to time 
as of april   we had outstanding  shares of common stock 
a substantial number of these shares are 
table of contents eligible or registered for public resale 
sales of these underlying shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that those sales may occur  could cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease or to be lower than it might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant price and volume volatility and is likely to continue to experience significant volatility in the future 
this volatility may impair our ability to finance strategic transactions with our stock and otherwise harm our business the closing price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share during the year ended december  on march  our closing stock price was which was the lowest level in our company s history 
our stock price is likely to experience significant volatility in the future as a result of numerous factors outside our control 
significant declines in our stock price may interfere with our ability to raise additional funds through equity financing or to finance strategic transactions with our stock 
we have historically used equity incentive compensation as part of our overall compensation arrangements 
the effectiveness of equity incentive compensation in retaining key employees may be adversely impacted by volatility in our stock price 
in addition  there may be increased risk of securities litigation following periods of fluctuations in our stock price 
these and other consequences of volatility in our stock price could have the effect of diverting management s attention and could materially harm our business  and could be exacerbated by the current worldwide financial crisis

item selected financial data not applicable 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview throughout and  we operated as a cruise  marine and travel and events company 
our cruise operations included us flagged cruise ships that sailed along the inland rivers and coastal waterways of north america and international flagged ships that sail to destinations in the caribbean  europe  the americas and the greek isles 
in april  we announced our intention to sell the majestic america line operations and not operate any of the ships under the majestic america line brand in in february  we announced our intention to focus solely on windstar cruises 
we plan to sell all non windstar cruises related assets including our majestic america line assets that we announced in april  in order to concentrate our efforts on our international small ship luxury segment 
we believe that windstar cruises has the most potential long term growth for our shareholders and believe that a successful sale of our other businesses would provide us with 
table of contents stability in a difficult economy 
we have engaged third party firms to facilitate the sale of our non windstar cruises assets 
through our marine business  in and  we were a global provider of marina design and construction services 
our marine business also offered marine operations  shipyard services  management and consulting services to marina owners 
through our travel and events business  we provided event services to corporations  associations and trade show companies 
in addition  we developed  marketed  and managed performance improvement programs utilizing travel incentives and merchandise awards designed to achieve specific corporate objectives  including achieving sales goals  improving productivity and attracting and retaining qualified employees 
our clients included fortune companies  and other large and small businesses 
we also reinsured property and casualty risks written by licensed us insurers 
the lines of business that were being reinsured include commercial auto liability  commercial physical damage and workers compensation 
these risks are associated with members of highly selective affinity groups or associations 
in and  we completed several major acquisitions in the cruise and marine segments 
in  we successfully integrated both the marine acquisitions  as well as the acquisition of windstar cruises 
the integration of our domestic cruise operations proved to be more challenging than anticipated and resulted in a significant loss for the years ended december  and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those which impact our most critical accounting policies  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  within the framework of current accounting literature 
our businesses are seasonal 
historically  we have recognized the majority of our operating results in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year 
as a result of our cruise related acquisitions and the size of our cruise operations in relation to our overall operations  the majority of our operating results will be recognized in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year  which coincide with our cruising season 
our annual results would be adversely affected if our revenue were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of a year 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe require the most significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with gaap  including sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred 
passenger ticket revenue and onboard and other cruise revenues passenger ticket revenue is recorded net of applicable discounts 
passenger ticket revenue and related costs of revenue are recognized when the cruise is completed 
we generally receive from our customers a partially refundable deposit within one week of booking a tour  with the balance typically remitted days prior to the departure date 
if customers cancel their trips  the nonrefundable portion of their deposit is recognized as revenue on the date of cancellation 
passenger revenue representing travel insurance purchased at the time of reservation is recognized upon the completion of the cruise or passenger cancellation  whichever is earlier and our obligation has been met 
onboard and other cruise revenue are comprised of beverage and 
table of contents souvenir sales and optional shore excursions are deferred and recognized as revenue when the cruise is completed 
marine revenue we recognize revenue for marine and related services and shipyard related revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and production type contracts 
contract costs include direct labor  materials  subcontractors and other direct costs  plus estimated indirect costs such as equipment rental  repairs and depreciation and overhead 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenues on fixed price marine construction contracts using the percentage of completion method  whereby a portion of the contract revenue  based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion based on our estimates  is recognized as revenue each period 
revenues on cost plus contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred  plus the estimated fee earned 
estimates of fees earned are based on negotiated fee amounts or our assessment of the fee amounts that are likely to be earned 
each of these methods approximate percentage of completion revenue recognition based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at completion 
we use the completed contract method for shipyard related contracts for which reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made 
on occasion  we or our customers may seek to modify a contract to accommodate a change in the scope of the work  such as changes in specifications  method or manner of performance  equipment  materials  or period of performance  or to account for customer caused delays  errors in specifications or design  contract terminations  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
such change orders or claims are evaluated according to their characteristics and the circumstances under which they occur  taking into consideration such factors as the probability of recovery  our experience in negotiating change orders and claims  and the adequacy of documentation substantiating the costs of such change order or claim 
costs attributable to unpriced change orders and claims are accounted for as costs of contract performance in the period in which the costs are incurred  and revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred 
revenue in excess of costs attributable to unpriced change orders is recorded when realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt  based on our experience with the customer or when a bona fide pricing offer has been provided by the customer 
receivables related to unpriced change orders and claims are not material 
we follow these revenue recognition methods because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue  costs and profits applicable to various stages of a contract can generally be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time  or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then profit may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
on a regular basis  we review contract performance  costs incurred  and estimated costs to complete 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are reflected in income in the period in which the loss becomes known 
a contract may be regarded as substantially completed if remaining costs and potential risks are insignificant in amount 
we consider a contract to be substantially completed upon delivery of the product  acceptance by the customer and compliance with contract performance specifications 
the asset  costs plus earnings in excess of billings on construction contracts  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability  billings in excess of costs plus earnings on construction contracts  represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
travel and event related we bill travel participants  mainly consisting of large corporations  in advance  of which the cash received is recorded as a participant deposit 
we pay for certain direct program costs such as airfare  hotel and other program costs in advance of travel  which are recorded as prepaid program costs 
we recognize travel revenue 
table of contents and related costs when travel convenes and classify such revenue as travel and incentive related 
this revenue is reported on a net basis  reflecting the net effect of gross billings to the client less any direct program costs 
revenue from hotel reservation  registration and related travel services is recognized when the convention operates 
revenue from the sale of merchandise is recognized when the merchandise is shipped  the service has been provided or when the redemption periods have expired 
revenue from pre paid  certificate based merchandise incentive programs is deferred until our obligations are fulfilled or upon management s estimates based upon historical trends that it is remote that the certificate will be redeemed 
these revenues are reported on a net basis  reflecting the net effect of gross billings to the client less any direct program or merchandise costs 
net insurance premiums earned insurance premiums are recognized as revenue over the period of the insurance contracts in proportion to the amount of the insurance coverage provided 
the insurance contracts are typically twelve months in duration and are considered short duration contracts 
unearned premiums represent the unearned portion of the insurance contracts as of the balance sheet date 
ceded reinsurance premiums relate to reinsurance purchased excess of loss and aggregate stop loss to mitigate potential losses from severe adverse loss development  both on a per accident claim basis and in the aggregate 
these ceded reinsurance transactions are recognized as a reduction of premium revenue in the same manner in which the insurance contract is recognized as premium revenue 
license fees revenue from license fees is recognized based on a contracted percentage of total program receipts recorded from the licensing source 
property  vessel and equipment property  vessel and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
cost of maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred 
major additions and betterments are capitalized 
our ships are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over the expected useful life ranging up to years  net of a residual value which generally is approximately 
ship replacement parts are capitalized and depreciated upon being placed in service 
office and shop equipment is capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over the expected useful life of the equipment  ranging up to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the expected useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our estimate of their undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the excess  if any  of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
when property and equipment are sold or retired  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations 
judgments and estimates made related to property and equipment are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in resale values and changes in operating performance 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
all of our property  vessels and equipment were subject to impairment testing as of december   and only the assets related to the marine division were deemed to be impaired 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
management evaluates recoverability using both subjective and objective factors 
subjective factors include the evaluation of industry and product trends and our strategic focus 
objective factors include management s best estimates of projected future earnings and cash flows 
we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair market 
table of contents value of each of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangibles when performing our impairment tests 
assumptions used include growth rates for revenues and expenses  investment yields on deposits  any future capital expenditure requirements and appropriate discount rates 
we established reporting units based on our current reporting structure 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it related to each reporting unit 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
the majority of our intangible assets were assigned lives based on contract values associated with each intangible asset 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from three to years depending on the contract term where applicable 
in connection with our december  impairment testing  the trade name and goodwill associated with our marine division reporting unit were deemed to be impaired and written off 
reserve for loss and loss adjustment reserves the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses includes an amount determined from loss reports and individual cases and an amount for losses incurred but not reported 
such liabilities are based on estimates and  while we believe that the amount is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts provided 
anticipated deductible recoveries from insureds are recorded as reinsurance recoverables at the time the liability for unpaid claims is established 
other recoveries on unsettled claims  such as salvage and subrogation  are estimated by management and adjusted upon collection 
reinsurance in the normal course of our reinsurance business  we seek to reduce the loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the reinsured policy 
with respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts  the amount by which the liabilities associated with the reinsured policies exceed the amounts paid is amortized to income over the estimated remaining settlement period 
the effects of subsequent changes in estimated or actual cash flows are accounted for by adjusting the previously deferred amount to the balance that would have existed had the revised estimate been available at the inception of the reinsurance transaction  with a corresponding charge or credit to income 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the fair value approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the fair value approach described in sfas no 
in  we used the black scholes merton formula to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
we adopted sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method  beginning january  based on the terms of our plans  we did not have a cumulative effect of accounting change related to our plans 
we also elected to continue to estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes merton formula 
using the black scholes merton formula to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  risk free interest rates  our dividend yield and the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in making such determination  a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
however  due to the cumulative three year historical losses generated as of the conclusion of and  sfas no 
largely precludes us from taking into consideration future outlook or forecasted income due to our limited operating history in our domestic cruise business 
we concluded that sfas no 
required that the valuation allowance equal of our deferred tax assets at december  and the establishment of a valuation allowance does not have any impact on cash  nor does such an allowance preclude us from utilizing loss carry forwards on our deferred tax assets in the future 
we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state liabilities 
our estimates may include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare our income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
windstar cruises is primarily engaged in the international operations of ships 
generally  income from the international operation of ships is subject to preferential tax regimes in the countries where the ship owning companies are incorporated and exempt from income tax in other countries where the ships call due to the application of income tax treaties or  in the case of the united states  section of the internal revenue code 
income earned by the company that is not associated with the international operation of ships non section income  primarily from the air and ground transportation  hotel and tour business related to windstar cruises  is subject to income tax in the countries where such income is earned 
in the case of the united states  aicg has retained certain us affiliates of the company to conduct this business on its behalf and the non section income so earned  net of applicable deductions  is fully subject to us federal tax and applicable state and local taxes 
we believe that substantially all of windstar cruises income was derived from  or incidental to  the international operation of ships  and therefore all of such income qualifies for exemption from us federal income tax under section of the code 
we have reserved only for income taxes imposed by countries in which non section income is earned  including the united states 
pretax earnings of the windstar cruises  as earned in our foreign subsidiaries  are only subject to us taxation when effectively repatriated 
us income taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of the windstar cruises since we intend to reinvest  as opposed to repatriate  these earnings indefinitely 
it is not practical to determine the amount of undistributed earnings or income tax payable in the event we repatriate all undistributed foreign earnings 
however  if these earnings were distributed back to the company  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
we believe our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities may challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
for uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the greatest amount of 
table of contents tax benefit that has a greater than probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for uncertain income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties that would be assessed in relation to the settlement value of unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax provision

the decrease in revenue resulted primarily from decrease in revenue from our marine operations  cruise operations and insurance operations offset by an increase in revenue from our travel and events operations 
revenue from our marine operations decreased by million to million in due to lower volume of work in as compared to revenue from our cruise operations decreased by million to in primarily due to an increase of million from our windstar cruises brand offset by a decrease of million from our majestic america line brand 
revenue from our travel and events operations increased by million to million in due to the overall size of events operated during revenue from our insurance programs decreased by million 
table of contents due to a decrease in premiums earned on existing insurance programs as we have not entered into any new programs since june in  if we sell our non windstar cruises assets and businesses  our revenues are expected to decrease on an overall basis from the prior periods due to the decrease in reporting units 
within our windstar cruises operations  we expect to carry fewer passengers at lower average per diems apd 
apd represents average daily net ticket revenue total cruise ticket revenues plus non discountable amounts  less discounts  commissions and various other items our passengers pay for their respective cruises 
as of december   we had a backlog of million for marina projects under contract in  which we currently anticipate to be completed within our backlog represents an estimate of the remaining future gross revenue from existing signed contracts and contracts that have been awarded with a defined scope of work and contract value and on which we have begun work with verbal client approval 
we do not believe that our backlog is fully indicative of the amount of potential future revenue that we may achieve due to the short term nature of the contracts under which we generally provide our services compared to the long term nature of the projects  and since our backlog is dependent upon the completion of numerous individual projects that are subject to certain factors that can alter the ultimate timing  completion and amount of backlog recognition 
cruise operating expenses cruise operating expenses represents direct expenses incurred with owning and operating our cruise ships 
cruise operating expenses decreased million to million in in  due to a decrease in number of operating days and decease in number of passengers carried by the majestic america vessels as compared to the prior year  cruise operating expenses decreased but were offset by the increase in cruise operating expenses for windstar cruises due to a full year of operations of windstar cruises in compared to only nine months of operations in in  we experienced high costs for fuel  freight and logistics all of which negatively impacted our cruise operating expenses 
we expect cruise operating expenses related to windstar cruises to decrease in as a result of more normalized expenses related to fuel  freight and logistics 
cost of marine revenue cost of marine revenue decreased million to million in due to lower levels of marine revenues in compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of marine revenue  cost of marine revenue was in compared to in in future periods  we expect cost of marine revenue to fluctuate with the changes in marine revenue generated during the period 
selling and tour promotion selling and tour promotion expenses were million in  compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to significant reductions in promotion and marketing expenses for the majestic america brand in as compared to in we incurred a significant amount of promotion and marketing expenses to launch and establish the majestic america brand and to promote the full fleet of domestic ships that operated in in  upon our decision to scale back the majestic america operations  we stopped all promotional and advertising expenditures related to the majestic america brand resulting in a decrease of million 
this was offset by a million increase in promotional and advertising materials related to the windstar cruises brand as a result of full year operations in compared to nine months operations in we expect selling and tour promotion expenses to decrease in for the windstar cruises brand as a result of decreased promotion efforts necessary in the second full year of operations 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased in dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenue  to million and of total revenue in from million and of total revenue in the decrease is primarily due to reduction in the general and administrative expenses incurred by the cruise segment as a result of scaling back the majestic america operations and related administrative costs and corporate and other segments 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in dollar terms in as a result of the consolidation of our company into one segment and decrease in the number of individual operating units reported 
impairment loss we recorded an impairment loss of million due to the write down of the assets of our marine segment 
as a result of our determination that there is a more than likelihood that amg will be sold in the near term  we evaluated the ongoing value of amg s long lived assets and determined that they were impaired 
the carrying value of amg and amg s long lived assets including goodwill at december  was million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair value of amg was million 
fair value was based on indications of interest received early on in the company s sale process  which is still ongoing 
the entire carrying value of the long lived assets  including goodwill  was written down to zero 
the remaining excess carrying value of million after the write off of goodwill and intangible assets was allocated to property  plant and equipment  inventory  prepaid and other current assets and to accounts receivable 
as a result of the current global economic weakness and our announcement subsequent to the year ended december   that we plan to sell our non windstar assets including amg in the near term  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of fair value may change in the near term resulting in the need to adjust the recorded value 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase is related to the additional depreciation expense resulting from the acquisitions completed during and we expect depreciation expense to decrease in due to the disposal of some of the majestic america brand vessels in and the expected disposal of the remaining majestic america brand vessels in loss and loss adjustment expenses loss and loss adjustment expenses were million in compared to million in the change is related to changes in loss rates based on actuarial analyses 
we do not anticipate these costs to increase in as a result of us not entering into any new agreements in insurance acquisition costs and other operating expenses insurance acquisition costs and other operating expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is related to the decrease in net insurance premiums earned in compared to we do not anticipate these costs to increase in since we did not enter into any new agreements in operating income loss we reported an operating loss of million in compared to million in operating loss from our cruise segment decreased by million to million in from million in the operating loss in the majestic america line division was due to aggressive 
table of contents discounting to drive capacity  over reliance on our direct mail campaigns and increased cruise operating expenses 
operating loss from our marine segment was million in  primarily due to the impairment loss of million recorded in  compared to operating income of million in operating income from our travel and events segment increased by million to million in from million in the change in operating income is the result of changes described above 
other income expense in  we recorded other expense of million compared to million in other expense in consisted primarily of million in loss on disposal of the ship related assets of the majestic america line offset by million in insurance proceeds related to the empress of the north and queen of the west incidents in and  respectively  million in legal settlement related to the grounding of the empress of the north in march  and million in settlement of the dispute related to the purchase of windstar cruises 
other expense during included million of interest expense related to long term debt assumed in our cruise acquisitions consummated during and and interest expense on our convertible notes issued in april  offset by million of interest and dividend income 
other expense in consisted primarily of million of interest expense related to long term debt assumed in our cruise acquisitions consummated during and and interest expense on our convertible notes issued in april  offset by million of interest and dividend income 
income taxes we recorded income tax benefit of million for  compared to income tax expense of million for in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets commencing in the fourth quarter of through december  a significant factor in determining the requirement for the valuation allowance was our cumulative three year historical loss generated as of sfas no 
largely precludes us from taking into consideration future outlook or forecasted income due to our limited operating history in our domestic cruise business 
the establishment of a valuation allowance does not have any impact on cash  nor does such an allowance preclude us from utilizing loss carry forwards in the future 
net loss net loss was million in compared to million in as a result of changes described above 
liquidity and capital resources due to the current global downturn in the economy  specifically the decrease in vacationers discretionary spending and the direct impact this has on the reduction in cruise bookings  decrease in corporate spending on incentive programs and the tightening effect of the credit market on financing for construction projects  we will need additional sources of cash in the immediate future in order to fund operations in accordingly  in february  we announced our intention to sell our non windstar cruises related assets  including the operations of marine  travel and events  majestic america line and insurance 
we hired an investment banking firm who is actively marketing the non windstar cruise assets for immediate sale 
in addition to the sale of assets  we are also seeking additional financing sources and renegotiating existing debt obligations 
based on the terms of the asset sales or additional financing  if any  our stockholders may have additional dilution 
the amount of dilution could be attributed to the issuance of warrants or securities with other dilutive characteristics  such as anti dilution clauses or price resets 
although we are in discussions with potential buyers and other prospects for additional funds  we currently have no completed funding commitments or sale transactions 
if we are not able to sell our non 
table of contents windstar cruises assets  raise additional financing and or renegotiate existing debt obligations in order to raise funds for operations  we will be forced to extend payment terms with vendors where possible  and or to suspend or curtail certain of our planned operations and possibly seek protection in bankruptcy 
any of these actions would harm our business  results of operations and future prospects could cause our debt obligations to be accelerated and could result in potential damages on existing contracts within our marine and travel and events businesses 
as a result of our need for additional financing and other factors  the report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we cease to continue as a going concern  due to lack of available capital or otherwise  you may lose your entire investment in our company 
net cash provided by used in operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operations in compared to is due to the timing differences in the collection of current assets and the payment of current liabilities offset by the increase in net loss adjusted for non cash related charges incurred during the period 
net cash provided by used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities in was due to the cash received in the reduction of the restriction requirements and proceeds from sale of available for sale securities partially offset by purchases of property and equipment  consisting mainly of ship improvements conducted during lay up and drydock periods  and cash paid for the acquisition of windstar cruises 
these uses of cash were partially offset by sales of available for sale securities net of increases in invested restricted cash 
in  we will incur capital expenditures and costs for improvements to and maintenance of our ships 
in  planned capital expenditures and drydock projects are expected to be approximately million for amg and windstar cruises 
we do not have any material commitments of capital expenditures in our travel and events or insurance businesses in on january   we acquired american west 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired the membership interests of american west for  repaid debt of million and assumed million in fixed rate  debt payable through and guaranteed by us maritime administration marad 
in addition  the transaction consideration consisted of  shares of our restricted common stock  which was forfeited because the required financial targets were not met 
en boat  a subsidiary of the company and owner of the empress of the north  was unable to make its semi annual payment on the note due july  and was unable to cure the payment default within the day cure period 
on august   we returned the empress of the north to marad s custodial control following its last sailing on august  as a result of the disposal of the empress of the north  we wrote off million in assets primarily vessels and million in liabilities primarily loans payable and recorded a million gain on disposal for the year ended december  the default under the note will have a limited financial impact because recourse on the default is limited to the empress of the north 
on april   we acquired the cruise related assets of delta queen for million in cash  the assumption of million of passenger deposits and the assumption of million of fixed rate  debt payable through and guaranteed by the us maritime administration 
in addition  the transaction included contingent consideration of  shares of our common stock to be granted to delta queen if certain future financial targets were met in any of the three years following the close of the transaction 
aq boat  llc  a subsidiary of the company and owner of the american queen  was unable to make its semiannual principal payments on the note 
on november   we returned the american queen to marad s custodial control following its last sailing on november  under the trust indenture  we  as the ultimate parent of aq boat  llc  had guaranteed principal payments on the debt assumed by aq boat  llc and we were required to make principal payments on the debt or additional note amounting to million by february   in the event of default by aq boat  llc 
through november   aq boat  llc had paid million towards principal payments 
at december   we accrued the 
table of contents remaining guaranteed principal payment of million 
as a result of the disposal of the american queen  we wrote off million in assets primarily vessels and million in liabilities primarily loans payable and recorded a million loss on disposal for the year ended december  on february   we purchased certain assets related to the newport harbor shipyard for million
