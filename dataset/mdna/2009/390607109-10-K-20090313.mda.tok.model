item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview great lakes is the largest provider of dredging services in the united states 
in addition  we are the only us dredging contractor with significant international operations  which represented approximately of our dredging revenues for compared with our three year average of 
the mobility of our fleet enables us to move equipment in response to changes in demand for dredging services 
dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil  sand or rock 
the us dredging market consists of three primary types of work capital  beach nourishment and maintenance  in which sectors we have experienced an average combined bid market share in the us of over the past three years  including  and of the capital  beach nourishment and maintenance sectors  respectively 
the company s largest domestic dredging customer is the corps  which has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control 
in  the company s dredging revenues earned from contracts with federal government agencies  including the corps as well as other federal entities such as the us coast guard and us navy  was approximately  as compared with our three year average of 
the company also owns a majority interest in nasdi  a demolition service provider located in the boston  massachusetts area 
nasdi s principal services consist of interior and exterior demolition of commercial and industrial buildings  salvage and recycling of related materials  and removal of hazardous substances and materials 
the company operates in two reportable segments dredging and demolition 
the company has a ownership interest in amboy aggregates amboy 
amboy s primary business is mining sand from the entrance channel to the new york harbor in order to provide sand and aggregate for use in road and building construction 
the company and its amboy joint venture partner own a interest in land that is adjacent to amboy s property and may be used in conjunction with amboy s operations 
the company s investment in amboy is accounted for using the equity method 
contract revenues most of the company s dredging contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid 
the nature of the specified services dictates the type of equipment  material and labor involved  all of which affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid 
the company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  based on the company s engineering estimates of the physical percentage completed for dredging projects and using a cost to cost approach for demolition projects 
for dredging projects  costs of contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the gross profit percentage expected to be achieved upon ultimate completion of each dredging project 
for demolition projects  contract revenues are adjusted to reflect the estimated gross profit percentage 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation due the company are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
billings on contracts are generally submitted after verification with the customers of physical progress and may not match the timing of revenue recognition 
the difference between amounts billed and recognized as revenue is 
table of contents reflected in the balance sheet as either contract revenues in excess of billings or billings in excess of contract revenues 
contract modifications may be negotiated when a change from the original contract specifications is encountered  necessitating a change in project scope or performance methodology and or material disposal 
significant expenditures incurred incidental to major contracts are deferred and recognized as costs of contracts based on contract performance over the duration of the related project 
these expenditures are reported as prepaid expenses 
costs and expenses the components of costs of contract revenues include labor  equipment including depreciation  lease expense  insurance  fuel  maintenance and supplies  subcontracts  rentals  and project overhead 
hourly labor is generally hired on a project by project basis 
costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized 
generally  capital projects have the highest margins due to the complexity of the projects  while beach nourishment projects have the most volatile margins because they are most often exposed to weather conditions 
the company s cost structure includes significant annual equipment related costs  including depreciation  maintenance  insurance and long term equipment rentals  these costs have averaged approximately to of total costs of contract revenues over the last three years 
during the year  both equipment utilization and the timing of fixed cost expenditures fluctuate significantly 
accordingly  the company allocates these fixed equipment costs to interim periods in proportion to revenues recognized over the year  to better match revenues and expenses 
specifically  at each interim reporting date the company compares actual revenues earned to date on its dredging contracts to expected annual revenues and recognizes equipment costs on the same proportionate basis 
in the fourth quarter  any over and under allocated equipment costs are recognized such that the expense for the year equals actual equipment costs incurred during the year 
as a result of this methodology  the recorded expense in any interim period may be higher or lower than the actual equipment costs incurred in that interim period 
utilization current and projected utilization of equipment is a factor the company considers important in managing its dredging business 
the company does not measure utilization of equipment in the aggregate  however  it tracks utilization by dredge and other major pieces of equipment 
the ability to maintain high levels of equipment utilization impacts the company s profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that can affect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company  as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
percentage of completion method of revenue recognition the company s contract revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method  which is by its nature based on an estimation process 
for dredging projects  the company uses engineering estimates of the physical percentage of completion 
for demolition projects  the company uses estimates of remaining costs to complete to determine project percent complete 
in preparing its estimates  the company draws on its extensive experience in the dredging and demolition businesses and its proprietary database of historical information to help assure that its estimates are as accurate as possible  given current circumstances 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
claims for additional compensation are not recognized in contract revenues until such claims are settled 
cost and profit estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis to reflect changes in expected project performance 

table of contents impairment of goodwill statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
great lakes believes that this estimate is a critical accounting estimate because i goodwill is a material asset and ii the impact of an impairment could be material to the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of july each year 
the company assesses the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth trends  forecasted revenues and expenses  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
the estimates are based on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and may result in the impairment of goodwill in the event that actual future results differ from those estimates 
at december   the majority of goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed by madison dearborn capital partners iv  lp on december  goodwill was allocated between the company s two reporting segments  dredging and demolition  based on the value assigned to each segment at that time 
at december  and  dredging goodwill was million in each year and demolition goodwill was million and million  respectively 
the increase in demolition goodwill was the result of the april  acquisition by the company of the interest in nasdi it did not previously own 
see note minority interest acquisition to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill was tested for impairment during the third quarter of at which time it was concluded that the fair value of each reporting segment was in excess of its carrying value 
as a result of the downturn in the us and global economies  the company s share price and market capitalization decreased in the fourth quarter  and as a result management considered whether there were any indicators that the company s goodwill was impaired 
the company concluded that no indicators of impairment were present and therefore no additional impairment test was required 
the company s conclusion was based on its review of its market capitalization as of december  plus a reasonable control premium  when compared to the company s carrying value of its invested capital and the strong performance of the company s dredging operations during the third and fourth quarters of subsequent to december   the company s stock price declined below its book value per share 
if the company s stock price remains less than the book value per share going forward it will assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value pursuant to sfas no 
which may result in a requirement to evaluate goodwill for impairment 
the company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis  and between annual tests if events or conditions result in a triggering event  thus requiring a test 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
the company s policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an asset s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value 
the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset s book value and fair market value 
the company s policy is to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows using financial projections that require the exercise of significant judgment on the part of management 
changes in these projections may expose the company to future impairment charges 
if a triggering event requiring impairment testing occurs  the company would evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether the lives are still appropriate 
self insurance reserves the company maintains various insurance policies  including  hull and machinery  general liability and personal injury 
we partially self insure risks covered by our policies 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that the company will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
in determining its estimates  the company incorporates historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in determination of such reserves 
income taxes the company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
the company s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
management believes it has adequately provided for uncertain tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
however  the company s future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire

however  these estimates are necessarily subject to fluctuations based on the amount and type of material that actually must be dredged 
because of these factors  as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenues or profitability 
in addition  a significant portion of our dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts  which can be canceled at any time without penalty  subject to our right  generally  to recover our actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
our backlog includes only those projects for which the customer has provided an executed contract dredging

maintenance backlog was million at the end of  nearly three times backlog of million at the end of as noted above  the maintenance bid market was million  which was above the five year average maintenance market of million  primarily due to emergency funding the corps received after spring flooding in the mississippi and hurricanes in the gulf 
the company s share of the market was  on par with its historical share of over the last three years 
foreign capital backlog increased to million at the end of from million at the end of  primarily as a result of signing the second phase of the diyar land reclamation project in september however  as a consequence of the economic uncertainty in the middle east  in february  the company was asked to enter into discussions to restructure the second phase of this project to allow the customer flexibility on the timing of project funding 
the company is working with the customer to devise a mutually beneficial arrangement
