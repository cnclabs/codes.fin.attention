further  this section includes forward looking statements which should be read in conjunction with the section entitled item a risk factors 
overview during fiscal  the pervasive and severe world wide economic downturn had a material impact on our industry and business 
we saw our net sales decrease  or as our customers struggled with lower demand for their products and reducing inventory overhangs 
we experienced significant declines in sales to our nafta truck customers during fiscal  decreasing approximately from the prior year 
sales to european and asian customers were down even more dramatically by and  respectively 
gross margin dollars declined during fiscal due to the lower sales volumes and gross margin percentages declined primarily because overhead costs did not decline as rapidly as sales volumes  even though certain expense such as materials and labor generally fluctuated with sales volumes 
sales prices for our products and component purchases remained relatively constant during the year 
although the future remains unclear  based on comments in the popular press and available industry forecast data  it appears possible this industry downturn may continue for some time into the future 
in response to this significant negative shift in the world wide economic situation and demand for our products  during fiscal we reduced operational costs at an annualized rate of approximately  in fiscal  our cash position has increased over the prior year primarily through cost management efforts and reductions in inventory to balance inventory levels with sales volumes 
we have not reduced our commitment to or spending on new product development and technology for existing and new customers 
although no assurances can be given  management believes that it is likely that our  in cash will be adequate to sustain the company through this continuing economic downturn 
as we move forward into fiscal and beyond  we will continue to work closely with our existing and potential customers to design and develop new products and adapt existing products to new applications  and to improve the performance  reliability and cost effectiveness of our products

during fiscal  we have seen a significant reduction in the number of units of trucks  busses and off road vehicles built world wide due to the significant recessionary pressures in the united states and many parts of the rest of the world 
all of our large truck oem customers have reduced build rates  and many have taken extensive down time in it is uncertain how protracted the current economic downturn in both the general economy and the truck and off road markets will be world wide and the impact it will have on us for fiscal and beyond although we do not anticipate volumes returning to pre fiscal levels in fiscal in the north american market  sales to heavy truck customers were down compared to fiscal  which is the direct result of the overall reduction in truck build rates in north america 
our share of that market and unit pricing remained essentially unchanged from the prior year 
the sales declines to our european truck customers were even more dramatic  decreasing over the prior year 
on a year over year basis  sales to asia decreased 
net sales to off road customers decreased as that market also experienced reduced production rates in response to the lower levels of construction activity world wide 
we expect that electronic throttle control sales generally will continue to vary directly with future changes in the economy in general and the economic climate affecting new purchases of heavy trucks  transit buses and off road vehicles in particular 
these variations are largely dependent upon  and are expected to vary directly with  production volumes in the various geographic markets in which we serve 
additionally  competitive pricing may reduce margins and gross sales 
net sales decreased  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to an overall decrease in the build rates of heavy trucks in the north american market 
sales to nafta truck customers declined when compared to the same period in fiscal due primarily to timing of truck sales in the united states resulting from changes in emission standards for truck engines 
the company s share of this market and unit pricing remained essentially unchanged from the prior year 
sales to our asian and european truck customers increased approximately and  respectively  compared to the twelve months ended september  world wide sales in the off road market declined approximately 
the increases in sales to asian and european truck customers helped to offset a portion of the decline from the north american truck market and world wide off road market 
percent change to to for the year ended september gross profit    gross profit was  or  of net sales for the year ended september   a decrease of  from the gross profit of  or  of net sales in the comparable fiscal period 
the gross profit decline in fiscal is primarily driven by the net decrease in sales of electronic throttle control systems to our heavy truck  transit bus and off road customers 
our business is not entirely scalable  which means that certain overhead costs will not vary directly in proportion to sales volumes  particularly during periods of declining sales revenues 
however  direct production costs such as materials and labor generally fluctuate with sales volumes 
additionally  gross profit was negatively impacted in fiscal due to settlement of outstanding labor issues and severance costs totaling approximately  recording a write down to the value of our remaining capitalized license fee related to adjustable pedal technology of due to the significant decline in business in the recreational vehicle industry  and an overall increase in warranty costs 
offsetting some of these increases in costs were overall reductions in salary cost related to our cost reduction program in fiscal gross profit was  or  of net sales for the year ended september   a decrease of from the gross profit of  or  of net sales in the comparable fiscal period 
the decrease in gross profit in fiscal is primarily driven by the net decrease in sales of electronic throttle control systems to north american heavy truck customers offset in part by higher european and asian sales volumes 
beginning in late fiscal  we began to see a decline in the order rates from some of our principal truck oem s due to recessionary pressures in the united states and other portions of the world 
during fiscal  we substantially completed our realignment of operations  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and as a result of this realignment we experienced an overall reduction in labor costs and net material costs due to continued efforts in global sourcing and the production of our own internally developed contacting and non contacting sensors 
overhead expenses decreased between periods  but increased slightly as a percentage of sales 
percent change to to for the year ended september research and development    research and development expenses were essentially unchanged when compared to the year ended september  the company s research and development expenditures generally will fluctuate based on the programs and products under development at any given point in time  and that fluctuation often does not coincide with sales cycles 
although our sales are down  our cash flows have been negatively impacted and we instituted temporary company wide salary reductions in fiscal  we feel it remains important that we continue our commitment to and spending for new product development and technology for existing and new customers and programs 
overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase to more normalized levels once the temporary cost reductions are eliminated 
research and development expenses increased for the year ended september  compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in research and development expense is primarily attributable to operating our conceptual development center  which was completed in mid fiscal percent change to to for the year ended september selling    selling expenses decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the same period in fiscal mainly due to lower overall travel expenses  reduction in salary costs as a result of our cost reduction program and reductions in sales commission expenses as a result of lower commission sales 
selling expenses increased in fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in selling expenses is mainly due to higher overall salaries and expanded selling and marketing efforts  including expenses associated with sales and marketing related travel in the european  russian  chinese  south american and australian markets and increased emphasis in off road markets world wide 
percent change to to for the year ended september administration    administration expenses for the year ended september  were essentially unchanged when compared to the same period in fiscal increases in administration expenses include a non cash compensation expense recognized in conjunction with our unfunded deferred compensation plan during fiscal and an overall increase in bad debt expense of as the economic downturn progressed during fiscal  we have experienced more past due accounts and collection difficulties with certain customers and accordingly have increased our collection efforts and bad debt reserves 
off setting some of these increases in administration expenses were reductions in salary costs and director fees resulting from implementing certain cost cutting measures during fiscal  including temporary company wide salary reductions and a reduction in fees paid to the members of the company s board of directors 
in addition  audit fees related to our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act decreased 
at september   we are not required to be audited under the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act due to our public float decreasing below the required level for an audit  however we have maintained all of our internally generated internal control measures 
this change resulted in a corresponding decrease in audit fees related to such services 
currently all companies will be required to comply with sarbanes oxley beginning with fiscal years ending on or after june  and based on those current regulations  we anticipate that our public accountants will again be required to audit our system of internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal administration expenses for the year ended september  decreased as compared to the same period in fiscal the decrease in administration expenses is primarily due to a reduction in legal fees  including those associated with the class action lawsuit  which is also discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
overall  legal fees decreased approximately 
administration expense increased for design changes to our compensation structure  employee recruitment and relocation costs 
included in administration expenses for the year ended september  was the recording of an additional of environmental liability as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
percent change to to for the year ended september gain from settlement of environmental claims  nm nm as part of our contractual indemnity claim against dana and contribution claims against blount and rosan  as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  during fiscal we received cash payments totaling from dana  blount and rosan and shares in dana equal to approximately at the time of settlement 
as of september   we recorded a gain of  in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
percent change to to for the year ended september realignment of operations nm nm we recorded expenses of for the year ended september  related to our realignment of operations as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as the realignment was complete in fiscal  no realignment expense was recorded in fiscal years and percent change to to for the year ended september interest income interest expense interest expense has continued to decrease over the last three years due to the decrease in overall borrowing 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased compared to the same period in fiscal and in fiscal was lower than fiscal as of september   all of our debt has been fully paid off and we have cancelled our revolving loan facility with ge capital 
percent change to to for the year ended september loss on impairment of investments nm nm loss on impairment of investments is a non cash  other than temporary impairment charge relating to common stock of dana during the first quarter of fiscal the impairment charge assumes no income tax benefit given the uncertainty of the company s ability to generate future taxable investment gains required to utilize these investment losses 
prior to recording the impairment charge  the decline in market value was carried net of tax in other comprehensive loss 
following the recording of this impairment charge  all subsequent changes in market value of our short term investments is recorded net of tax in other comprehensive income loss 
percent change to to for the year ended september other income expense  net  nm nm other expense of in fiscal primarily consisted of losses related to the disposal of certain fixed assets 
other income of in fiscal consisted primarily of a gain related to the sales and disposal of certain fixed assets and foreign currency gains 
other income was  in fiscal and consisted primarily of a gain from the extinguishment of old outstanding accounts payable balances of various insolvent subsidiaries as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and a gain from the extinguishment of old and disputed outstanding accounts payable balances related to an active subsidiary 
also included in other income in fiscal is a gain related to the sales and disposal of certain fixed assets 
percent change to to for the year ended september income tax expense benefit    in fiscal  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the overall tax rate was in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the mix of pretax earnings losses between domestic and foreign jurisdictions  primarily in china 
the mix of earnings combined with lower tax rates in our foreign jurisdictions caused the tax rate to exceed prior year levels 
additionally  a favorable r d credit adjustment was recorded due to a change in united states tax law and the initial recording of our chinese deferred tax assets during fiscal which combined to increase the tax rate by 
this increase was partially offset by a valuation allowance against an unrealized investment loss and an unfavorable domestic production activities deduction adjustment related to the federal net operating loss carry back 
the decrease in tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in the united states domestic production activities deduction and a larger percentage of the company s earnings being taxed at the lower chinese tax rate 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of changes in our overall tax rate 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at september   we had on hand cash and cash equivalents of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we cancelled our revolving loan facility with ge capital  which as of the day of termination had a zero balance 
we believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs on a short term and longer term basis without the necessity of borrowing  or attempting to borrow from a revolving credit facility 
however  were we to require additional borrowing capacity  we may be unable to locate such capacity on acceptable terms or at all 
cash generated from operations was  for the year ended september   a decrease of  from the cash generated from operations of  for the year ended september  net income loss plus non cash charges for depreciation and stock based compensation contributed cash of in fiscal and contributed cash of  for the year ended september  the decline in profitability due to the reduced sales volumes was the primary factor in the reduced cash generated by operating activities 
changes in working capital items generated cash of  for the year ended september  compared to a use of cash in the corresponding prior year period 
timing of collections on receivables and lower sales levels resulted in lower receivables  which increased cash by  during fiscal  compared to a use of cash of  in the prior year period 
inventories were reduced by  for the year ended september  compared to in fiscal to match inventory volumes with lower sales volumes in fiscal accounts payable decreased in fiscal  primarily due to the lower sales and inventory purchases 
cash flows from operations for the years ended september  and included payments to fund our pension plans of and  respectively 
although we have made reductions to our cost structure during fiscal in response to our lower sales volumes  due to the uncertain world wide economic market and product demand from our customers we may experience periods of negative cash flow from operations 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended september  and  for the year ended september  and was comprised primarily of purchases of equipment for both periods 
we expect our cash use for investing activities to at least remain constant and potentially increase in the future as we continue to purchase capital equipment to expand and support our operations worldwide 
we currently anticipate spending approximately  in capital expenditures for the year ended september  cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended september   compared to cash used in financing activities of for the year ended september  in october  we announced a share repurchase plan whereby the company can  but is under no obligation  to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases may be made in the open market or through bock trades  in compliance with securities and exchange commission guidelines  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
in fiscal  we purchased  shares of common stock at a total value of  which comprises all of the cash usage for financing activities for the year 
the use of cash for financing activities for fiscal primarily relates to debt payments of  slightly offset by cash proceeds of from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations as of september  at september   our contractual obligations consisted of operating lease obligations and a license agreement 
we do not have any letters of credit or debt guarantees outstanding at september  maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period less than total year years years operating leases   mmt license minimum royalties certain liabilities  including those related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans  are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of stated maturities 
we have net obligations at september  related to our pension plans and post retirement medical plan of  and  respectively 
we funded to our pension plans in fiscal and we expect to make payments of in fiscal to fund our pension plans 
a debtor can only relieve itself of a liability if it has been extinguished and accordingly  a liability is considered extinguished if a the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or b the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability  either judicially or by the creditor 
during the year ended september   the company was judicially released from and reversed of old accounts payable resulting in a gain  which has been recorded in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
no amounts were released and reversed during fiscal and the company expects to reverse amounts in future periods based on the recognition of the liabilities being judicially released of in fiscal  and a total of in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment  which is when title and risk of loss transfers to customers  and when all of the following have occurred a firm sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are reported net of estimated returns  rebates and customer discounts 
discounts and rebates are recorded during the period they are earned by the customer 
product warranty we provide a warranty covering defects arising from products sold 
the product warranty liability is based on historical return rates of products and amounts for significant and specific warranty issues 
the warranty is limited to a specified time period  mileage or hours of use  and varies by product  application and customer 
the company has recorded a warranty liability which  in the opinion of management  is adequate to cover such costs 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  they are subject to change and such change could be material 
legal we are involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings from time to time 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
in connection with such claims and lawsuits  we estimate the probability of losses based on advice of legal counsel  the outcomes of similar litigation  legislative development and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
we expense legal expenses related to claims in the period incurred 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
environmental costs we estimate the costs of investigation and remediation for certain soil and groundwater contaminants at our portland  oregon facility 
the ultimate costs to the company for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of this site cannot be predicted with certainty due to the often unknown magnitude of the pollution or the necessary cleanup  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods  the amount of time necessary to accomplish such cleanups and the evolving nature of cleanup technologies and governmental regulations 
the company has recognized a liability for environmental remediation costs for this site in an amount that management believes is probable and reasonably estimable 
when the estimate of a probable loss is within a range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued when no estimate within the range is better than another 
in making these judgments and assumptions  the company considers  among other things  the activity to date at the site and information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors 
the company regularly monitors its exposure to environmental loss contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimated liability accrual will occur in the near future 
pensions and post retirement benefit obligations pension and post retirement benefit obligations and net period benefit cost are calculated using actuarial models 
the most important assumptions that affect these computations are the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated at least annually and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
to determine our discount rate  we discounted the expected benefit payments using the citigroup pension liability index yield curve 
the equivalent level interest rate that produces the same present value of benefits was then determined 
our assumed rate does not differ significantly from this benchmark rate 
we assumed a discount rate of to determine our pension benefit obligations at september  and a rate of to determine our net periodic benefit cost in fiscal a decrease in these discount rates would have increased our pension benefit obligations at the end of fiscal by  and increased our net periodic benefit cost in by a increase in discount rates would have decreased our pension obligations at september  by  and decreased our net periodic benefit cost in by to determine the discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan  we also discounted the expected benefit payments using the citigroup pension liability index yield curve and assumed a discount rate of to determine our post retirement benefit obligations at september  and a rate of to determine our post retirement benefit cots in fiscal a decrease in discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased our post retirement benefit expense in by a increase in discount rate would have decreased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and decreased our post retirement benefit expense in by to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current asset allocations and the historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets obtained from our investment portfolio manager 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have impacted net periodic benefit cost in fiscal by our post retirement plan does not contain any plan assets 
we assumed healthcare cost trend rates for our post retirement plan of in  decreasing gradually to in and remaining at thereafter 
a increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased post retirement benefit expense in by a decrease in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have decreased the post retirement benefit obligation by at the end of fiscal and decreased post retirement benefit expense in by share based compensation expense we measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards  and awards we grant  modify  repurchase or cancel in the future  at fair value and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when calculating fair value including estimated stock price volatility  expected term and expected forfeitures 
factors considered in estimating forfeitures include the types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
income taxes for each jurisdiction that we operate in  we are required to estimate our annual effective tax rate together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and unless we believe that recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
our income tax provision on the consolidated statement of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
this process is complex and involves significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to require employers to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post retirement plan 
these disclosures should principally include information detailing investment policies and strategies  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets and an understanding of significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
this guidance will be effective for the company beginning in fiscal october  
upon initial application  this guidance is not required to be applied to earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes 
the company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to affirm that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this guidance defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
among other requirements  this guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values  with limited exceptions  acquisition related costs generally will be expensed as incurred 
this guidance requires certain financial statement disclosures to enable users to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this guidance must be applied prospectively to business combinations that are consummated on or after october  accordingly  the company will record and disclose business combinations under the revised standard for transactions consummated  if any  on or after october  in addition  adjustments of certain income tax balances related to acquired deferred assets  including those acquired prior to the adoption of this new authoritative guidance  shall be reported as an increase or decrease to income tax expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments 
the company s primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate risk the company had a revolving loan agreement with its primary lender ge capital  which originally expired on september   however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company cancelled this revolving loan agreement 
as of september   there was no balance outstanding on any loan or revolving loan agreements 
foreign currency risk we sell our products to customers in the heavy truck  transit bus and off road equipment industries 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  the company had foreign sales of approximately and of net sales  respectively 
all worldwide sales in fiscal and  with the exception of  and  respectively  were denominated in us dollars 
during fiscal  we established a manufacturing facility in suzhou  china and we opened sales offices in shanghai  china and munich  germany 
we purchase components internationally for use in both our products whose sales are denominated in us dollars and other currencies 
although the company is expanding its international exposure  it does not believe that changes in future exchange rates would have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows at this time 
as a result  the company has not entered into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions to hedge against foreign currency risk 
the company will continue to assess its foreign currency risk as its international operations  international purchases and sales increase 
investment risk the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
the company s cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are short term in nature  and  thus  the company believes they are not exposed to material investment risk
