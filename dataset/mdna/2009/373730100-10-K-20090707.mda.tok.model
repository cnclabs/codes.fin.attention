overview and outlook through its global operations  gerber develops  manufactures  distributes and services integrated automation equipment and software  as well as related aftermarket supplies  for the sign making and specialty graphics industry  the apparel and flexible materials industry and the ophthalmic lens processing industry 
gerber s three reportable business segments consist of the following sign making and specialty graphics gerber scientific products and spandex business units  apparel and flexible materials gerber technology  and ophthalmic lens processing gerber coburn 
gerber s sales strategy emphasizes new product development and expansion into new geographic markets 
gerber s product development process focuses on platform development that enables the company to leverage its product innovations with product extensions and add ons 
gerber s long term growth strategy features geographic expansion in asian markets  particularly in china  and the addition of markets throughout europe 
gerber pursues a number of initiatives intended to improve its operating efficiency and gross profit margins 
the focus of this effort is the implementation of lean manufacturing principles aimed at increasing gerber s profit margins  including strengthening manufacturing policies and procedures  consolidating and improving supplier relationships  improving inventory methods and reducing inventory  seeking low cost sourcing opportunities for key parts and components used in the company s newer products  and increasing the company s offerings of higher margin value added products  especially within aftermarket supplies 
gerber believes that the foregoing strategies will position gerber for resumption in growth when gerber s markets recover 
despite the current economic downturn  gerber completed several initiatives in fiscal to promote future growth 
late in fiscal and early in fiscal  gerber launched several key new products  including the solara ion uv inkjet printers  the dtl generator and maat polisher  which together form the basis for the advanced lens processing system with free form capability  and the z gerbercutter  the first in the new z series of premium line of multi ply cutting systems 
key new products  driven by sales of the solara ion  generated million in revenue during fiscal compared with new product revenue of million in fiscal gerber believes that the impact of the weak global economy and adverse credit markets that reduced credit availability for potential customers negatively impacted these product launches in fiscal as part of gerber s strategic process  management continually reviews its operating segments and selected markets in terms of their potential long term returns 
management periodically reviews and negotiates potential business acquisitions and divestitures  some of which may be material 
decisions regarding bolt on acquisitions generally focus on candidates that will contribute to the growth of gerber s core businesses  increase earnings per share  and generate positive cash flow in the first year of acquisition 
gerber may also consider business divestitures if management determines that the applicable business no longer meets gerber s long term strategic objectives or that the divestiture could increase cash flows 
gerber completed two key acquisitions in fiscal in september  gerber acquired gamma computer tech co  ltd 
in china for a purchase price of approximately million 
gamma  a manufacturer of equipment for the apparel and flexible materials markets  is expected to expand gerber s operations in this segment in china 
in october  gerber acquired virtek vision international  inc for a purchase price of approximately million 
virtek  a manufacturer of precision laser based templating  inspection  marking and engraving solutions  expands gerber technology s footprint in the composite materials manufacturing value chain by extending its capabilities to provide an integrated solution in industrial applications 
together  these acquisitions generated revenue of approximately million in fiscal while new products and acquisitions had a positive impact on fiscal sales results  the weak global economy  which was believed to have caused uncertainty and reduced end market visibility for customers  combined with reduced availability of credit for equipment purchases and the negative impact on international sales of a strengthening united states dollar  more than offset the positive benefits 
the table below presents revenue by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years 
the decline across each segment in fiscal illustrates the impact of the weak global economy upon gerber s business 
for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands sign making and specialty graphics apparel and flexible materials ophthalmic lens processing revenue to moderate the impact of the worsening economic downturn  gerber initiated several actions  including workforce reductions  in fiscal to control its operating costs 
gerber continues to focus on controlling costs and is managing all aspects of its business to mitigate the effects of the current adverse economic environment 
the following table presents the components of operating income as a percentage of consolidated revenue 
for the fiscal years ended april  gross profit margin selling  general and administrative sg a expenses research and development operating income the fiscal decline in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to overall lower sales volume  a lower sales contribution from gerber s higher margin software business and severance costs 
fiscal gross profit margin benefited from million of patent license income 
to help mitigate the impacts of lower sales volume during fiscal  gerber focused on reducing its cost structure by several actions  including workforce reductions  facility rationalization plans and discretionary spending control 
the full benefit of the workforce reductions will be realized in fiscal  as the mid year timing of the actions and severance costs of million partially offset the full benefit in fiscal gerber also implemented a ten percent salary reduction in the united states during the last two months of fiscal that continued into fiscal  as well as certain furlough actions in the united states 
gerber expects to realize million in savings as a result of the fiscal workforce reduction actions in fiscal facility rationalization plans during fiscal resulted in a non cash benefit of million to sg a expenses as a result of management s decision to utilize a leased facility that was vacant  eliminating the need for a previously established restructuring accrual 
effective april   gerber froze its pension plan benefits  which eliminated future benefit accruals for participants in gerber s united states defined benefit pension plans 
gerber expects that this action  coupled with the impact of fiscal pension assumptions  should result in a reduction of approximately million of pension plan expenses in fiscal net income in fiscal was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of million from the merger of two french subsidiaries and million of a pre tax gain from the sale of its australian facility  and was adversely impacted by million of pre tax impairment charges related to an investment deemed other than temporarily impaired 
net income in fiscal included the benefit of non recurring pre tax gains of million related to the sale of a land parcel and the sale of the ophthalmic lens processing segment s innovations software 
fiscal results included a realized gain of million related to the sale of certain investments 
economic conditions can significantly impact gerber s businesses  as experienced during fiscal  and these challenging conditions have continued to date into fiscal delays in customer orders and overall weaker demand due to the global recession and depressed credit markets present a significant challenge in forecasting customer purchase patterns and  as a result  gerber s performance 
gerber believes that the significant efforts to stimulate the global economy will have a beneficial impact in the second half of fiscal although global economic uncertainty continues  gerber believes that the strength of its product portfolio  diversified business model and streamlined organizational structure should allow gerber to resume growth quickly when its markets begin to recover 
until this economic recovery occurs  gerber will continue to manage all aspects of its business with a heightened focus on cash generation 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development operating income revenue consolidated revenue for fiscal decreased by million  or percent  from fiscal levels 
as a significant portion of gerber s revenue base is international  fluctuations in foreign currency rates can have a significant impact on revenue 
unfavorable foreign currency translations negatively impacted fiscal revenue by approximately million as a result of the united states dollar strengthening against several other currencies in which gerber transacts business as compared with fiscal lower sales volume negatively impacted revenue by approximately million and was partially offset by the benefit of million from the two acquisitions completed in fiscal and favorable pricing of million 
gerber believes that the company has not lost market share in its various markets and that weak economic conditions account for most of the volume decline in gerber s fiscal revenue 
fiscal revenue increased million  or percent  compared with fiscal the increase included favorable foreign currency translation of million compared with fiscal and million of revenue contribution from the acquisition of data technology 
the table below presents revenue by source for the fiscal years ended april   and for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands equipment and software revenue aftermarket supplies revenue service revenue revenue equipment and software revenue declined percent in fiscal compared with fiscal gerber believes the lower equipment orders and revenue in fiscal were indicative of customer delays in making capital expenditures caused by the weak economy and the lack of credit availability to finance new equipment purchases  as well as unfavorable foreign currency translation as compared with fiscal gerber launched several key new products in late fiscal and fiscal  which contributed million of incremental revenue in fiscal while numerous new equipment products and enhancements were launched in fiscal  the most significant contributors to fiscal sales performance included the solara ion  a wide format ultraviolet inkjet printer  the z gerbercutter  a high performance multi ply cutting system and the dtl generator and maat polisher  which together form the basis for the advanced lens processing system with free form capability 
gerber believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on demand when the economies in its various markets recover 
aftermarket supplies revenue decreased percent from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales volume at gerber s end user customer locations within the sign making and specialty graphics segment and unfavorable foreign currency translation compared with fiscal typically  aftermarket supplies sales of replacement parts and consumables remain relatively stable due to the large base of installed equipment in use  even during turbulent economic conditions 
service revenue decreased percent from fiscal to fiscal the increased equipment installed base and related service contracts over the past few fiscal years partially mitigated the full economic impact on fiscal service revenue 
similar to aftermarket sales  service revenue typically remains relatively stable due to the large base of installed equipment 
the following table presents segment revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue in fiscal  and for the fiscal years ended april  sign making and specialty graphics apparel and flexible materials ophthalmic lens processing the increased contribution from the sign making and specialty graphics segment primarily reflected results of the spandex business unit  whose operations within europe were not adversely affected by the worsening economic conditions until mid fiscal revenue by geographic region and as a percentage of consolidated revenue in fiscal  and was as follows for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands north america europe rest of world revenue the increase in revenue contributed from north america in fiscal primarily reflected incremental revenue from the virtek acquisition 
this contribution was partially offset by weak demand from north america sign making and specialty graphics distributors and ophthalmic markets 
the reduced ophthalmic market demand reflected  in addition to weakened global economic conditions  the impact of continued larger laboratories industry consolidation efforts 
the fiscal decline in revenue contributed from europe reflected lower demand as a result of global economic factors  particularly in the second half of fiscal and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation 
the decline in rest of world revenue was primarily related to lower equipment and software demand from apparel markets within asia 
gerber reported revenue from china of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
gerber believes that the revenue decline in fiscal was attributable to the weak global economy and was not indicative of a fundamental change in the demand for its products 
as an international company  gerber s operating results are affected by global  industrial and political factors 
global geographic sales expansion and industry diversification  both of which are key gerber operating strategies  help to limit the adverse impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on gerber s consolidated revenue and operating results 
in fiscal  gerber expects to continue to focus both on its domestic and international operations by promoting new product launches worldwide and conducting business in targeted markets  particularly in the rest of world region 
gross profit gross profit for the past three fiscal years is shown in the following table for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands gross profit gross profit margin fiscal gross profit decreased percent compared with fiscal directly as a result of the percent decline in revenue 
additionally  the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translations lowered gross profit by million  or percent  compared with fiscal gross profit for fiscal was also impacted by million of severance costs incurred to implement workforce reductions 
incremental gross profit from fiscal acquisitions and cost savings measures  including workforce reductions and manufacturing shut downs  partially mitigated these declines 
gross profit in fiscal compared with fiscal was positively impacted by favorable foreign currency translations  increased sales volume  including patent licensing income and a fiscal acquisition 
gerber s gross profit margin has declined percentage points over the past two fiscal years due principally to the negative impact of lower revenue on the fixed cost base and a higher revenue contribution from the spandex distribution business  which realizes lower gross margins than gerber s manufacturing businesses 
compared to fiscal  fiscal results reported lower software sales and revenue from licensing patents  both of which types of revenue typically carry a higher gross profit margin 
in response to the fiscal revenue decline  gerber actively managed its fixed costs through workforce reductions 
gerber also continued to focus on continuous improvement initiatives through the implementation of lean manufacturing principles 
other initiatives pursued by gerber to improve its profit margins include increasing the breadth and quality of product offerings  strengthening manufacturing policies and procedures and continuing to investigate low cost sourcing opportunities for key parts and components used in its newer products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change selling  general and administrative expenses the significant decline in sg a expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was principally attributable to fiscal workforce reductions 
the reduction in sg a expenses also reflected reutilization of a previously vacated leased facility  which generated a non cash expense reduction of million from the reversal of a previously established restructuring reserve  a heightened focus on controlling all discretionary spending  the absence of an incentive compensation expense since performance objectives were not met  and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately million compared with fiscal sg a expenses also benefited from lower selling expenses in fiscal attributable to lower sales volume and from a million gain on the sale of property within the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
the full benefit of these items in fiscal was moderated by incremental sg a expenses of million from the recent acquisitions  higher net bad debt expense of million from general economic conditions  higher defined benefit plan expenses of million  higher medical and other self insurance costs of million  and incremental severance costs of million 
the higher defined benefit plan expenses included a million curtailment loss recognized as a result of the freeze of future benefits 
sg a expenses in fiscal included incentive compensation expense of million  million in professional fees related to gerber s adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations of approximately million as compared with fiscal  and the benefit from a gain of million on the sale of assets within the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
in comparison to fiscal  fiscal sg a expenses also reflected higher commissions  sales and marketing costs for strategic investments related to new products  and incremental costs from geographic expansion  higher severance costs of million  lower incentive compensation expense of million  lower self insurance costs of million  and lower pension costs of million 
the lower incentive compensation expense primarily resulted from incentive compensation plan design changes adopted at the beginning of fiscal lower pension costs were primarily related to employee demographic changes 
sg a expenses are expected to benefit in fiscal from actions initiated in fiscal  including the reduction in workforce and the implementation of the pension plans freeze effective on april  research and development for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands change change research and development expenses r d gerber has a strong commitment to the development of new products and believes that such efforts are important to its future prospects for profitable growth 
r d as a percentage of revenue remained steady around percent in the past three fiscal years 
the lower expenses in fiscal compared to historical levels reflected the impact of workforce reductions  though the decreased expenses were partially offset by million of incremental development costs incurred by acquired companies during fiscal fiscal expenses increased by million  primarily related to development activities associated with the solara ion 
fiscal spending on new product development is expected to continue at levels similar to those maintained in fiscal other income expense  net for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands other income expense  net other income expense primarily includes interest income  bank fees and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
other income expense in fiscal included a million non cash charge related to the recording of an other than temporary impairment of an available for sale investment 
though gerber anticipates that this investment will recover its value over time  the duration of the loss and the inability to predict when the united states stock markets will recover resulted in gerber determining that this investment was other than temporarily impaired during fiscal also included in fiscal results was a million loss from a derivative transaction 
other income expense in fiscal included a gain on the sale of a parcel of land in connecticut of million 
other income in fiscal included realized investment gains of million  which were primarily associated with sale activity within gerber s rabbi trust mutual fund portfolio during fiscal interest expense for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands interest expense weighted average credit facility interest rates interest expense primarily consists of interest costs incurred related to gerber s borrowings and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
weighted average credit facility interest rates have steadily decreased over the past three fiscal years  as a result both of declining market rates and more favorable credit facility rates associated with a refinancing completed in january gerber further amended its credit facility in march the march amendment had the effect of increasing gerber s cost of borrowing by approximately one percentage point from the january levels 
gerber s average debt balances increased in both fiscal and due to borrowings to finance acquisitions 
the january refinancing reduced the amortization expense of debt issue costs  as refinancing costs were less than costs incurred under the previous credit facility 
in connection with the credit facility amendment in march  gerber incurred a million loss for the write off of certain deferred financing costs 
in connection with the january refinancing  gerber incurred a million loss from the early extinguishment of debt related to the remaining capitalized deferred debt issuance costs associated with its previous credit facilities 
gerber s interest rates are based on market rates plus an applicable margin 
to lock in fixed market interest rates  gerber entered into two interest rate swap agreements in fiscal  each with two year terms  to fix the interest rates on million of its variable interest rate debt 
income tax expense for the fiscal years ended april  effective tax rate during fiscal  gerber merged its two french subsidiaries in order to avoid redundant administrative costs and simplify the capital structure of the entities 
the total of net operating loss carryforwards available with respect to these subsidiaries immediately prior to the merger was million 
as a result  it is more likely than not that the tax benefits from the loss carryforwards of the merged entity will be realized  and accordingly gerber reversed a million valuation reserve against these loss carryforwards 
gerber s effective tax rate would have been percent for fiscal  excluding the non recurring tax benefit from the merger of the french subsidiaries  as compared with the statutory rate of percent 
the remaining percentage points difference from the statutory rate of percent primarily reflected adjustments to tax contingencies and the effects of international rate differences 
reconciling differences for fiscal from the statutory rate of percent were primarily attributable to benefits from foreign tax rate differentials  as well as adjustments to tax contingency reserves 
benefits related to tax credits based on research and development costs also favorably impacted the effective tax rate in fiscal segment review sign making and specialty graphics the sign making and specialty graphics segment has emphasized the development and sale of the solara ion family of inkjet products  which offer advanced performance in uv inkjet printing by utilizing gerber s patent pending cold fire cure process and gerbercat cationic ink 
the cold fire cure process offers high quality material compatibility and extends the life of curing lamps used in uv printing due to lower energy output and heat generation 
gerbercat cationic ink  which offers an advanced matched print technology engine  enables printing on a wide array of both rigid and flexible substrates with high quality adhesion  abrasion resistance and color output 
while market demand for inkjet printers is outpacing that of thermal printers  gerber maintains a leadership position in the thermal imaging products line and believes that there is a continuing role for thermal imaging printers due to the large base of thermal printers still in use today 
for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands gsp spandex total gsp spandex total gsp spandex total revenue operating income loss fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal  which included the negative impact of foreign currency translations of million compared with fiscal  of which million related to gsp and million related to spandex 
gerber believes that the weak global economy  which caused uncertainty and reduced end market product demand for its customers  combined with the lack of credit availability to finance purchases  reduced demand for the segment s products and caused the majority of the remaining revenue decline in both business units 
global markets for the sign making and specialty graphics segment are expected to recover when economies in gsp s various markets stabilize 
gsp also recorded million less in patent licensing revenue in fiscal than in fiscal licensing revenue is not a predictable  recurring revenue source 
a significant portion of spandex s sales consist of sales of aftermarket supplies  including inks and vinyls 
these sales typically provide a steady stream of revenue  although volumes fluctuate based on external demand for signage 
the revenue decline in spandex s aftermarket supplies represented the majority of the business unit s decline in revenue for fiscal from fiscal partially offsetting the adverse global macroeconomic conditions were equipment sales of the solara ion and related inks  which contributed incremental revenue of million to fiscal gerber believes that economic conditions softened demand for the solara ion compared with internally expected first year launch revenue 
segment operating profit decreased million for fiscal from fiscal the decrease in operating profit reflected the impact of lower revenue  severance costs associated with the workforce reductions and higher bad debt expense associated with the worsening economic downturn 
gsp s operating loss also reflected incremental warranty costs associated with the solara ion 
savings from the workforce reductions and lack of incentive compensation cost partially mitigated the decline in operating profit 
additionally  fiscal r d spending for gsp was million lower than in fiscal  as fiscal r d expenses included incremental costs to develop the solara ion  which was launched in early fiscal a million non cash expense reduction attributable to management s decision to utilize a leased facility that was previously vacated also partially offset gsp s operating loss 
gerber anticipates that gsp s operating results will improve in fiscal with its pipeline of new products and anticipated future demand as economic conditions improve and credit markets stabilize 
fiscal segment revenue increased from fiscal by million  or percent  which included approximately million of favorable foreign currency translations 
on a business unit basis  gsp s fiscal revenue increased million from fiscal  which reflected favorable foreign currency translation of approximately million  incremental revenue of million from the may acquisition of data technology  and million in patent licensing fees 
spandex s revenue increased million from fiscal  which included million of favorable foreign currency translations 
fiscal revenue was impacted by lower inkjet printer equipment and aftermarket supplies revenue  which gerber believes occurred as a result of customer delays in inkjet printer purchases in fiscal in anticipation of the launch of the solara ion in early fiscal segment operating profit increased million in fiscal from fiscal  driven by the gross profit impact of higher revenue  increased supplier rebates related to higher sales volume purchases  and the contribution from the data technology acquisition 
higher commissions  selling and marketing costs and higher research and development expenses related to investments in developing the solara ion partially moderated segment operating performance in fiscal apparel and flexible materials apparel production has been migrating to asian markets for the past several years and is now centered in those markets 
over the past five years  gerber s apparel and flexible materials segment has increased its presence in asia  particularly within china  through geographic expansion and the completion of two key acquisitions 
gamma  acquired in september  is a china based manufacturer of equipment for apparel and flexible materials markets that is expected to expand gerber s foothold in china 
virtek  acquired in october  is a manufacturer of precision laser based templating  inspection  marking and engraving solutions used in composites material manufacturing 
while virtek s operations are located in canada and germany  it serves global customers in the prefabricated construction  transportation  metalworking  tool  die and mold making industries on a worldwide basis 
for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands segment revenue segment operating profit fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal and reflected the negative impact of million from foreign currency translations compared with fiscal gerber believes that the remaining decline in revenue was attributable to the weak global economy  which created uncertainty and reduced end market product demand for gerber technology s customers  and the lack of credit availability to finance purchases 
equipment and software product line revenue was approximately percent lower than in fiscal gerber believes this decline in revenue does not represent a loss of market share for the company  but rather reflects the adverse impacts of the economy on demand for gt s products among the business unit s customers 
china s apparel manufacturers have been significantly affected by the global recession and appear to have slowed capital equipment investments 
segment revenue from china in fiscal of million declined million  or percent  from fiscal partially offsetting these macroeconomic impacts  fiscal revenue included incremental revenue of million from the recent acquisitions 
gerber intends to utilize its global reach  service and customer relationships to increase future sales of the acquired business products  as well as to introduce virtek s products and services to customers in the flexible materials business 
key new products revenue of million reflected the introduction of several new equipment products over the last three fiscal years  including the z gerbercutter  a high performance multi ply cutting system launched in fiscal gerber believes the new product launches in fiscal were negatively impacted by global economic factors 
segment operating income for fiscal decreased million from fiscal lower software and equipment sales in fiscal led to lower gross profits and resulted in a corresponding decrease in operating profit 
additionally  fiscal bad debt expense increased million from fiscal due primarily to economic factors 
workforce reduction actions  an absence of incentive compensation cost  discretionary spending controls and lower sales and marketing expenses mitigated the full impact of lower revenue on operating income 
gerber has implemented cost savings and synergies from its recent acquisitions  including the consolidation of certain production facilities and a reduction in workforce 
those actions  which were accrued as part of purchase accounting for the acquisitions  should benefit this segment s future operating income 
fiscal segment revenue increased million  or percent  from fiscal foreign currency translation had a positive impact of million from fiscal the remaining revenue growth was primarily attributable to higher volume  including sales of the xlc multi ply gerbercutter  the taurus x series leather cutter featuring pivex technology and the gerberspreader xls  as well as to increased software and service sales 
fiscal greater china revenue of million represented an increase of million from fiscal segment operating profit for fiscal decreased million from fiscal  due principally to higher selling and marketing costs  as well as higher commissions expense 
the decrease in segment operating profit was moderated by an increased gross profit contribution of million and lower incentive compensation of million 
ophthalmic lens processing the production of free form lenses represents a growing trend within the ophthalmic industry 
free form lens processing allows the production of a progressive no line multi focal lens surface through machining rather than casting or molding processes  and enables the lens laboratory to provide other value added characteristics to the lens 
in late fiscal  gerber launched new products incorporating free form capability  which are particularly attractive to larger laboratories 
these products include the dtl generator and the maat polisher  which together form the basis for the advanced lens processing system  or alps  with free form capability 
the ophthalmic markets are continuing to undergo industry consolidations  with larger laboratories purchasing smaller independent laboratories  and large retail chains acquiring smaller chains and independent retailers  resulting in a smaller independent laboratory and retailer customer base 
for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands segment revenue segment operating profit fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal this reduction reflected million of unfavorable foreign currency translation as compared with fiscal the ophthalmic markets have been impacted by the weak global economy and the lack of credit availability to finance purchases  as well as the industry consolidations referred to above 
these factors have significantly affected equipment and aftermarket supplies revenue  resulting in lower fiscal revenue compared with historical periods 
key new product revenue was million for fiscal and included sales of the recently launched alps system 
gerber believes that the new product launches in fiscal were negatively impacted by economic conditions 
fiscal segment revenue decreased million  or percent  from fiscal and reflected million of favorable foreign currency translation compared with fiscal gerber believes that the overall decrease in revenue was driven by industry consolidations  resulting in lower equipment and aftermarket supplies sales 
fiscal segment revenue included million of key new product revenue 
despite lower revenue  this segment has maintained operating margins of approximately percent in the past two years by significantly lowering its cost structure through workforce reductions and lean manufacturing initiatives 
segment operating profit decreased million  or percent  in fiscal from fiscal the decrease reflected the impact of lower gross profit and higher bad debt expense of million related to macroeconomic factors 
the decline was significantly mitigated by cost savings from workforce reductions and lower r d expenses 
fiscal operating profit growth demonstrated the success of cost control measures and the benefits of gerber s shared services model 
partially offsetting these benefits in fiscal  r d expenses were higher related to the investment of development costs for the alps system 
corporate expenses for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands corporate operating expenses corporate operating expenses in fiscal decreased million from fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from the non recurrence of expenses incurred in fiscal  including fiscal severance costs recorded within corporate expenses of million 
fiscal expenses did not include incentive compensation expense  as gerber did not meet performance objectives 
fiscal expenses included incentive compensation expense of million 
fiscal also included accounting professional fees associated with gerber s adoption of fin of million and other incremental accounting professional fees of million 
partially offsetting these items  higher self insurance costs of million and higher defined pension benefit costs of million were expensed in fiscal the higher defined benefit costs included a curtailment loss of million associated with the pension plan benefits freeze implemented as of april  corporate operating expenses in fiscal were million lower than in fiscal primarily from lower pension expense of million  lower self insurance costs of million and lower stock option compensation expense of million 
partially offsetting these benefits  fiscal corporate expenses included million of professional fees to implement fin and incremental severance expense of million as compared with fiscal fiscal corporate operating expenses included million of professional fees associated with the fiscal year end audit procedures that did not recur in fiscal financial condition liquidity and capital resources gerber s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the company s million senior secured revolving credit facility 
these sources of liquidity are subject to all of the risks of gerber s business  including those described in item a 
risk factors  and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for gerber s products  charges that may be required because of changes in market conditions or other costs of doing business  delayed product introductions or adverse changes to availability of funds 
global distress in the credit and financial markets has reduced liquidity and credit availability and increased volatility in prices of securities across most markets 
gerber performed an assessment of this difficult financial environment and challenging global credit market situation and its potential impacts to its operations as of april  although gerber has not experienced changes in credit availability  and does not currently anticipate such changes  gerber s sales declined significantly in fiscal gerber has taken measures to control costs in order to partially offset the impact of further revenue declines on its results of operations and cash flows from operations 
after assessing the consequences of this difficult financial environment  and although the duration and extent of future market turmoil cannot be predicted  gerber does not currently expect that the credit market conditions will have a significant negative impact on its liquidity  financial position or operations in fiscal as compared with fiscal gerber believes that its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowings expected to be available under its revolving credit facility will enable gerber to meet its ongoing cash requirements for at least the next months 
as of april   cash balances were million and million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility  based on its financial covenants 
after the foregoing period  gerber may require additional capital for investment in its business 
the amount and timing of any additional investment will depend on the anticipated demand for gerber s products  the availability of funds and other factors 
the actual amount and timing of gerber s future capital requirements may differ materially from the company s estimates depending on the demand for its products and new market developments and opportunities 
if the company s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  the foregoing sources of funds may prove to be insufficient 
in addition  if gerber successfully completes any acquisitions of other businesses or if it seeks to accelerate the expansion of its business  it may be required to seek additional capital 
additional sources of such capital may include equity and debt financing 
if gerber believes it can obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  it may seek such financing at any time  to the extent that market conditions and other factors permit it to do so 
any inability of gerber to generate the sufficient funds that it may require or to obtain such funds under reasonable terms could limit its ability to increase revenue or operate profitability 
the continuation of impaired equity and credit markets and restrictions under gerber s revolving credit facility could adversely impact gerber s ability to raise any required funds 
the following table provides information about gerber s capitalization as of the dates indicated april  in thousands except ratio amounts cash and cash equivalents working capital total debt net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents shareholders equity total capital net debt plus shareholders equity current ratio net debt to total capital ratio cash flows the following table provides information about gerber s cash flows as of the dates indicated for the fiscal years ended april  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities in fiscal reflected operating earnings and working capital improvements 
gerber realized a significant amount of cash from its accounts receivable in fiscal as a result of strong cash collections 
gerber also reduced its inventories from april  levels 
cash was utilized to pay vendors and fiscal bonuses  as well as pension plan contributions of million 
gerber anticipates that it will fund its pension plans million in fiscal  and may elect to make additional  voluntary contributions in excess of that amount 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal and was from operating earnings and was partially used to fund working capital increases  especially during fiscal as compared with fiscal accounts receivable increased in both years as a result of elevated sales volume during gerber s fourth quarter as compared with the same periods in the corresponding prior years 
the increase in inventories in both years reflected planned increases for new products and an investment in carrying a higher quantity of aftermarket supplies to satisfy customer demands 
the fluctuation in accounts payable for both years was primarily related to the timing of cash payments 
gerber funded its pension plans with contributions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily for the acquisitions of virtek and gamma totaling million and million for capital expenditures 
capital expenditures included investments in information technology for customer relationship management software  machinery  equipment and tooling for new products and capitalized software costs 
gerber expects fiscal capital expenditures will total approximately million to million 
gerber may invest additional funds in new acquisitions of businesses that satisfy its acquisition criteria

partially offsetting the decrease was the addition of acquired accounts receivable from the acquisitions 
days sales outstanding was days as of april  compared with days as of april  inventories decreased to million as of april  from million as of april   primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translations and a focus on inventory management 
inventories added from the acquisitions partially offset the decrease 
inventory turnover decreased to times annually as of april  compared with times annually as of april  due to the lower sales volume

pension plan contributions of million partially offset the overall increase 
long term debt gerber entered into a credit agreement on january  with several banks and other financial institutions and lenders specified in the agreement and rbs citizens  na  in its capacity as administrative agent for the lenders and amended the credit agreement in march the lenders under the credit agreement have extended gerber a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
in addition  gerber may elect  subject to compliance with specified conditions  to solicit the lenders under the credit agreement to increase by up to million the total principal amount of borrowings available under the credit facility 
the facility matures on january outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to  at gerber s option  the defined applicable base rate  or abr  or the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a variable margin 
an annual commitment fee is payable quarterly based upon the unused amount of the credit agreement at a specified margin 
the margins and commitment fees are based on gerber s ratio of total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as illustrated in the table below total funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio abr margin basis points libor margin basis points commitment fee basis points x and greater x to less than x x to less than x x to less than x less than x the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  financial covenants and events of default 
gerber s performance under the credit agreement is collateralized by first priority liens on selected assets and the pledge of capital stock of gerber and certain of its subsidiaries 
the financial covenants in the credit agreement include the ratio of total funded debt to consolidated ebitda  which requires gerber to maintain a ratio less than beginning with the quarter ended april  through the quarter ending october   a ratio of for the quarter ending january  through the quarter ending april  and for the quarter ending july  and thereafter 
a ratio of consolidated ebit to consolidated interest expense requires gerber to maintain a ratio greater than for the quarter ended april   for the quarter ending july   for the quarter ending october   for the quarter ending january   for the quarter ending april  and for the quarter ending july  and thereafter 
the credit agreement also contains a maximum capital expenditures covenant  which limits gerber to annual capital expenditures of not more than million 
gerber also must comply with a minimum asset coverage covenant ratio at least ratio of specified assets to total funded debt 
such assets include cash in the united states and canada  plus percent of consolidated net accounts receivable plus percent of consolidated inventories and million for consolidated fixed assets 
the definition of ebitda in the credit agreement excludes  among other items  certain gains and expenses  including other than temporary impairment asset charges  non cash stock compensation  non recurring fees and expenses associated with the credit agreement amendment executed in march  and non cash purchase accounting adjustments that amortize into ebitda and includes  among other items  pro forma ebitda from acquired companies 
gerber was in compliance with its financial covenants as of april   as shown in the following table covenant requirement actual as of april  total funded debt to consolidated ebitda less than consolidated ebit to consolidated interest expense greater than asset coverage ratio at least gerber s future compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement depends primarily on its success in generating sufficient operating cash flows  which could be adversely affected by various economic  financial and industrial factors 
noncompliance with the covenants would constitute an event of default under the credit facility  potentially allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding borrowings 
in the event of failure by gerber to continue to be in compliance with any covenants  gerber would seek to negotiate amendments to the applicable covenants or obtain compliance waivers from its lenders 
the credit agreement contains certain subjective acceleration causes under which  upon the occurrence of a change in gerber s financial condition  business or operations considered by the lenders to be materially adverse to gerber  the lenders may cause amounts due under the agreement to become immediately due and payable 
the credit agreement also contains certain cross default provisions  which provide that default by gerber under other lending arrangements could cause gerber to be in default under the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements gerber s participation in financing arrangements to assist customers in obtaining leases with third parties constitute the only off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the sec s regulation s k 
gerber has agreements with major financial services institutions  or lessors  to assist gerber s customers  or lessees  in obtaining lease financing to purchase gerber s equipment 
equipment is typically leased for periods of two to six years 
the equipment sold collateralizes the lease receivables 
in the event of default by the lessee  gerber has a liability to the financial services institution under recourse provisions once the institution repossesses the equipment from the lessee and returns it to gerber 
in most cases  gerber then can resell the equipment  the proceeds of which are expected to substantially cover a majority of the liability to the financial services institution 
as of april   the amount of lease receivables financed under the agreements between the external financial services institutions and the lessees was million 
gerber s net exposure related to recourse provisions under these agreements was approximately million 
as of april  and  gerber recorded undiscounted accruals for the expected losses under recourse provisions of million for both periods 
contractual cash obligations and commitments as of april   gerber had the following contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations lease obligations inventory and other purchase obligations qualified and non qualified pension funding total principal only  excludes interest payments 
the contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments table does not include any non discretionary pension contributions for fiscal although gerber anticipates making contributions subsequent to fiscal  the amounts of any such contributions have been excluded from the table  since the timing of such contributions is based on plan assumptions that may materially differ from actual plan activities 
amounts included in the table for pension contributions relate to the funding of benefit payments under gerber s non qualified pension plan and small international pension plans 
the above table does not reflect contingent acquisition payments including potential earn outs related to the acquisitions of gamma in fiscal and data technology in fiscal the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for more information about such tax benefits 
critical accounting estimates gerber s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and the most significant of these are described in detail below 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  with cost being determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  cost method 
inventory at the apparel and flexible materials segment s foreign non manufacturing companies is valued on a weighted average basis  which approximates fifo 
gerber reviews the market value of inventory on an ongoing basis and records inventory write downs as necessary to reflect estimated obsolescence  excess quantities and market value 
the amount of these write downs equals the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
excess and obsolete inventory is generally identified by comparing expected inventory usage to actual on hand quantities and inventory write downs are recorded when on hand inventory is in excess of pre defined usage estimates 
usage estimates are primarily determined by projecting historical actual inventory usage levels for future periods 
application of this methodology can have the effect of increasing inventory write downs during periods of declining demand 
inventories included a million reduction as of april  for the estimated lower of cost or market adjustment against gerber s standard costs 
goodwill gerber reviews the value of goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter  or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
no goodwill impairment was recorded during fiscal the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves subjective estimation of the fair value of reporting units  using substantial estimates and assumptions that could affect whether an impairment charge is recognized and the amount thereof 
to assess goodwill for impairment  internal valuation analyses are performed 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analysis  which uses estimates and assumptions  including projected cash flows  and estimated discount rate assumptions and perpetual growth rates 
a percent decrease in the fair value of gerber s reporting units at the fiscal evaluation date would not have resulted in any goodwill impairments 
as of april   gerber had million of goodwill assets on its consolidated balance sheet which management believes are realizable based on the estimated cash flows of the associated businesses 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used in assessing that value  such as future sales and expense levels  may need to be re evaluated in the case of further market deterioration  which could result in future impairment of those assets 
pension plans effective on april   gerber froze future benefit accruals under the gerber scientific  inc and participating subsidiaries pension plan  or pension plan  and the gerber scientific  inc and participating subsidiaries supplemental pension benefit plan  or serp 
all benefits already accrued under the pension plan and the serp remained intact  and service credits for retirement eligibility continue in accordance with the terms of each plan 
the amounts recognized in gerber s consolidated financial statements for the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined from actuarial valuations 
these valuations use assumptions relating to  among other variables  the expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled  the rate of increase in future compensation levels and amortization methodologies for unrecognized actuarial losses 
these assumptions are updated at the measurement date and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is developed by considering current and expected target asset allocation  historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium  an inflation estimate weighted towards future expectations  expectations for real returns  and adjustments for anticipated or historical economic changes using a long term investment horizon 
the effects of asset diversification and periodic fund rebalancing are also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent and will be percent for fiscal with all other assumptions remaining constant  an increase or decrease of percentage points in the expected long term rate of return of the plan assets would increase or decrease fiscal consolidated income before income taxes by approximately million 
as of april  and  and for the years ended april  and ending april   the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the pension plans was based on gerber s estimated future cash payments mapped against expected yields of high quality  long term corporate bonds from a benchmark yield curve 
the discount rate used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent and will be percent for fiscal with all other assumptions remaining constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate for the plans would increase or decrease fiscal consolidated income before income taxes by approximately million 
the assumed rate of increase in compensation levels was calculated based primarily on expected wage inflation prior to the freeze of the pension plans 
for fiscal  the assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels used for determining net periodic pension expense was percent 
the rate of compensation increase is no longer relevant to benefit obligations as of april  and thereafter with the effect of the pension plan benefits freeze on april gerber historically amortized unrecognized net actuarial losses over the expected remaining service period of its plan participants 
with the effect of each plan freeze  gerber changed its amortization period of unrecognized net actuarial losses to span over the estimated life expectancy of its plan participants 
the effect of this change on fiscal pension expense is a reduction of approximately million as compared to the historical amortization method 
pension expense for fiscal is expected to be approximately million 
in subsequent fiscal years  future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  contributions  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in gerber s pension plans 
income taxes gerber accounts for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  gerber estimates future taxable income  available tax planning strategies and the ability to realize tax loss and credit carryforwards 
in estimating future taxable income  gerber has analyzed its historical earnings in each jurisdiction and considered the effect of certain nonrecurring items that negatively impacted earnings in those periods 
gerber has also considered the favorable shift in profits between various jurisdictions resulting from tax planning strategies in assessing the ability to realize its deferred tax assets 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event gerber were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  if gerber were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as an increase to income in the period such determination was made 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement assuming the tax authority has full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
gerber operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the internal revenue service and other tax authorities routinely review gerber s tax returns 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the impact of these examinations on gerber s liability for income taxes cannot be presently determined 
in management s opinion  adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from these examinations based on gerber s estimated range of exposure 
gerber has not recognized united states tax expense on the unremitted earnings and other basis differences with respect to certain of its foreign subsidiaries because it is not anticipated that such earnings will be remitted to the united states 
these undistributed earnings and basis differences were approximately million as of april  gerber plans to reinvest these earnings permanently outside of the united states or only repatriate the earnings when it is advantageous to do so 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events  or sfas  which will be effective for gerber on may  the provisions of sfas will require additional disclosures surrounding subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date and before the financial statements are available to be issued or issued

therefore  basic earnings per share will include gerber s unvested restricted stock awards upon adoption 
additionally  fsp eitf requires retrospective adjustment to all prior period earnings per share data 
the adoption of fsp eitf is not expected to materially impact the disclosures of historical earnings per share

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gerber is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
credit market risk exposures distress in credit and financial markets has reduced liquidity and credit availability and increased volatility in prices of securities 
after assessing the consequences of this difficult financial environment  and although the duration and extent of future market turmoil cannot be predicted  gerber does not currently expect that the credit market conditions will have a material adverse impact on its liquidity  financial position  operations or cash flows in fiscal as compared with fiscal foreign currency exposures gerber identifies and manages its foreign currency exposures at the corporate level and uses specific planning strategies by region and operation unit  which may include the use of foreign currency forward contracts  international tax transfer pricing strategies and intercompany loan planning strategies 
there were no foreign currency forward contracts in place as of april  interest rate exposures gerber finances its operations primarily through variable interest rate debt and is thus subject to market risk due to interest rate volatility 
to moderate the impact of that volatility  gerber has entered into interest rate swap agreements that exchange variable libor interest for fixed interest rates of percent on million of revolving credit facility debt and percent on million of such debt effective through fiscal as of april   remaining obligations under gerber s credit facility bore interest at floating rates  at gerber s option  at an annual rate equal either to libor or the defined applicable borrowing rate plus a variable margin  which varies based upon certain financial measurements 
a percent increase in the interest rate applicable to million of variable rate credit facility debt that is not fixed by derivative instruments would increase interest expense approximately million annually 
obligations under the outstanding million of industrial development bonds accrue interest at rates that are adjusted weekly to market rates 
a percent increase in the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance on these bonds would not have a material impact to gerber s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
