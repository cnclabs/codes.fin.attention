the company is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  loss of their services could adversely affect the company s operations 
compliance with corporate governance and disclosure standards 
the company has spent and continues to spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley  sec regulations and stock exchange rules 
section of sarbanes oxley requires management s annual review and evaluation of the company s internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these controls by management 
because the company qualifies as a smaller reporting company  the company s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to provide an attestation report 
in early  the company completed its first section report for the year ended december  the company continued to enhance its internal controls during and completed its annual review and evaluation of its internal controls and issued its section report for the year ended december  in april however  there is no guarantee that the company will receive management assurance or an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that internal control over financial reporting is effective in future periods 
in the event that the company s chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that the company s internal control over financial reporting is not effective as required by section of sarbanes oxley  investor perceptions of the company may be adversely affected 
in addition  overhead may increase as a result of the additional costs associated with complying with the complex legal requirements associated with being a public reporting company 
risks related to our textile products business the company s textile products business may be affected by the following risk factors  each of which could adversely affect the company 
suppliers 
brookwood purchases a significant amount of the fabric and other materials it processes and sells from a small number of suppliers 
brookwood believes that the loss of any one of its suppliers would not have a long term material adverse effect because other manufacturers with which brookwood conducts business would be able to fulfill those requirements 
however  the loss of certain of brookwood s suppliers could  in the short term  adversely affect brookwood s business until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new supply arrangements would have terms as favorable as those contained in current supply arrangements 
some of brookwood s suppliers are entering the military markets in competition to brookwood  targeting specific military specifications  however  there has been no material effect upon brookwood s business relationship to date 
brookwood is monitoring its suppliers and any effect the current economic crisis may have upon their ability to deliver required materials in a timely manner 
the financial markets inability to determine the extent and longevity of the current economic downturn may have an effect upon key and multiple suppliers which cannot be determined at this time 
as of march   brookwood has not experienced any significant disruptions in supply as a result of shortages in fabrics or other materials from its suppliers 
sales concentration 
brookwood has several customers who have accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in one or more of the three years ended december  sales to one brookwood customer  tennier industries  inc tennier  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in each of the three years ended december  its relationship with tennier is ongoing 
sales to tennier  which are included in military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
sales to another customer  orc industries  inc orc  
table of contents accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in and its relationship with orc is ongoing

brookwood s relationship with the customer is ongoing 
sales to that customer  which are also included in military sales  were  in  which represented of brookwood s sales 
military sales were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial growth in its military business  there is no assurance this trend will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been more volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
the military had limited orders in and the first quarter for existing products and adopted revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
however  the us government released orders in the remaining quarters and into for goods that include brookwood s products  which resulted in a substantial increase in military sales 
changes in specifications or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
the company acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
concentration of credit 
the financial instruments that potentially subject brookwood to concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable 
brookwood grants credit to customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer s financial condition 
brookwood manages its exposure to credit risks through credit approvals  credit limits  monitoring procedures and the use of factors 
brookwood continues to monitor its customers and the effect the current economic crisis may have upon their ability to fulfill their obligations to brookwood in a timely manner 
the financial markets inability to determine the extent and longevity of the current economic downturn may have an effect upon brookwood s customers that cannot be determined at this time 
as of march   brookwood s key customers were complying with their payment terms 
the amount of receivables that brookwood can factor is subject to certain limitations as specified in individual factoring agreements 
the factoring agreements expose brookwood to credit risk if any of the factors fail to meet their obligations 
brookwood seeks to manage this risk by conducting business with a number of reputable factors and monitoring the factors performance under their agreements 
brookwood continues to monitor its factors and the effect the current economic crisis may have upon their ability to fulfill their obligations to brookwood in a timely manner 
the financial markets inability to determine the extent and longevity of the current economic downturn may have an effect upon brookwood s factors that cannot be determined at this time 
as of march   all of brookwood s factors were complying with payment terms in accordance with factor agreements 
loan covenants 
brookwood s revolving credit agreement requires compliance with various loan covenants and financial ratios  principally a total debt to tangible net worth ratio of and a requirement that net income in each quarter must exceed one dollar 
brookwood was in compliance with its principal loan covenants as of december  and and for all interim periods during and  although a waiver regarding a pro forma inclusive of projected dividend total debt to tangible net worth ratio for the third quarter was granted to allow a  dividend payment in november and an amendment to the revolving credit facility was entered into in june to allow a  dividend payment in june and restrict calendar total dividends from brookwood to

among the many environmental requirements applicable to kenyon and brookwood laminating are laws relating to air emissions  ozone depletion  wastewater discharges and the handling  disposal and release of solid and hazardous substances and wastes 
based on continuing internal review and advice from independent consultants  kenyon and brookwood laminating believe that they are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are also subject to such laws as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on site or off site locations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are not aware of any releases for which they may be liable under cercla or any analogous provision 
actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could increase the cost of producing the products manufactured by kenyon and brookwood laminating or otherwise adversely affect demand for their products 
widespread adoption of any prohibitions or restrictions could adversely affect the cost and or the ability to produce products and thereby have a material adverse effect upon kenyon  brookwood laminating or brookwood 
brookwood does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental requirements 
some risk of environmental liability is inherent  however  in the nature of brookwood s business 
there can be no assurance that material environmental liabilities will not arise 
it is also possible that future developments in environmental regulation could lead to material environmental compliance or cleanup costs 
patent and trademark 
brookwood considers its patents and trademarks  in the aggregate  to be important to its business and seeks to protect this proprietary know how in part through us patent and trademark registrations 
no assurance can be given  however  that such protection will give brookwood any material competitive advantage 
in addition  brookwood maintains certain trade secrets for which  in order to maintain the confidentiality of such trade secrets  it has not sought patent or trademark protection 
as a result  such trade secrets could be infringed upon and such infringement could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position 
in july  nextec applications inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york claiming that brookwood infringed five united states patents pertaining to internally coated webs 
brookwood timely answered the lawsuit 
nextec sought leave of court to add two additional patents to the lawsuit us patent no 
 and  the court granted leave to nextec  and nextec filed its amended complaint september  brookwood intends to vigorously defend all claims 
refer to item legal proceedings for a further description of this lawsuit 
competition 
the cyclical nature of the textile and apparel industries  characterized by rapid shifts in military procurement  fashion and consumer demand and competitive pressures  results in both price and demand volatility 
the demand for any particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in military specifications  consumer and industrial preferences  and general economic conditions affecting the textile and apparel industries  such as consumer expenditures for non durable goods 
the textile and apparel industries are also cyclical because the supply of particular products changes as competitors enter or leave the market 
brookwood sells primarily to domestic manufacturers  some of which operate offshore sewing operations 
some of brookwood s customers have moved their business offshore during the past few years 
brookwood has responded by shipping fabric asia to asia and also by supplying finished products and garments directly to manufacturers 
brookwood competes with numerous domestic and foreign fabric manufacturers  including companies larger in size and having greater financial resources than brookwood 
the principal competitive factors in the woven fabrics markets are price  service  delivery time  quality and flexibility  with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the needs of particular customers and the specific product offering 
brookwood s management believes that brookwood maintains its ability to compete effectively by providing its customers with a broad array of high quality fabrics at competitive prices on a timely basis 
there are an increasing number of competitors entering the military market 
these competitors vary and include converters from other market segments  as well as major mills  some of which are brookwood suppliers  
table of contents who are selectively targeting specific military specifications 
as these companies enter the military market  the competitive pressures may result in further price and demand volatility 
brookwood s competitive position varies by product line 
there are several major domestic competitors in the synthetic fabrics business  none of which dominates the market 
brookwood believes  however  that it has a strong competitive position 
in addition  brookwood believes it is one of a few finishers successful in printing camouflage on nylon for sale to apparel suppliers of the us government 
additional competitive strengths of brookwood include knowledge of its customers business needs  its ability to design and produce special fabrics such as textured blends  waterproof breathable fabrics  state of the art fabric finishing equipment at its facilities  substantial vertical integration  and its ability to communicate electronically with its customers 
imports and worldwide trade practices 
imports of foreign made textile and apparel products are a significant source of competition for most sectors of the domestic textile industry 
the us government has attempted to regulate the growth of certain textile and apparel imports through tariffs and bilateral agreements  which establish quotas on imports from lesser developed countries that historically account for significant shares of us imports 
despite these efforts  imported apparel  which represents the area of heaviest import penetration  is estimated to represent in excess of of the us market 
the us textile industry has been and continues to be negatively impacted by existing worldwide trade practices  including the north american free trade agreement nafta  anti dumping and duty enforcement activities by the us government and by the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies 
the establishment of the world trade organization wto in has resulted in the phase out of quotas on textiles and apparel  effective january  notwithstanding quota elimination  china s accession agreement for membership in the wto provides that wto member countries including the united states  canada and european countries may re impose quotas on specific categories of products in the event it is determined that imports from china have surged and are threatening to create a market disruption for such categories of products 
during  the united states and china agreed to a new quota arrangement  which imposed quotas on certain textile products through the end of the united states may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported from china or other countries in such increased quantities as to cause or threaten serious damage to the relevant domestic industry generally known as anti dumping actions 
in addition  china has imposed an export tax on all textile products manufactured in china  brookwood does not believe this tax will have a material impact on its business 
the united states and china have not finalized a new quota arrangement subsequent to december  under nafta there are no textile and apparel quotas between the us and either mexico or canada for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the three countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
also  the wto recently phased out textile and apparel quotas 
the us has also approved the central american free trade agreement cafta with several central american countries costa rica  the dominican republic  el salvador  guatemala  honduras and nicaragua 
under cafta  textile and apparel originating from cafta countries will be duty and quota free  provided that yarn formed in the united states or other cafta countries is used to produce the fabric 
in addition  the united states recently implemented bilateral free trade agreements with bahrain  chile  israel  jordan  morocco and singapore 
although these actions have the effect of exposing brookwood s market to the lower price structures of the other countries and  therefore  continuing to increase competitive pressures  management is not able to predict their specific impact 
in  the us government unveiled a proposal to eliminate worldwide tariffs for manufactured goods by the european union has also proposed significant reductions in tariffs 
these proposals have been discussed during the ongoing wto doha round of multilateral negotiations  and could lead to further significant changes in worldwide tariffs beyond those already anticipated 
accordingly  brookwood believes it must fully utilize other competitive strategies to replace sales lost to importers 
one strategy is to identify new market niches 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer application is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing enterprise value of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and 
table of contents adapt to the global textile industry  however  there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 
the us government engaged in discussions with a number of countries or trading blocs with the intent of further liberalizing trade 
authority to negotiate new fast track agreements has been granted by congress  making new agreements in this field more likely 
the us government has also entered into a free trade agreement with australia  bahrain  chile  israel  jordan  morocco and singapore 
labor relations 
kenyon entered into a three year collective bargaining agreement with the unite here union  representing approximately employees at its rhode island plant facility  effective from march  through february  the union has expressed concerns over certain aspects of that agreement 
kenyon s management continues to work in good faith to maintain its previous positive relationship with its union employees  as it has with its non union employees 
brookwood is dependent on its key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
brookwood is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
risks related to our energy business the company s energy investment may be affected by the following risk factors  each of which could adversely affect the value of the investment 
bankruptcy filing by hallwood energy 
on march   hallwood energy  lp  hem the general partner of hallwood energy  and hallwood energy s subsidiaries  filed petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the cases are being jointly administered and are pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas  dallas division  in in re hallwood energy  lp  et al  case no 
in addition  as described under item legal proceedings  hallwood energy has filed a lawsuit against the company seeking that the company contribute to hallwood energy an additional million pursuant to an equity support agreement 
the bankruptcy court has granted hallwood energy authority to use its existing cash collateral for operating needs through may on april   hallwood energy s primary secured lender filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay seeking authority to foreclose on real and personal property owned by hallwood energy 
hallwood energy will be seeking to develop a plan of reorganization with the goal of enabling it to continue operations 
however  hallwood energy has not yet proposed a plan and there is no assurance that a plan will be developed  approved or successfully implemented or that the existing investors in hallwood energy will have any continuing interest in the reorganized entity 
accordingly  the extent or value of the company s continuing interest in hallwood energy  if any  is uncertain 
volatility of natural gas prices 
a decline in natural gas prices could adversely affect financial results 
revenues  operating results  profitability  cash flows  future rate of growth and the value of the natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices received for natural gas sold 
historically  the markets for natural gas have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
wide fluctuations in natural gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond the company s control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of natural gas  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and the overall economic environment 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future natural gas price movements 
declines in natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue  but could reduce the amount of natural gas that can be produced economically and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations and reserves for hallwood energy 
drilling activities 
hallwood energy s success is materially dependent upon the success of its drilling program 
future drilling activities may not be successful and  if drilling activities are unsuccessful  such failure will have an adverse effect on hallwood energy s future results of operations and financial condition 
oil and gas 
table of contents drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered  even if the reserves targeted are classified as proved 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
although numerous drilling prospects have been identified  there can be no assurance that such prospects will be drilled or that oil or natural gas will be produced from any such identified prospects or any other prospects 
significant capital expenditures required 
hallwood energy s acquisition  exploration and development activities require substantial capital expenditures 
historically  these capital expenditures have been funded through operations  debt and equity issuances 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  such as level of production  natural gas prices and its success in developing and producing new reserves  as well as availability of additional debt or equity capital 
hallwood energy requires access to debt and equity capital in order to have sufficient funds to complete the capital expenditures required to fully develop its reserves 
regulations 
the oil and gas industry is subject to regulation at the federal  state and local level  and some of the laws  rules and regulations carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances covering drilling and well operations 
operations are also subject to various conservation regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units and the unitization or pooling of oil or natural gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production 
environmental regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment  the disposal of contaminants and the protection of public health  natural resources and wildlife affect exploration  development and production operations 
under state and federal laws  hallwood energy could be required to remove or remedy previously disposed wastes or suspend operations in contaminated areas or perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
competition 
hallwood energy operates in a highly competitive area of acquisition  development  exploration and production of natural gas properties with competitors who have greater financial and other resources 
competitors from both major and independent oil and natural gas companies may be able to pay more for development prospects than the financial resources or human resources of hallwood energy permit 
hallwood energy s ability to develop and exploit its natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on its ability to successfully conduct operations  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
quantity and present value of reserves 
financial information for hallwood energy is based on estimates of proved reserves and the estimated future net revenues for the proved reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions relating to natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas reserves is complex and these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual results will most likely vary from these estimates 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of an estimate 
operational hazards 
natural gas operations are subject to many environmental hazards and risks  including well blowouts  cratering and explosions  pipe failures  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of natural gas  brine or well fluids  and other hazards and risks 
drilling operations involve risks from high pressures and mechanical difficulties such as stuck pipes  collapsed casings and separated cables 
if any of these risks occur  substantial losses could result from injury or loss of life  severe damages to or destruction of property  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations 
insurance is maintained against some of these risks  but may not adequately cover all of a catastrophic loss 
loan indebtedness and covenants 
in april  hallwood energy entered into a  senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility with an affiliate of one of the investors 
as of 
table of contents december   hallwood energy borrowed the full amount available under the senior secured credit facility and in january  entered into a second loan facility the junior credit facility and together with the senior secured credit facility  the secured credit facilities with the same lender and borrowed the full  available under the junior credit facility 
the level of indebtedness affects hallwood energy s operations in various ways a portion of cash flows must be used to service the debt and is not available for other purposes  it may put hallwood energy at a competitive disadvantage as compared to companies with less debt  and loan covenants may limit hallwood energy s financial and operational flexibility 
the secured credit facilities contain various financial covenants  including maximum general and administrative expenditures and current and proved collateral coverage ratios 
hallwood energy is in default of various covenants under the secured credit facilities  but under the automatic stay provisions of the united states bankruptcy code  hallwood energy s lender has not been able to foreclose on its collateral 
the secured credit facilities contain a make whole provision whereby hallwood energy is required to pay the lender the present value amount of interest that would have been payable on the principal balance of the loan from the date of prepayment through february  item b

in august  the rhode island department of health ridoh issued a compliance order to kenyon  alleging that kenyon is a non community water system and ordering kenyon to comply with the ridoh program for public water supply systems 
kenyon contested the compliance order and an administrative hearing was held in november no decision was ever rendered by ridoh 
however  by letter dated july   the united states environmental protection agency epa advised kenyon that it is the epa s position that the kenyon facility is a public water system and is subject to regulation under the safe drinking water act 
as a result  in january   kenyon entered into a consent order with ridoh agreeing to apply for a public water license and submit plans to comply with the aforementioned regulations 
conformance with the consent order will require the company to revamp kenyon s water supply system  at an anticipated minimum cost of in august  kenyon received a notice of alleged violation from the rhode island department of environmental management ridem that alleged that kenyon had failed to comply timely with a requirement to test the destruction efficiency of a thermal oxidizer at its kenyon plant 
the notice further alleged that when the test was conducted  the equipment did not operate at the required efficiency 
since that time  kenyon upgraded and retested the equipment and demonstrated compliance with the destruction efficiency requirement 
ridem requested additional information regarding the testing and kenyon s remedial actions  which kenyon has provided 
in february  ridem issued a formal notice of violation nov in this matter  seeking a  fine 
kenyon requested an informal hearing to dispute the allegations in the nov and the fine 
an informal hearing was held in march and a consent agreement was executed 
a  fine was remitted to ridem to close this matter 
in june  ridem issued a nov to kenyon  alleging that kenyon violated certain provisions of its wastewater discharge permit and seeking an administrative penalty of  kenyon filed an answer and request for hearing in which it disputed certain allegations in the nov and the amount of the penalty 
an informal meeting was held with ridem in august following settlement negotiations  a consent agreement was executed in june the consent agreement required the company to pay a  fine and perform two supplemental environmental projects seps at a total cost of  as of march  one sep had been completed 
the company is presently awaiting ridem approval of the engineering plans for the second sep 
once the approval is received  the second sep will be performed 
the company anticipates that the second sep will be completed during item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the period

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company currently operates as a holding company with interests in textiles and energy 
until july  the company had interests in textiles  real estate and various energy affiliates 
since that time  the company disposed of its interests in hallwood realty partners  lp hrp in july  which constituted substantially all of its real estate activities  and hallwood energy corporation hec and hallwood energy iii  lp he iii  two of its energy affiliates  in december and july  respectively 
textile products 
in the three years ended december   the company derived all of its operating revenues from the textile activities of its brookwood subsidiary  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its ability to continue sales to existing customers  cost and availability of supplies  brookwood s response to competition  its ability to generate new markets and products and the effect of global trade regulations 
although the company s textile activities have generated positive cash flow in recent years  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial growth in its military business  there is no assurance this trend will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend the company believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the increased activity of the us military 
if this activity does not continue or declines  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
military sales of   and  for  and  respectively  were higher in and higher in from the respective previous years 
the military had limited orders in and in the first quarter for existing products and adopted revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
however  the us government released orders in the remaining quarters and during for goods that include brookwood s products  which resulted in a substantial increase in military sales 
changes in specifications or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
the company acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
unstable global nylon and chemical pricing  and volatile domestic energy costs  coupled with a varying product mix  have continued to cause fluctuations in brookwood s margins  a trend that will potentially continue 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches to replace sales lost to imports 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has been developing advanced breathable  waterproof laminates and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing success of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and adapt to the global textile industry 
there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 
the textile products business is not interdependent with the company s other business operations 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank facility and is not obligated to contribute additional capital 
conversely  brookwood does not guarantee debts of the company or any of the company s subsidiaries and is not obligated to contribute additional capital to the company beyond dividend payments and the tax sharing agreement 
energy 
hallwood energy is a privately held independent oil and gas limited partnership and operates as an upstream energy company engaging in the acquisition  development  exploration  production  and sale of hydrocarbons  with a primary focus on natural gas assets 
as of december   the company had invested  in hallwood energy  which represented of the blended class a and class c limited partner 
table of contents interests after consideration of profit interests of hallwood energy 
in addition  the company loaned hallwood energy  in the form of convertible notes issued by hallwood energy 
in june  hallwood energy entered into an agreement for the sale and farmout to fei shale  lp fei  a subsidiary of talisman energy  inc of an undivided interest in up to of hallwood energy s interest in substantially all its assets for a series of payments of up to  an initial payment of  and the option to pay up to an additional  and entered into an agreement to provide consulting services to the purchaser for one year the talisman energy transaction 
in october  fei elected to make a second payment of  to hallwood energy 
in february  fei elected to make a partial funding in the amount of  related to its third payment 
on march   hallwood energy  lp  hem the general partner of hallwood energy and hallwood energy s subsidiaries  filed petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the cases are pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas  dallas division  in in re hallwood energy  lp  etal case no 
the company is only an investor in and creditor of hallwood energy 
the bankruptcy filing does not include the company or any other of its assets

refer also to the section investments in hallwood energy for a further description of the company s energy activities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
on occasion  brookwood receives instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory until the customer sends shipping instructions 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and identifies the inventory as separate from brookwood s inventory 
generally  a customer provides such instructions to accommodate its lack of available storage space for inventory 
this practice is customary in the textile industry and with respect to certain brookwood customers 
in these cases  the brookwood customer either dictates delivery dates at the time the order is placed or when the customer has not specified a fixed delivery date  the customer owns the goods and has asked brookwood to keep them in the warehouse until the customer provides a delivery date 
for all of its bill and hold sales  brookwood has no future obligations  the customer is billed when the product is ready for shipment and expected to pay under standard billing and credit terms  regardless of the actual delivery date  and the inventory is identified and not available for brookwood s use 
brookwood s total bill and hold sales held by brookwood at the end of each of the three years ended december  were not material 
deferred income tax asset 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized for net operating loss and certain other tax carryforwards  tax credits and temporary differences  reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized 
management is required to 
table of contents estimate taxable income for future years and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance to reduce part or all of a deferred tax asset 
management considers various tax planning strategies  anticipated gains from the potential sale of investments and projected income from operations to determine the valuation allowance to be recorded  if any 
impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the investment  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes and the level of expected operating expenses 
impairment of investments accounted for under equity method 
investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment is believed to have fallen below the company s carrying value 
when such a decline is deemed other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to the statement of operations for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time 
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary  the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline  the investee s financial performance  and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value 
however  a decline in the quoted market price below the carrying amount or the existence of operating losses is not necessarily indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary 
all are factors to be evaluated 
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired 
at least annually  the company performs impairment reviews and determines if a writedown is required 
during the year ended december   hallwood energy recorded impairments of oil and gas properties of  the company recorded its proportionate share of such impairments through the equity method of accounting as discussed below 
principally due to the recording of these impairments  the company s carrying value of its investment in hallwood energy at december  was reduced to zero 
the company s proportionate share of hallwood energy s calendar year loss would have reduced the carrying value of its investment in hallwood energy below zero 
the general rule for recording equity losses ordinarily indicates that the investor shall discontinue applying the equity method when the investment has been reduced to zero and shall not provide for additional losses  unless the investor provides or commits to provide additional funds to the investee  has guaranteed obligations of the investee  or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the investee 
although no guarantee or commitment existed at december   the company loaned  to hallwood energy in january to provide capital to continue regular ongoing operations of hallwood energy 
accordingly  the company recorded an additional equity loss in to the extent of the  loan  as the company had not determined to what extent  if any  that it would advance additional funds to hallwood energy 
as a result of the completion of the talisman energy transaction in june  the company entered into the equity support agreement with hallwood energy which obligated the company to contribute additional equity or debt capital of  at the completion date along with  loaned in may for a total amount of  to hallwood energy and guarantee an additional amount of up to  in certain circumstances  both of which were issued under the terms of the second convertible note discussed below 
the company loaned  to hallwood energy during september pursuant to the equity support agreement 
the company s additional investments and commitment to provide additional financial support  resulted in the recording of an equity loss in of  which included accumulated equity losses that 
table of contents had not been previously recorded  as the company had reduced the carrying value of its investment to zero 
the company s carrying value of its hallwood energy investment was zero at december  the company s proportionate share of hallwood energy s accumulated losses that have not been recognized as of december  is approximately  based upon its class a limited partner ownership percentage 
in prior years  the company s evaluation of its investment in hallwood energy contained assumptions including i an evaluation of reserves using assumptions commonly used in the industry  some of which were not the same as are required by the sec to be used for financial reporting purposes  ii realization of fair value for various reserve categories based upon hallwood energy s historical experience  and iii value per acre in a potential sale transaction  based upon acreage owned in productive areas with shale characteristics similar to acreage previously sold by hec and he iii and other sale activity of acreage with shale formations 
inventories 
inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to past and future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported 
presentation the company intends the discussion of its financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding its financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect its financial statements
