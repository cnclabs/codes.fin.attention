item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in addition  certain accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
fair valuation of financial instruments the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  on january  this standard provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with the three level hierarchy eg  level  level and level established under sfas no 
fair value determination in accordance with sfas no 
requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets 
table of contents or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company ensures whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
for current broker prices obtained on certain investment securities that we believe are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in very inactive markets  we have modified our approach in determining the fair values of these securities 
we have determined that each of these securities will be individually examined for the appropriate valuation methodology based on a combination of the market approach reflecting current broker prices and a discounted cash flow approach 
in calculating the fair value derived from the income approach  the company made assumptions related to the implied rate of return  general change in market rates  estimated changes in credit quality and liquidity risk premium  specific non performance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security  as well as broker discount rates are taken into consideration in determining the discount rate 
the values resulting from each approach ie market and income approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary 
table of contents impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  an analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
as required under emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interest in securitizes financial assets  and eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
 the company considers all available information relevant to the collectibility of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making its other than temporary impairment assessment for our portfolio of residual securities and pooled trust preferred securities 
the company considers factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and chargeoff trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished good prices as well as acts of nature earthquakes  floods  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies  and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
a detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss methodology can be found in management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we continue to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio and changing credit environment 
changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should also be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report including the section entitled loans and allowance for loan losses 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or through full or partial satisfaction of loans  is considered held for sale  and is recorded at the lower of 
table of contents cost or estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure 
loan balances in excess of fair value of the real estate acquired at the date of foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed as deemed necessary by management and the real estate is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo below the carrying value are recorded through the use of a valuation allowance by charges to noninterest expense 
any subsequent operating expenses or income of such properties are charged to non interest expense 
if the reo is sold shortly after it is received in a foreclosure ie  the holding period was deemed minimal  the company substitutes the value received in the sale net of costs to sell for the fair value less costs to sell 
any adjustment made to the loss originally recognized at the time of foreclosure is then charged against or credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses  if deemed material 
otherwise  any declines in value after foreclosure are recorded as gains or losses from the sale or disposition of the real estate 
revenue recognition upon disposition of a property is dependent on the sale having met certain criteria relating to the buyer s initial investment in the property sold 
loan sales from time to time  we sell and securitize single family and multifamily loans to secondary market investors 
we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the sold or securitized loans 
the gain on sale recorded on these loans depends  in part  on our allocation of the previous carrying amount of the loans to the retained interests 
previous carrying amounts are allocated in proportion to the relative fair values of the loans sold and the interests retained 
the fair values of retained interests are estimated based upon the present value of the associated expected future cash flows taking into consideration future prepayment rates  discount rates  expected credit losses  and other factors that impact the value of the retained interests 
when mortgage loans are sold  we generally retain the right to service these loans 
we may record mortgage servicing assets  or msas  when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer 
mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value 
the company determines whether the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement 
the expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing 
in addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates  other assumptions such as the cost to service the underlying loans  foreclosure costs  ancillary income and float rates are also used in determining the value of the msas 
mortgage servicing assets are discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
goodwill impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level which is the same level as the company s four major operating segments identified in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the first part of the test is a comparison  at the reporting unit level  of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
in order to determine the fair value of the reporting units  a combined income approach and market approach was used 
under the income approach  the company provided a net income projection and a terminal growth rate was used to calculate the discounted cash 
table of contents flows and the present value of the reporting units 
under the market approach  the fair value was calculated using the current fair values of comparable peer banks of similar size  geographic footprint and focus 
the market capitalizations and multiples of these peer banks were used to calculate the market price of the company and each reporting unit 
the fair value was also subject to a control premium adjustment  which is the cost savings that a purchase of the reporting unit could achieve by eliminating duplicative costs 
under the combined income and market approach  the value from each approach was appropriately weighted to determine the fair value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated and compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill recorded within the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  then the company would recognize an impairment loss for the amount of the difference  which would be recorded as a charge against net income 
for additional information regarding goodwill  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
share based compensation we account for share based awards to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r  as required  on january  prior to  we recognized stock based compensation expense for employee share based awards based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
we grant nonqualified stock options and restricted stock 
most of our stock option and restricted stock awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting 
the stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date  while the restricted stock awards generally vest in three to five years from the date of grant 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award 
we use an option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of our stock options which is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these methods used to determine these variables are generally similar to the methods used prior to for the purposes of our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
we make assumptions regarding expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield  and risk free interest rate in determining the fair value of our stock options 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term assumption is estimated based on the stock options vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees historical exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s current dividend payout rate on its common stock 
for the risk free interest rate assumption 
table of contents is based upon the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant appropriate for the term of the employee stock options 
for restricted share awards  the grant date fair value is measured at the fair value of the company s common stock as if the restricted share was vested and issued on the date of grant 
as share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation is discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
overview proved to be one of the most challenging periods in our year history 
the downturn in the us housing markets  the volatility in the financial services industry  and continued uncertainty in the us economy have caused widespread instability on the global financial systems 
liquidity concerns and credit issues have resulted in the failure and insolvency of several large financial companies as well as the us government s conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac 
to this end  we undertook several decisive and strategic actions throughout the year to strengthen our balance sheet improving our capital and liquidity positions  fortifying our loss reserve levels  as well as stabilizing our problem loans and reducing our credit risk exposures 
additionally  we were able to reduce operating expenses despite higher credit cycle costs 
with these measures  we feel we are positioned better than ever to face the economic challenges that will likely continue to plague the financial services industry in the coming year 
in  we raised a total million in capital through the issuance of million of convertible preferred stock in april and the issuance of million of preferred equity in december as a participant in the tarp cpp 
these issuances of preferred stock have bolstered our capital ratios well above regulatory minimum as well as well capitalized thresholds for banks 
as of december   our total risk based capital ratio was or million more than the regulatory requirement for well capitalized banks 
our tier risk based capital ratio of and our tier leverage ratio of as of december  also significantly exceeded regulatory guidelines for well capitalized banks 
our tangible equity to tangible assets ratio improved to at december   compared to as of december  similarly  our liquidity position has also been considerably strengthened 
at december   we tripled our total borrowing capacity and holdings of cash and cash equivalents to billion  compared to billion at december  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately billion in available borrowing capacity from various sources including the fhlb  the frb  repurchase agreements  and federal funds facilities with several financial institutions 
during  we obtained additional borrowing capacity from the federal reserve discount window of almost million 
our combined borrowing capacity and cash holdings represent of total assets and of total deposits as of december  despite volatile and challenging market conditions  we also experienced a  or million  growth in deposits during  with total deposits increasing to billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  our continued efforts to deleverage our balance sheet have resulted in a lower loan to deposit ratio of at december   compared to at september  and at december  we believe that our liquidity position is more than sufficient to meet our operating expenses  borrowing needs and other obligations 

table of contents nonperforming assets totaled million representing of total assets at december  this compares to million or of total assets at september  and million or of total assets at december  nonperforming assets as of december  are comprised of nonaccrual loans totaling million  oreo totaling million  and loans modified or restructured amounting to million 
included in nonaccrual loans as of december  are loans totaling million which were not days past due as of december   but have been classified as nonaccrual due to concerns surrounding collateral values and future collectibility 
nonaccrual loans continued to be impacted by the deterioration in the residential construction and land portfolios  which comprised million or of total nonperforming assets 
during  we took deliberate measures to proactively identify  quantify  and reduce our exposure to problem loans 
we have ordered new appraisals for our entire portfolio of land and construction loans as well as our portfolio of commercial business and trade finance loans 
we believe that the early identification of problem loans and potential future problem loans has enabled us to begin the process of resolving credit issues with substantially less risk and ultimate losses 
additionally  during  we lowered total commitments on land and construction loans by billion  significantly reducing our overall exposure to these sectors of our loan portfolio which have been most impacted by the downturn in the real estate market 
throughout  we have also aggressively managed our problem loans through weekly meetings with senior management and lenders and through the development of individual borrower action plans to improve our credit and collateral positions 
we believe that our disciplined approach in resolving problem credits has proven to be very effective in decelerating the increase in our problem loans despite a highly challenging credit environment 
partly as a consequence of the actions that we took to identify and manage our problem loans  we recorded million in loan loss provisions during at december   our allowance for loan losses amounted to million or of total gross loans 
in comparison  the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total gross loans as of december  total net chargeoffs amounted to million during  representing of average loans during this compares to million  representing of average loans during approximately  or million  of the total net chargeoffs recorded during were related to land and residential construction loans while net chargeoffs on commercial loans amounted to million  or approximately of total chargeoffs 
these elevated chargeoff levels that we experienced during reflect the proactive actions that we took to reduce our ultimate loss exposures as we wrote down loans that we believed to be impaired in accordance with sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
despite a sizeable loss provision recorded during  our core operating earnings remained profitable during the year 
the million  or per share  net loss that we recorded during includes both million in loan loss provisions and million in otti charges on investment securities 
a large portion of the non cash otti charges  approximately million was related to preferred stock issued by fannie mae and freddie mac 
the fair values of these preferred stock securities were adversely impacted by the federal government s conservatorship of these entities in september the remaining million in otti charges recorded during were related to certain pooled trust preferred debt and equity securities 
excluding loan loss provisions and non cash otti charges on investment securities  our core pretax operating income amounted to million  or per share  during net interest income decreased to million during  compared with million our net interest margin decreased basis points to during this compares with during the same period in relative to  our net interest margin during was adversely impacted by the sharp decline in interest rates prompted by several consecutive federal 
table of contents reserve rate cuts  by the reversal of interest from nonaccrual loans  and by the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short term investments 
excluding the non cash otti charges on investment securities amounting to million  total noninterest income decreased to million during  compared with million for the corresponding period in this decrease is attributable primarily to impairment charges on mortgage servicing assets and other assets totaling million during these decreases were partially offset by higher net gain on sale of investment securities and branch related revenues earned during core noninterest income  which excludes the impact of non cash otti charges  as well as net gains on sales of investment securities  loans and other assets  remained stable at million during  compared to million during the same period last year 
total noninterest expense increased to million during  compared with million for the same period in the increase in total noninterest expense during  relative to  can be attributed predominantly to higher deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments  higher oreo expenses and higher other credit cycle related expenses 
our efficiency ratio  which represents noninterest expense excluding amortization and impairment writedowns on intangible assets and amortization of investments in affordable housing partnerships divided by the aggregate of net interest income before provision for loan losses and noninterest income  was during compared with for despite the year over year increase in noninterest expense  we focused on cost management throughout fourth quarter noninterest expenses decreased million from the third quarter  million from the second quarter  and million from the first quarter amidst rising credit cycle expense  including legal  consulting and oreo expenses 
this reduction in operating expenses during was achieved largely through net attrition and the reduction of incentives and other compensation related expenses 
total consolidated assets at december  increased to a record billion  compared with billion at december  the net increase in total assets is comprised predominantly of increases in cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  held to maturity and available for sale investment securities totaling million  deferred tax assets totaling million  and oreo  net amounting to million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net loans receivable of million and securities purchased under resale agreements amounting to million 
total liabilities increased to billion as of december   compared to billion as of december  the net increase in liabilities is primarily due to increases in total deposits of million  partially offset by decreases in federal funds purchased of million and fhlb advances of million 
total average assets increased to billion in  compared to billion in  due primarily to growth in average available for sale securities 
total average investment securities increased to billion during primarily due to billion in investment securities purchased since december  total average deposits rose during to billion  compared to billion for  with the most significant contribution coming from time deposits 
as a result of the ongoing instability in the financial services industry  we focused on products that provided assurance and protection for our customers deposits 
specifically  we promoted two deposit programs that provided our customers with enhanced  multi million dollar fdic insurance coverage on time deposits and money market accounts 
we believe these measures have served to further reinforce the already strong relationships we have with our customers 
as of december   we updated our goodwill impairment analysis to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill asset was impaired 
as a result of this updated analysis  we determined that there was no goodwill impairment at december  during the second and third quarters of 
table of contents  we recorded a combined goodwill impairment charge of thousand which represents the goodwill balance related to east west insurance services  inc this impairment writedown had no effect on our cash balances  liquidity or regulatory capital ratios 
on january   the board of directors declared first quarter dividends on our common stock and series a preferred stock 
despite our strong capital position  the board of directors authorized to reduce the common stock dividend to per share beginning with the first quarter of  as compared with the per share paid in previous quarters 
we believe the reduction in our common stock dividend payout to be both a responsible and prudent decision to preserve capital during this period of economic uncertainty

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses amounted to million for  compared to million for and million for the increase in loan loss provisions during reflects our increased chargeoff levels  our higher volume of classified and nonperforming loans caused by challenging conditions in the real estate housing market  turmoil in the financial markets  as well as recessionary pressures in the overall economic environment 
in response to the unprecedented downturn in the real estate and housing markets  we performed an extensive evaluation of our credit portfolio throughout to identify and mitigate potential losses in loan categories that were especially hard hit by current market conditions 
as part of this evaluation process  we ordered new appraisals for land  residential construction  and commercial construction loans during as well as engaged the services of an independent third party to make a current assessment of the financial strength of our borrowers

this was part of our comprehensive loan portfolio review process to quantify our credit exposure to sectors of the loan portfolio that have been especially hard hit by the downturn in the real estate market

operating segment results the company has identified four principal operating segments for purposes of management reporting retail banking  commercial lending  treasury  and residential lending 
although all four operating segments offer financial products and services  they are managed separately based on each segment s strategic focus 
while the retail banking segment focuses primarily on retail operations through the bank s branch network  certain designated branches have responsibility for generating commercial deposits and loans 
the commercial lending segment  which includes commercial real estate  primarily generates commercial loans and deposits through the efforts of commercial lending officers located in the bank s northern and southern california production offices 
the treasury department s primary focus is managing the bank s investments  liquidity  and interest rate risk  the residential lending segment is mainly responsible for the bank s portfolio of single family and multifamily residential loans 
the company s remaining centralized functions and eliminations of inter segment amounts have been aggregated and included in other 
future changes in our management structure or reporting methodologies may result in changes in the measurement of operating segment results 
results for prior periods are generally restated for comparability for changes in management structure or reporting methodologies 
during the second quarter of  we revised the allocation of certain investment securities resulting from our securitization activities 
we securitized a total of billion in single family and multifamily loans during due to a significant increase in our loan securitization activities during  we determined that it was more appropriate to reallocate investment securities  and their related income components  resulting from our securitization activities to the operating segments that originated the underlying loans to derive a more equitable allocation of profitability amongst the various operating segments 
initially  these securities were allocated to the treasury segment upon securitization 
as a result of our new profitability allocation structure  investment securities resulting from our securitization activities are being allocated to the operating segments ie  retail banking  commercial lending  and residential lending that initially originated the underlying loans 
as a result of these changes implemented during the second quarter of  we have revised the results for the prior periods to reflect our current allocation methodology between the treasury segment and the other operating segments 
for more information about our segments  including information about the underlying accounting and reporting process  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
retail banking the retail banking segment reported a pretax loss of million during  representing a decrease  as compared to the million pretax income recorded for the same period in 
table of contents the decrease in pretax income for this segment during is comprised of a or million decrease in net interest income to million  a million increase in loan loss provisions  a or million increase in noninterest expense  and a million increase in corporate overhead expense allocations 
the decrease in net interest income during is attributable largely to the steep basis point decrease in interest rates since december the increase in loan loss provisions for this segment during  relative to  was due to increased chargeoff activity  as well as higher levels of nonperforming and classified assets resulting from the downturn in the real estate housing market 
loan loss provisions are also impacted by average loan balances for each reporting segment 
corporate overhead expense allocations are based on several factors including  but not limited to net interest margin  loan and deposit volume and full time employee equivalents 
noninterest income for this segment decreased  to million for  from million recorded during the decrease in noninterest income in is primarily due to lower loan fee income resulting from a notable decrease in our consumer loan origination activities  partially offset by an increase in branch related fees  specifically service and transaction charges on deposit accounts  as a result of the dcb acquisition in august noninterest expense for this segment increased to million during  compared with million recorded during the increase in noninterest expense is primarily due to higher occupancy expenses and fdic insurance premiums  partially offset by a decrease in commercial deposit related expenses 
higher occupancy expenses are primarily due to increased expenses associated with the nine additional branch locations from the acquisition of dcb 
the increase in fdic insurance premiums is due to the recent increases in the fdic deposit assessment rate and full utilization of the one time fdic assessment credit of million  million of which was applied to reduce deposit insurance assessments in and the remaining thousand was applied in the first quarter of the decrease in commercial deposit related expenses can be correlated to lower title and escrow deposit balances during relative to title and escrow deposits have been negatively impacted by the sustained contraction in the housing market

the acquisitions of standard bank in march and dcb in august added fifteen new locations to our branch network as well as several thousand new customers to our customer base 
the increase in provision for loan losses for this segment is primarily due to increased substandard loan classifications for loans originated by this segment 
commercial lending the commercial lending segment reported a pretax loss of million during  or a decrease  compared with pretax income of million for the primary driver of the decrease in pretax income for this segment for both periods is a significant increase in loan loss provisions resulting from increased chargeoff activity as well as higher levels of nonperforming and classified assets and an increase in corporate overhead allocations  partially offset by the increase in net interest income 

table of contents net interest income for this segment increased to million during  compared to million for the increase in net interest income is primarily due to a significant decline in the charge for funds applied to the loan portfolio as a result of the declining interest rate environment 
although interest income on loans also decreased in response to declining interest rates  the interest rate floors on variable loans helped to support the interest income on these loans 
noninterest income for this segment decreased to million during  compared with million recorded in the decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to a decrease in loan fee income resulting from the downturn in the real estate market

loan loss provisions are also impacted by average loan balances for each reporting segment 
noninterest income for this segment increased to million during  compared to million recorded during the net increase in noninterest income during year to date is primarily due to higher net gain on sale of loans and higher servicing income received as a result of the bank s securitization of its residential and multifamily loan portfolios in noninterest expense for this segment increased to million during  from million during the same period in the increase in noninterest expense during is due to an increase in credit cycle related costs  as well as compensation and other operating expenses due to the restructuring and consolidation of two departments

table of contents sfas  fair value measurement  and sfas  fair value option sfas and sfas became effective on january  we adopted sfas which provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap 
this standard applies to all financial assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported at fair value on a recurring and non recurring basis 
for the company  this includes the investment securities available for sale portfolio  equity swap agreements  derivatives payable  mortgage servicing assets and impaired loans 
the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
we did not elect to adopt the fair value option as permitted under sfas  but to continue recording the financial instruments in accordance with current practice 
securities purchased under resale agreements we purchase securities under resale agreements resale agreements with terms that range from one day to several years 
total resale agreements decreased to million as of december   compared with million as of december  the decrease as of december  reflects the early termination of a million resale agreement on in january which had a stated maturity termination date of january in conjunction with the early termination of this agreement  we received million from the counterparty  which we recorded as a yield adjustment included in interest income during the first quarter of as of december   the million balance of resale agreements is comprised of one resale agreement with a term of ten years 
the interest rate is initially fixed for the first two years and thereafter becomes floating 
there is no interest payment on this agreement if certain swap yield curves are inverted 
the collateral for this resale agreement consists of us government agency and or us government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage backed securities held in safekeeping by a third party custodian 
purchases of securities under resale agreements are overcollateralized to ensure against unfavorable market price movements 
we monitor the market value of the underlying securities which collateralize the related receivable on resale agreements  including accrued interest 
in the event that the fair market value of the securities decreases below the carrying amount of the related repurchase agreement  our counterparty is required to designate an equivalent value of additional securities 
the counterparties to these agreements are nationally recognized investment banking firms that meet credit eligibility criteria and with whom a master repurchase agreement has been duly executed 
investment securities income from investing activities provides a significant portion of our total income 
we aim to maintain an investment portfolio with an adequate mix of fixed rate and adjustable rate securities with relatively short maturities to minimize overall interest rate risk 
our investment securities portfolio primarily consists of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  us government sponsored enterprise debt securities  us government sponsored and other mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  corporate debt securities  residual securities  and us government sponsored enterprise equity securities 
we classify certain investment securities as held to maturity  and accordingly  these securities are recorded based on their amortized cost 
we also classify certain investments as available for sale  and accordingly  these securities are carried at their estimated fair 
table of contents values with the corresponding changes in fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  as a component of stockholders equity 
total investment securities held to maturity totaled million at december  representing municipal securities and corporate debt securities purchased during the fourth quarter of we had no held to maturity investment securities as of december  total investment securities available for sale increased to billion as of december   compared with billion at december  the increase in investment securities was funded by deposit growth and capital raised during total repayments maturities and proceeds from sales of available for sale securities amounted to billion and million  respectively  during proceeds from repayments  maturities  sales  and redemptions were applied towards additional investment securities purchases totaling billion

at december   investment securities available for sale with a par value of billion were pledged to secure public deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  frb discount window  and for other purposes required or permitted by law 
we perform regular impairment analyses on the investment securities 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  an impairment writedown is recognized in current earnings 
other than temporary declines in fair value are assessed based on factors including the duration the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position  the severity of the decline in value  the rating of the security  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and our ability and intent on holding the securities until the fair values recover 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and ongoing review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company ensures whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
as a result of the global financial crisis and illiquidity in the us markets  we believe the current broker prices that we have obtained on our private label mortgage backed securities and pooled trust preferred debt and equity securities are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in very inactive markets that are not representative of the economic value of these securities 
the fair values of private label mortgage backed securities and pooled trust preferred securities have traditionally been based on the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers since broker quotes in an active market are given the highest priority under sfas however  in light of these circumstances  we have modified our approach in determining the fair values of these securities 
we have determined that each of these securities will be 
table of contents individually examined for the appropriate valuation methodology based on a combination of the market approach reflecting current broker prices and a discounted cash flow approach 
in calculating the fair value derived from the income approach  the company made assumptions related to the implied rate of return  general change in market rates  estimated changes in credit quality and liquidity risk premium  specific non performance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security  as well as broker discount rates are taken into consideration in determining the discount rate 
the values resulting from each approach ie market and income approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value on each private label mortgage backed and pooled trust preferred security 
the majority of unrealized losses in the available for sale portfolio at december  are related to aa and aaa rated private label mortgage backed securities that we have retained in connection with our loan securitization activities 
as of december   the fair value of these securities totaled million  representing of our total investment securities available for sale portfolio 
gross unrealized losses related to these securities amounted to million  or of the aggregate amortized cost basis of these securities as of december  these unrealized losses are caused by lack of liquidity and market spreads resulting from instability in the residential real estate and credit markets 
the underlying loans are not subprime in nature and were originated by the bank in accordance with our customary underwriting standards 
the securities are supported by overcollateralization as of december  additionally  these securities are insured by a monoline insurance provider who was recently rated as aa and aaa by two major rating agencies 
as of december   we had million in trust preferred debt securities available for sale  representing of our total investment securities available for sale portfolio 
these debt instruments had gross unrealized losses amounting to million  or of the total amortized cost bases of these securities as of december  almost all of the pooled trust preferred securities held by the company have underlying collateral issued by banks and insurance companies 
of the different trust preferred securities that we have purchased  four securities have underlying collateral issued by a combination of bank  insurance  real estate investment trusts or homebuilder companies 
furthermore  most of the trust preferred securities are overcollateralized and have subordination structures that management believes will afford sufficient principal and interest protection 
while one pooled trust preferred security was downgraded from an a rating to b during the fourth quarter of  based on our cash flow and default stress testing analysis  we believe we will be able to collect all amounts due and that this security is not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  during  one pooled trust preferred security was downgraded to a b rating  from a bbb rating by one rating agency 
during  we recorded a combined million in impairment writedowns on this downgraded security and two other trust preferred securities in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  and fsp eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
we believe that the recent bailout program passed by the us government to provide for an injection of capital reduces the risk of default by bank issuers and increases the probability that the liquidity in this market and the prices of our securities will improve in the future 
we will continue to review such factors  including but not limited to  the estimated cash flows  liquidity and credit risk  for these securities on a quarterly basis 
the company believes the cash flows are not at risk and has the ability and the intention to hold these securities until their fair values recover to cost 
as such  the company does not deem these securities to be other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the liquidity and credit concerns led the us federal government to assume a conservatorship role in fannie mae and freddie mac 
the rating on fannie mae and freddie 
table of contents mac preferred securities was downgraded from bbb to c reflecting the cessation of dividend payments on these securities 
these securities are non cumulative perpetual preferred stock in which unpaid dividends do not accumulate 
the purchase agreement between the us treasury and these government sponsored entities contains a covenant prohibiting the payment of dividends on existing preferred stock 
as the assessment on the status of any resumption in dividend payments on these securities was uncertain  in accordance with sfas  fsp fas and sfas  we recorded million in otti charges on fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock securities in as of december   the fair value of these preferred securities was million

in accordance with sfas  fsp fas and sfas eitf  and fsp eitf  we recorded million in impairment charges in related to our pooled trust preferred equity securities  which represented the remaining balance for these securities 
the impairment charges were due to the adverse changes in expected cash flows  and the high uncertainty surrounding the collectibility of these securities 
we have fifteen individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer as of december  these securities are comprised of eleven pooled trust preferred securities with a total fair value of million and four mortgage backed securities with a total fair value of million 
as of december   there were also securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
the unrealized losses on these securities are primarily attributed to changes in interest rates as well as the liquidity crisis that has impacted all financial industries 
the issuers of these securities have not  to our knowledge  established any cause for default on these securities 
these securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market interest rates have fluctuated

we sold approximately million in conforming and non conforming residential single family loans through our secondary marketing efforts during  compared to million sold in the adverse conditions in the housing market and increased credit risks have further widened credit spreads  and resulted in investors tightening their credit underwriting standards for qualifying loans 
originations of loans not eligible for government guarantees have essentially halted due to the erosion of value and lack of investor confidence in private label mortgage backed securities 
the frb recently announced plans to purchase up to billion in government sponsored entities debt and up to billion in government sponsored entities mortgage backed securities over the next few quarters 
although the lower mortgage rates should support our secondary market efforts  concerns about a weakening economy and job instability may curtail customer demand 
we offer both fixed and adjustable rate arm single family residential mortgage loan programs 
we primarily offer arm loan programs that have six month  three year  five year  or seven year initial fixed periods 
we originate single family residential mortgage loans under three different types of programs full alternative documentation  reduced documentation and no documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels 
our underwriting criteria for all the loans in our single family residential mortgage loan programs include minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores and maximum loan to value ltv ratios 
additionally  our full alternative documentation loan program 
table of contents requires verification of employment and income 
reduced documentation loans are primarily intended for borrowers who are self employed 
generally  we require reduced documentation borrowers to have more equity in the property and higher amounts of liquid reserves 
finally  our no documentation loan program is designed for borrowers who demonstrate excellent credit quality and have the ability to place a large down payment or have high equity in the property 
of the million in residential single family mortgage loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation loans  or million were reduced documentation loans and or million were no documentation loans

based on management s evaluation and analysis of the portfolio credit quality and prevailing economic conditions  we believe the loan loss provision is adequate for losses inherent in the portfolio as of december  multifamily real estate loans 
during  severe market conditions also adversely affected our new originations of multifamily loans 
we originated million multifamily loans in  as compared to million in although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
multifamily real estate loans accounted for million or  and million or  of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
we offer both fixed and adjustable rate multifamily loan programs 
we primarily offer adjustable rate multifamily loan programs that have six month  three year  or five year initial fixed periods 
prior to the latter half of  we originated multifamily mortgage loans under two different types of programs full documentation and reduced documentation 
during  all of the million in multifamily loans originated were reduced documentation loans 
in comparison  of the million in multifamily loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation and or million were reduced documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels  similar to our single family residential loan programs 
underwriting criteria generally include minimum fico scores  maximum loan to value ratios and minimum debt coverage ratios 
additionally  we own single family and multifamily residential mortgage loans that have contractual features that may increase our credit exposure 
these mortgage loans include adjustable rate mortgage loans that may subject borrowers to significant future payment increases or create the potential for negative amortization of the principal balance 
interest only mortgage loans allow interest only payments for a fixed period of time 
at the end of the interest only period  the loan payment includes principal payments and increases significantly 
the borrower s new payment once the loan becomes amortizing ie  includes principal payments will be greater than if the borrower had been making principal payments since the origination of the loan 
the longer the interest only period  the larger the amortizing payment will be when the interest only period ends 
there were million and million in interest only loans held in the bank s portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
historically  losses experienced from interest only loans have been minimal and we do not believe potential losses from these loans will be significant 

table of contents the bank has purchased adjustable rate mortgage loans which permit different repayment options 
the monthly payment for adjustable rate mortgage loans with negative amortization features is set as the initial interest rate for the first year of the loan 
after that point  the borrower can make a minimum payment that is limited to a increase in payment 
if the minimum payment is not adequate to cover the interest amount due on the mortgage loan  the loan would have negative amortization  which will result in an increase in the mortgage loans principal balance 
these loans completely re amortize every five years and the monthly payment is reset at that point 
none of the adjustable rate mortgages held in the bank s loan portfolio that have the potential to negatively amortize were negatively amortizing as of december  and we do not believe potential losses from these loans will be significant 
our total exposure related to these products in our loan portfolio for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows table nontraditional mortgage products unpaid principal balance as of december  in thousands interest only mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgages with negative amortization features residential single family loans residential multifamily loans all of the loans we originate are subject to our underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
generally  loans obtained from third party originators  including the higher risk loans in the preceding table  are closed and funded in our name and are also subject to our same underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
we believe our strict underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks which may come from these products 
we conduct a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits to ensure compliance with our origination standards  including our criteria for lending and legal requirements 
commercial real estate loans 
we continue to place emphasis in the origination of commercial real estate loans 
although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
commercial real estate loans accounted for billion or  and billion or  of our loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
since substantially all of our real estate loans are secured by properties located in california  declines in the california economy and in real estate values could have a significant effect on the collectibility of our loans and on the level of allowance for loan losses required

mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value 
the fair value of servicing assets is determined based on the present value of estimated net future cash flows related to contractually specified servicing fees 
the primary determinants of the fair value of mortgage servicing assets are prepayment speeds and discount rates 
published industry standards are used to derive market based assumptions 
changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of mortgage servicing assets 
evaluation of impairment is performed on a quarterly basis 
we record mortgage servicing assets for loans sold or securitized for which servicing has been retained by the bank 
we recorded million in msa impairment writedowns during  compared with thousand in the decline in interest rates as well as the overall increases in borrower refinancing and prepayment rates related to the underlying sold or securitized loans have caused the value of msas to decrease 
we may expect a further decline in the value of msas in the near future if interest rates continue to fall and prepayment speeds increase 
for more information about msas  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 

table of contents nonperforming assets loans are continually monitored by management and the board of directors 
generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if either i principal or interest payments are past due in excess of days  or ii the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain  regardless of the length of past due status 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  any interest accrued on the loan is reversed and charged against current income 
in general  subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans that demonstrate a satisfactory payment trend for several months are returned to full accrual status subject to management s assessment of the full collectibility of the account

under sfas no 
 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
also  in accordance with sfas no 
 loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses required for the period 
at december   the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans was million  compared with million at december  the increase in impaired loans is largely due to an increase in nonperforming residential construction loans which have been especially hard hit by current economic conditions and the downturn in the housing market 
all nonaccrual and doubtful loans are included in impaired loans 
impaired loans at december  are comprised of single family loans totaling million  multifamily loans totaling million  commercial real estate loans totaling million  construction loans totaling million  commercial business loans totaling million  trade finance loans amounting to million  sba loans totaling thousand  and automobile and other consumer loans totaling million

table of contents in light of the credit and mortgage crisis affecting the entire financial industry and its impact on our borrowers  the company has taken a more proactive approach to assess potential loan impairment in our overall portfolio 
we have expanded our scope to perform focused reviews of certain sectors of our loan portfolio to identify and mitigate potential losses 
our recent experience made us aware of the rapid deterioration occurring in the market in a relatively short period of time 
specifically  we have noted that while our borrowers may continue to pay as agreed in accordance with their contractual terms and or even though loans may not have reached a significant stage of delinquency  the existence of certain warning signs indicating possible collectibility issues warranted a more careful scrutiny of these loans for potential impairment 
specifically  we reviewed loans that exhibited the following characteristics diminishing or adverse changes in cash flows that serve as the principal source of repayment  adverse changes in the financial position or net worth of guarantors or investors  adverse changes in collateral values for collateral dependent loans  declining or adverse changes in inventory levels securing commercial business and trade finance  failure in meeting financial covenants  or other changes or conditions that may adversely impact the ultimate collectibility of loans 
although certain loans are not days or more delinquent and therefore still accruing interest  we have classified them as impaired as of december  because they exhibit one or more of the characteristics described above 
allowance for loan losses we are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
in addition to regular  quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to a continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period operating results  and is increased or decreased by the amount of net recoveries or chargeoffs  respectively  during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december  the million increase in the allowance for loan losses at december   from year end  reflects million in additional loss provisions  less million in net chargeoffs during the year 
the allowance for unfunded loan commitments  off balance sheet credit exposures  and recourse provisions is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in the off balance sheet allowance amount was due  in part  to a decline in unfunded loan commitments at december  relative to year end we recorded million in loan loss provisions during  as compared to million in loss provisions recorded during the increase in loss provisions recorded during  compared to  was brought on by the sustained downturn in the real estate market and continued instability in the overall economy

table of contents market conditions will continue to remain challenging in and we expect to record additional loan loss provisions during the first quarter of the following table summarizes activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated table allowance for loan losses at or for the year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance balance  beginning of year allowance from acquisitions allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit provision for loan losses gross chargeoffs residential single family multifamily real estate commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business trade finance automobile other consumer total gross chargeoffs gross recoveries residential single family residential multifamily commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business trade finance automobile other consumer total gross recoveries net chargeoffs recoveries allowance balance  end of year average loans outstanding total gross loans outstanding  end of year net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans allowance for loan losses to total gross loans at end of year our methodology to determine the overall appropriateness of the allowance is based on a classification migration model and qualitative considerations 
the technique of migration analysis essentially looks at pools of loans having similar characteristics and analyzes their loss rates over a historical period 
we utilize a loss horizon of seventeen years to better capture the bank s historical loss trends 
this loss horizon represents the timeframe when the bank started to monitor and track losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
since loss rates derived by the migration model are based predominantly on historical loss trends  they may not be indicative of the actual or inherent loss potential for loan categories that have little or no historical losses 
as such  we utilize qualitative and environmental factors as adjusting mechanisms to supplement the historical results of the classification migration model 

table of contents qualitative considerations include  but are not limited to  prevailing economic or market conditions  relative risk profiles of various loan segments  the strength or deficiency of the internal control environment  volume concentrations  growth trends  delinquency and nonaccrual status  problem loan trends  and geographic concentrations 
qualitative and environmental factors are reflected as percent adjustments and are added to the historical loss rates derived from the classified asset migration model to determine the appropriate allowance amount for each loan category 
in consideration of the significant growth and increasing diversity and credit risk profiles of loans in our portfolio over the past several years  our classification migration model utilizes sixteen risk rated or heterogeneous loan pool categories and three homogeneous loan categories 
the loan sectors included in the heterogeneous loan pools are residential single family  residential multifamily  commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  trade finance  and automobile loans 
with the exception of automobile loans  all other heterogeneous loan categories have been broken down into additional subcategories 
for example  the commercial real estate loan category is further segmented into six subcategories based on industry sector 
these subcategories include retail  office  industrial  land  hotel motel  and other special purpose or miscellaneous 
by sectionalizing these broad loan categories into smaller subgroups  we are better able to isolate and identify the risks associated with each subgroup based on historical loss trends 
in addition to the sixteen heterogeneous loan categories  our classification migration model also utilizes three homogeneous loan categories which encompass predominantly consumer related credits 
specifically  these homogeneous loan categories are home equity lines  overdraft protection lines  and credit card loans 
the following table reflects the company s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated 
table allowance for loan losses by loan category at december  amount amount dollars in thousands residential single family residential multifamily commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business trade finance automobile consumer and other total the increase of million in the allowance for loan at december   relative to year end  was primarily due to increased loss estimates and historic losses for individual loan categories 
except for trade finance loans  loss reserves on all loan categories increased  reflecting the downturn in the residential real estate market and deteriorating conditions in the overall economy 
loss reserves for construction and land loans included in commercial and industrial real estate increased significantly from december   reflecting the sharp decline in values experienced in 
table of contents these portfolios 
the decrease in loss reserves on trade finance loans is in line with the contraction of this portfolio since year end deposits we offer a wide variety of deposit account products to both consumer and commercial customers 
total deposits increased million to billion at december   as compared to billion at december  net deposit growth was comprised of increases in money market accounts of million or  and time deposits of million or 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in noninterest bearing demand accounts of million or  interest bearing checking accounts of million or  and savings accounts of million or  during the year

additionally  during the third quarter of  we partnered with another financial institution to implement a new retail sweep product for non time deposit accounts to provide added deposit insurance coverage for deposits in excess of fdic insured limits  deposits gathered through these programs are considered brokered deposits under current regulatory reporting guidelines 
public deposits decreased to million at december   from million at december  a large portion of these public funds are comprised of deposits from the state of california 
the decrease in public deposits is due to lack of available funds from funding sources

the interest rates on these customer repurchase agreements ranged from to as of december  all of the other repurchase agreements are long term with ten year maturity terms 
repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold 
the collateral for these agreements consist of us government agency and us government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage backed securities 
all of these repurchase agreements have an original term of ten years 
the rates were generally initially floating rate for a period of time ranging from six months to three years  with the floating interest rates ranging from the three month libor minus basis points to the three month libor minus basis points 
with the exception of one repurchase agreement  the rates have been switched to fixed rates for the remainder of the term  with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
the counterparty has the right to either a one time call or a quarterly call when the rates change from floating to fixed  for each of the repurchase agreements 
long term debt long term debt remained at million at december  and long term debt is comprised of subordinated debt which qualifies as tier ii capital and junior subordinated debt issued in connection with our various trust preferred securities offerings which qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in the course of our business  we may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet and are considered to be off balance sheet arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements whereby an unconsolidated entity is a party  under which we have any obligation under a guarantee contract  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 

table of contents loan securitizations and sales in the ordinary course of business  the company sells loans with or without recourse 
for loans sold with recourse  the recourse component is considered a guarantee 
in certain situations  the company could also have an obligation for loans sold without recourse 
additional information pertaining to our loan sales is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
from time to time  we securitize certain real estate loans  a portion of which are sold to investors 
securitizations provide us with a source of liquidity and also reduce our credit exposure to borrowers 
securitizations involve the sale of loans to a qualifying special purpose entity  or qspe  typically a trust 
in a securitization  we transfer financial assets to a qspe that is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  which are secured by future collections on the sold loans 
the qspe sells securities to investors  which entitle them to receive specified cash flows during the term of the securities 
the qspe uses proceeds from the sale of these securities to pay the purchase price for the sold loans 
the proceeds from the issuance of the securities are then distributed to the company as consideration for the loans transferred 
when we sell or securitize loans  we generally retain the right to service the loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the securitized assets 
retained interests may provide credit enhancement to the investors and represent the company s maximum risk exposure associated with these transactions 
investors in the securities issued by the qspe have no further recourse against the company if cash flows generated by the securitized assets are inadequate to service the obligations of the qspe 
additional information pertaining to our securitization transactions and related retained interests is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
commitments as a financial service provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to customers  such as loan commitments  commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade  standby letters of credit  and financial guarantees 
many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
the same credit policies are used in extending these commitments as in extending loan facilities to customers

according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i and total capital ratios meet or exceed and  respectively  are deemed to be well capitalized 
at december   the bank s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  the following table compares east west bancorp  inc s and east west bank s actual capital ratios at december   to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes table regulatory required ratios east west bancorp east west bank minimum regulatory requirements well capitalized requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco  and issuances of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
in addition  government programs  such as the fdic s tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary uses of funds include 
table of contents withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash inflows from operating activities reflects the million loan loss provision recorded during net cash inflows from operating activities during and were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled million  million  and billion during   and  respectively 
net cash outflows from investing activities for were due primarily to purchases of short term investments  investment securities  and loans receivable 
these factors were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment securities and loans  the early termination of a resale agreement  as well as repayments  maturities and redemptions of investment securities 
for and  net cash outflows from investing activities can be attributed primarily to the growth in our loan portfolio and purchases of available for sale securities 
these activities were partially offset by repayments  maturities  redemptions and net sales proceeds from investment securities 
we experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of million during the year ended december   primarily due to million net proceeds received from the issuance of series a and series b preferred stock during april and december  respectively  as well as the net increase in deposits 
as a result of the turbulence in the banking sector  we experienced a notable growth in deposit products that afford greater deposit insurance coverage to deposit customers during the second half of as of december   time deposits within the cdars program increased to million  compared to million at december  the cdars program allows customers with deposits in excess of fdic insured limits to obtain full coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the cdars program 
additionally  during the third quarter of  we partnered with another financial institution to implement a new retail sweep product for non time deposit accounts to provide added deposit insurance coverage for deposits in excess of fdic insured limits 
cash from financing activities were partially offset by net decreases in federal funds purchased and fhlb advances  as well as million of existing cash and cash equivalents to pay cash dividends to our stockholders 
during  proceeds from federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  and long term debt accounted for net cash inflows from financing activities totaling million 
these factors were partially offset by a net decrease in deposits  purchases of treasury shares related to our board approved share repurchase program  and dividends paid on common stock 
during  net cash inflows from financing activities amounting to billion were due to net increases in repurchase agreements  fhlb advances  deposits  federal funds purchased  and long term debt 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank s discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various correspondent banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
during  we obtained additional borrowing capacity from the federal reserve discount window of almost million by pledging construction and commercial business loans 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our day to day cash flow requirements 
at december   we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
as of december   we are not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 

table of contents the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
for the years ended december  and  total dividends paid by the bank to east west bancorp  inc amounted to million and million  respectively 
the large increase in dividend payments by the bank to the company during is primarily due to share repurchases totaling million in connection with the board authorized stock repurchase program announced during as of december   approximately million of undivided profits of the bank were available for dividends to the company 
on january   the board of directors declared first quarter dividends on the company s common stock and series a preferred stock 
despite the company s strong capital position  the board of directors authorized the reduction of the common stock dividend to per share for the first quarter of  compared with the per share paid in previous quarters 
as a result of the uncertain economic environment  the company believes it was a prudent and responsible decision to reduce the dividend payout and preserve capital at this time 
interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
although in the normal course of business we manage other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  we consider interest rate risk to be among the more significant market risks and could potentially have material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a quarterly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest 
table of contents income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a non parallel shift of and basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income volatility net portfolio value volatility change in interest rates basis points december  december  december  december  the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to the published indices 
the following table provides the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments 

table of contents table expected maturity for financial instruments expected maturity or repricing date by year after total fair value at december  dollars in thousands assets cd investments average yield fixed rate short term investments weighted average rate securities purchased under resale agreements weighted average rate investment securities held to maturity fixed rate weighted average rate investment securities held to maturity variable rate weighted average rate investment securities available for sale fixed rate weighted average rate investment securities available for sale variable rate weighted average rate total gross loans weighted average rate liabilities checking accounts weighted average rate money market accounts weighted average rate savings deposits weighted average rate time deposits weighted average rate federal funds purchased weighted average rate fhlb advances term weighted average rate customer repurchase agreements weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements fixed rate weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements variable rate weighted average rate subordinated debt weighted average rate junior subordinated debt fixed rate weighted average rate junior subordinated debt variable rate weighted average rate includes hybrid securities that have fixed interest rates for the first three or five years 
thereafter  interest rates become adjustable based on a predetermined index 
expected maturities of assets are contractual maturities adjusted for projected payment based on contractual amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal as well as repricing frequency 
expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates for deposits with no stated maturity dates 
we utilize assumptions supported by documented analyses for the expected maturities of our loans and repricing of our deposits 
we also use prepayment projections for amortizing securities 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary significantly if future prepayments and repricing frequencies differ from our expectations based on historical experience 
the fair values of short term investments approximate their book values due to their short maturities 
for securities purchased under resale agreements  fair values are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has reviewed the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
for private label mortgage backed securities and pooled trust preferred securities  fair values are derived based on a combination of broker prices and discounted 
table of contents cash flow analyses that are weighted as deemed appropriate for each security 
the fair value of loans is determined based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the associated yield curve plus spreads  and reflects the offering rates in the market for loans with similar financial characteristics 
the fair value of deposits is determined based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the associated yield curve  plus spread  if any 
for core deposits  the cash outflows are projected by the decay rate based on the bank s core deposit premium study 
cash flows for all non time deposits are discounted using the libor yield curve 
for time deposits  the cash flows are based on the contractual runoff and are discounted by the bank s current offering rates  plus spread 
for federal funds purchased  fair value approximates book value due to their short maturities 
the fair value of fhlb term advances is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next repricing date based on current rates offered by the fhlb for borrowings with similar maturities 
customer repurchase agreements  which have maturities ranging from one to three days  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interests rates paid on these instruments are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair values of securities sold under repurchase agreements are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates  utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
for both subordinated and junior subordinated debt instruments  fair values are estimated by discounting cash flows through maturity based on current market rates the bank would pay for new issuances 
the asset liability committee is authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
we may elect to use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
currently  derivative instruments do not have material effect on our operating results or financial position 
in august and november  we entered into four equity swap agreements with a major investment brokerage firm to hedge against market fluctuations in a promotional equity index certificate of deposit product that we offered to bank customers for a limited time during the latter half of this product  which has a term of years  pays interest based on the performance of the hang seng china enterprises index  or the hscei 
as of december   the combined notional amounts of the equity swap agreements total million with termination dates similar to the stated maturity date on the underlying certificate of deposit host contracts 
for the equity swap agreements  we agreed to pay interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis and receive any increase in the hscei at swap termination date 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  a certificate of deposit that pays interest based on changes in an equity index is a hybrid instrument with an embedded derivative ie  equity call option that must be accounted for separately from the host contract ie  the certificate of deposit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 both the embedded equity call options on the certificates of deposit and the freestanding equity swap agreements are marked to market every month with resulting changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
on april   the company amended the four equity swap agreements entered into in effectively removing the swap payable leg 
the amendments to the swap agreements changed the terms of the agreements such that instead of paying interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis for the remaining terms of the agreements  we prepaid this amount based on the current market value of the cash streams 
the total amount paid in conjunction with these swap agreement amendments was million on april  
table of contents in december  the company entered into two additional equity swap agreements with a major investment brokerage firm to hedge against market fluctuations in a promotional equity index certificate of deposit product offered to bank customers 
this product  which has a term of years  also pays interest based on the performance of the hscei similar to the previous index certificate offering in as of december   the combined notional amounts of these new equity swap agreements totaled million and have termination dates similar to the stated maturities of the underlying certificate of deposit host contracts 
on december   we prepaid million for the option cost based on the current market value of the cash streams 
the fair values of the equity swap agreements and embedded derivative liability for these six derivative contracts amounted to million and million  respectively  as of december   compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the decrease in the fair value of the derivative contracts since december  can be attributed to a decline in the index value as of december   relative to year end the embedded derivative liability is included in interest bearing deposits and the equity swap agreements are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the derivative contracts is determined based on the change in value of the hscei and the volatility of the call option over the life of the individual swap agreement 
the option value is derived based on the volatility  the interest rate and the time remaining to maturity of the call option 
the company has also considered the counterparty s as well as its own credit risk in determining the valuation
