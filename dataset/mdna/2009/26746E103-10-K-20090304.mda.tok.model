item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on inflammatory and oncology indications 
we use our proprietary drug discovery technology  known as phage display  to identify antibody  small protein and peptide compounds for clinical development 
this phage display technology fuels our internal pipeline of promising drug candidates  attracts numerous licensees and collaborators  and has the potential to generate important revenues in the future 
our lead product candidate  dx  is a small recombinant protein that is a highly specific inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein 
we and our collaborators are currently developing dx in multiple indications 
the most advanced indication for dx is in the treatment of hae  a potentially life threatening inflammatory condition 
dx has orphan drug designation in the united states and eu  as well as fast track designation in the united states for the treatment of acute attacks of hae 
in this indication  we have completed three phase trials and two phase trials of dx for subcutaneous administration 
on september   we submitted a bla with the united states fda for the use of dx for the treatment of acute attacks of hae and the fda has designated this application for priority review 
on february   the fda s pulmonary allergy advisory committee voted in favor of approval of dx for hae 
the committee s findings will be weighed by the fda in determining whether our bla for dx is to be approved 
if the bla is approved  we intend to market and sell dx on our own in north america 
we are currently negotiating with potential partners to commercialize dx for hae and other angioedema indications in markets outside of north america 
outside of hae  dx is also being developed in additional indications 
these include ace inhibitor induced angioedema  a life threatening inflammatory response brought on by adverse reactions to ace inhibitors  acquired angioedema  a condition associated with b cell lymphoma and autoimmune disorders  the use of dx for the prevention of blood loss during surgery  and the use of dx for the treatment of retinal diseases 
we have completed a phase trial of dx for the prevention of blood loss during on pump cabg procedures 
in april  we entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with cubist  for the development and commercialization in north america and europe of the intravenous formulation of dx for the prevention of blood loss during surgery 
under this agreement  cubist assumed responsibility for all further development and costs associated with the use of dx in this indication in the cubist territory 
cubist has announced plans to conduct two additional phase trials  a dose ranging  placebo controlled trial in low risk patients undergoing primary cabg or valve replacement surgery  and a trial to study the safety and efficacy of a single dose of dx compared with tranexamic acid in patients who have a higher risk of bleeding 
we have entered into a license agreement with fovea for the ocular formulation of dx for the treatment of retinal diseases in the eu 
under this agreement  fovea will fully fund development for the first indication  retinal vein occlusion induced macular edema  for which an ind application is expected in dyax retains all rights to commercialize dx in this indication outside of the eu 
in addition to dx  we have identified two product candidates for preclinical development  dx and dx  two fully human monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential in oncology indications 
in february  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with sanofi aventis under 
table of contents which they will be responsible for the continued development of dx dx is currently in preclinical development and is being evaluated for testing in a range of oncology indications 
all of the compounds in our pipeline were discovered using our proprietary phage display technology  which allows us to rapidly identify product candidates that bind with high affinity and specificity to therapeutic targets 
although we use this technology primarily to advance our own internal development activities  we also leverage it through licenses and collaborations designed to generate revenues and provide us access to co develop and or co promote drug candidates identified by other biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
through our lfrp  we have agreements with more than licensees and collaborators  which have thus far resulted in product candidates that licensed third parties have advanced into clinical trials and one product that has received market approval from the fda 
a portion of the current and future revenues generated through the lfrp are pledged to secure payment of a loan we received from cowen healthcare in august we incurred losses in and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years 
we do not expect to generate profits until the therapeutic products from our development portfolio reach the market after being subjected to the uncertainties of the regulatory approval process 
clinical development programs dx for hae 
we are developing dx as a treatment for hae 
the clinical development of dx for hae is summarized as follows in march  we completed a patient  multi center  open label  single dose  dose escalating phase study  known as edema in may  we completed a patient  multi center  placebo controlled  single dose  dose escalating phase study  known as edema in january  we completed a attack patient  multi center  open label  repeat dosing phase study  known as edema in november  we completed a patient  multi center  phase study  known as edema  which was conducted at sites in the united states  europe  canada and israel 
the primary objective of the edema trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of our fixed mg subcutaneous dose of dx for patients suffering from moderate to severe acute hae attacks 
the edema trial was comprised of two phases a double blind  placebo controlled phase and a repeat dosing phase 
in the first phase  hae patients received either a single dose of dx or placebo 
after patients received one treatment in the placebo controlled portion of the study  they were eligible for the second phase where they received repeat dosing with dx for any subsequent acute attacks 
drug versus placebo showed statistical significance in primary and secondary endpoints for the edema trial in june  we completed a second phase study  known as edema the trial was a patient  multi center study conducted at sites in the united states and canada 
the trial was conducted as a double blind  placebo controlled study in which hae patients received a single mg subcutaneous dose of dx or placebo 
this trial  conducted under a special protocol assessment spa  was intended to further support the validity of the patient reported outcome methodology used in the edema trial and to further assess the efficacy and safety of dx primary and secondary endpoints for the edema trial were met with statistical significance 
an on going  open label continuation study is also being conducted to augment our clinical data with respect to dx 
table of contents our study results in patients exposed to multiple doses of dx suggest that it can provide repeated therapeutic benefit to hae patients for all types of hae attacks  including potentially fatal laryngeal attacks 
furthermore  there is no apparent decrease in dx s therapeutic effects on hae attacks in these patients 
to date  dx is generally well tolerated  with the most serious risks being hypersensitivity reactions  including anaphylaxis  which are resolved with treatment 
other adverse events include headache  nausea and fatigue 
based on the positive safety and efficacy results from our edema and edema trials  we submitted our bla to the fda on september  the fda accepted our bla for filing and has designated the application for priority review 
the fda s pulmonary allergy drugs advisory committee reviewed our submission for the subcutaneous formulation of dx for hae on february   and the committee voted in favor of approval of dx for hae by a margin of six votes in favor to five votes against  with two voters abstaining 
in addition to the overall vote in favor of approval  the committee provided recommendations aimed to better understand dx s safety characteristics in the subset of patients that experience hypersensitivity reactions 
we are currently in the process of discussing the elements of a safe use program with the fda 
given our familiarity with the hae market and its relatively small number of treating allergists  we intend to independently commercialize dx in north america 
for markets outside of north america  we will seek to establish arrangements where dx is sold by pharmaceutical companies that we already well established in these regions 
because regulatory approvals for new pharmaceutical products can be  and often are  significantly delayed or refused for numerous reasons  dx may not be approved on the timeline we expect  or at all 
the following table illustrates the activity associated with dx for hae included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss years ended december  in thousands dx for hae costs dx drug substance manufacturing costs total research and development expenses for dx for hae research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net dx for hae program costs during  the total research and development expenses on this program totaled million compared with million in and million in the increase in spending from to is attributable to increased clinical costs for our edema phase trial  as well as an increase in personnel expenses required to support the advancement of the hae program  and was partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs related to the process validation campaign completed in dx for hae research and development expenses increased million in over because of increased preclinical costs for additional toxicology studies  increased clinical costs for the close out of the edema trial and start up costs for the edema trial  and an increase in personnel expenses 
dyax genzyme llc was responsible for the reimbursement of all development expenses related to the hae program until the termination of the llc on february  this reimbursement was 
table of contents recorded as research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
during  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us million for our expenses relating to the program 
for  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us for million for our expenses through the date of the termination 
dyax genzyme llc had net losses representing the total research and development expenses incurred by dyax and genzyme on dx for hae 
our portion of the losses  accounted for under the equity method  were million and million for the years ended december   and respectively  and were proportional to our financial interest in the program prior to the collaboration s termination 
our portion of the losses is separately classified as equity loss in joint venture on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
all expenditures on the program after february  became the sole responsibility of dyax and are included in research and development expense on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
dx for the treatment of other angioedemas another form of angioedema is induced by the use of so called ace inhibitors 
with an estimated to million prescriptions written annually worldwide  ace inhibitors are widely prescribed to reduce angiotensin converting enzyme ace and generally reduce high blood pressure and vascular constriction 
approximately of all angioedemas admitted to medical centers for treatment are identified as ace inhibitor induced angioedema 
research suggests the use of ace inhibitors increases the relative activity of bradykinin  a protein that causes blood vessels to enlarge  or dilate  which can also cause the swelling known as angioedema 
as a specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein  an enzyme needed to produce bradykinin  dx has the potential to be effective for treating this condition 
the company is working with investigators affiliated with the university of cincinnati as they prepare to initiate an investigator sponsored study for drug induced angioedema 
acquired angioedema is a condition associated with b cell lymphoma and autoimmune disorders 
dr 
marco cicardi  of the university of milan  plans to sponsor a compassionate use study of dx with these forms of acquired angioedema  which study will be conducted at three sites in italy during dx for on pump cts industry publications report that there are an estimated one million procedures performed worldwide each year involving on pump cardiothoracic surgery  or cts 
on pump cts procedures  which are performed for patients who have narrowings or blockages of the coronary arteries  often involve use of a heart lung machine commonly referred to as the pump 
in these procedures  the heart is stopped with medications  and the pump does the work of the heart and lungs during surgery 
this allows the surgeon to position the heart as needed  to accurately identify the arteries and to perform the bypass while the heart is stationary 
the use of the pump during cts procedures elicits an adverse systemic inflammatory response 
many patients undergoing on pump cts procedures experience significant intraoperative blood loss that requires transfusion 
plasma kallikrein has been implicated in the body s response to on pump heart surgery as a major contributor to the significant blood loss seen in on pump cts patients and to the pathologic inflammation that plays a role in the complications of on pump cts procedures 
in april   dyax entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with cubist for the development and commercialization in north america and europe of the intravenous formulation of dx for the prevention of blood loss during surgery 
under this agreement  cubist assumed responsibility for all further development and costs associated with dx in the licensed indications in the cubist territory 

table of contents having determined that the existing experience from a phase clinical trial of dx sponsored by dyax kalahari was sufficient to help with the design of a subsequent dose ranging trial  cubist closed the kalahari study in june based on the top line results from the kalahari trial  cubist is planning two additional phase trials 
they have completed plans to initiate a dose ranging  placebo controlled trial in low risk patients undergoing cabg surgery and are working towards initiating a trial to study the safety and efficacy of a single dose of dx compared with tranexamic acid in patients who have a higher risk of bleeding 
based on the final protocols for these two trials  cubist expects to enroll a total of approximately patients 
during  research and development expenses for the cts program totaled million compared to million in during  we billed cubist million for reimbursement of services related to the phase kalahari trial incurred in no future expenditures are expected to be incurred by us for this program 
goals for clinical development programs our goal for the ongoing clinical development program for dx is to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international regulatory agencies 
cash inflows for either of these programs  other than upfront and milestone payments from any collaboration we may enter into  will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product candidate finds acceptance in the marketplace as a treatment for its disease indication 
because of the many risks and uncertainties related to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when cash inflows from these programs will commence  if ever 
other discovery and development programs in addition to our drug candidates in clinical trials  our phage display technology and expertise has allowed us to develop a pipeline of drug candidates 
our goal is to maintain at least ten ongoing therapeutic programs in our pipeline at all times 
of our existing pipeline candidates  the most advanced are dx and dx  two fully human monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential in oncology indications 
our dx antibody has a novel mechanism of action that targets the tie receptor on tumor blood vessels 
in preclinical animal models  dx has demonstrated activity against a broad range of solid tumor types 
data also indicates increased activity when combined with antiangiogenic therapies such as avastin and nexavar 
in february  we entered into agreements with sanofi aventis  under which we granted sanofi aventis exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize dx as a therapeutic product  as well as a non exclusive license to our proprietary antibody phage display technology 
our dx antibody is a specific inhibitor of mmp on tumor cells and tumor blood vessels 
to date  small molecule approaches have failed to produce compounds that distinguish between closely related mmps 
in contrast  our technology has allowed us to identify a highly selective inhibitor of mmp that does not inhibit other proteases that we have tested 
in animal models  dx has been shown to significantly inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in a dose dependent manner in breast  prostate  pancreatic and melanoma tumors 
herceptin  a leading breast cancer treatment  is effective in only the subtype of breast tumors which are her 
current data suggests that dx may be effective against both her and her breast tumors  potentially offering promise for treatment of a wider range of breast cancer patients 
dx is currently in preclinical development and is being evaluated for testing in a range of oncology indications 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence if we will be able to enter into additional partnerships or otherwise internally develop any of 
table of contents these other preclinical drug candidates into marketable pharmaceutical products 
we monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and frequently evaluate our pre clinical pipeline in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
results of operations revenues 
substantially all our revenue has come from licensing  funded research and development fees  including milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
this revenue fluctuates from year to year due to the timing of the clinical activities of our collaborators and licensees 
total revenue for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million in revenue from to reflects revenue of million associated with our agreement with sanofi aventis  million from our agreement with cubist  and a million increase in library license fees primarily due to new agreements and milestones in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in patent license activity due to revenue in including million recognized from a fully paid up license agreement signed with morphosys 
the increase of million in revenue from to was primarily related to the recognition of million from the license agreement with morphosys and a million increase in revenue from library license agreements 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue associated with our former dx product collaboration  which concluded in research and development 
our research and development expenses are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc net research and development expenses equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss research and development expenses adjusted to include equity loss in joint venture our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and related costs for personnel dedicated to research and development activities and for the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside parties to conduct research  clinical trials and to manufacture drug material prior to fda approval 
while expenses we incur on the dx program for hae are included in our research and development expenses  expenses through february  were reimbursed by the dyax genzyme llc joint venture and excluded from net research and development expenses 
as we jointly funded the losses of that program with genzyme  our equity loss in joint venture represents our share of all expenses for the development of dx for hae through february  by 
table of contents dyax genzyme llc 
subsequent to the termination of the joint venture on february   there has been no reimbursement from genzyme nor any equity loss in the joint venture 
research and development expense increased by million in compared to  excluding dx for hae reimbursements by the joint venture and equity loss in joint venture 
this includes a million decrease associated with the closure of our liege operations 
development costs for dx clinical candidates increased million due to increases in internal costs  clinical trial costs and a decrease in manufacturing 
third party license fees associated with lfrp and licensing increased million in other development costs for preclinical candidates increased approximately million in primarily related to an increase in personnel expenses 
of the million increase in research and development expenses from to  million is attributable to dx for hae costs due to increases in clinical trial costs  personnel costs  additional preclinical toxicology studies  and increased manufacturing costs related to drug product validation studies 
the additional  increase in research and development expenses is attributable to an increase in clinical trial costs for dx in the on pump cts program  offset by a decrease in preclinical and small scale manufacturing costs associated with preclinical candidates 
combining net research and development expenses and equity loss in joint venture  our adjusted net research and development expenses increased million from to due primarily to million increase in hae program costs and a decrease in reimbursement by the dyax genzyme llc joint venture 
the offsetting decrease in our equity loss in joint venture reflects the termination of the joint venture in february our management believes that the above presentation of adjusted net research and development expenses  although a non gaap measure  provides investors a better understanding of how total research and development efforts affected our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in prior year periods 
our presentation of this measure  however  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees  market research and promotion activities and the reporting requirements of a public company 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase from to was primarily due to increased infrastructure to support our planned commercialization of dx for hae in north america 
the increase from to was due to increased share based compensation expense  recruiting fees and other personnel costs 
restructuring and impairment 
in  we incurred restructuring fees of million and recorded an impairment charge related to fixed assets of  in connection with the closing of our liege based research facility 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in  we incurred a one time loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to fully paying off our debt with paul royalty 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease from to is primarily due to a decrease in interest by repaying our loan with paul royalty in august and replacing it with a lower interest loan with cowen healthcare 
interest on the paul royalty agreement was calculated using the effective interest method based on our expected future payments to paul royalty
