risk factors 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our business involves making significant estimates and assumptions in the normal course of business relating to our contracts due to  among other things  different project scopes and specifications  the long term duration of our contract cycle and the type of contract utilized 
therefore  management believes that revenue recognition is the most important and critical accounting policy 
the most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the estimating of total forecasted construction contract revenues  costs and profits in accordance with accounting for long term contracts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could be material 
our estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed 
we believe  based on our experience  that our current systems of management and accounting controls allow management to produce reliable estimates of total contract revenue and cost during any accounting period 
however  many factors can and do change during a contract performance period  which can result in a change to contract profitability from one financial reporting period to another 
some of the factors that can adversely change the estimate of total contract revenue  cost and profit include differing site conditions to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the failure of major material suppliers to deliver on time  the failure of subcontractors to perform as agreed  unusual weather conditions  our failure to achieve expected productivity and efficient use of labor and equipment and the inaccuracies of our original bid estimate 
because we have a large number of contracts in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without affecting overall profitability 
however  significant changes in cost estimates on larger  more complex projects can have a material impact on our financial statements and are reflected in our results of operations when they become known 
when recording revenue from change orders on contracts that have been approved as to scope but not price  we include in revenue an amount equal to the amount that we currently expect to recover from customers in relation to costs incurred by us for changes in contract specifications or designs  or other unanticipated additional costs 
revenue relating to change order claims is recognized only if it is probable that the revenue will be realized 
when determining the likelihood of eventual recovery  we consider such factors as evaluation of entitlement  settlements reached to date and our experience with the customer 
when new facts become known  an adjustment to the estimated recovery is made and reflected in the current period results 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the majority of our contracts with our customers are fixed unit price 
under such contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or per cubic yard of earth excavated 
to minimize increases in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors 
after we are advised that our bid is the winning bid  we enter into firm contracts with most of our materials suppliers and sub contractors  thereby mitigating the risk of future price variations affecting those contract costs 
such quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we therefore have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
as a result  we have rarely been exposed to material price or availability risk on contracts in our contract backlog 
assuming performance by our suppliers and subcontractors  the principal remaining risks under our fixed price contracts relate to labor and equipment costs and productivity levels 
most of our state and municipal contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner  with provisions to pay us only for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred  and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to finish uncompleted contracts 
our cost estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach  and we believe our experience allows us to produce reliable estimates 
however  our contracts can be highly complex  and in almost every case  the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a large number of contracts of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in revenue or cost estimates can have a significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with scope changes  extended overhead due to customer related and weather related delays  subcontractor and supplier performance issues  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the contract and changes in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors  as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods  and these fluctuations may be significant 
valuation of long term assets 
long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
in addition  we had goodwill with a carrying amount of approximately million at december   which must be reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas the impairment testing required by sfas requires considerable judgment  and an impairment charge may be required in the future 
we completed our annual impairment review for goodwill during the fourth quarter of  and it did not result in an impairment 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  where necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
reflecting management s assessment of expected future operating profitability and expectation that the company would utilize all remaining net operating loss carry forwards nols  we eliminated our valuation allowance in we are subject to the alternative minimum tax amt 
when we utilize our nols to offset taxable income  payment of amt results in a reduction of our deferred tax liability 
our deferred tax assets related to our nols for financial statement purposes were fully utilized during in addition to the utilization of those nols  we had available to us the excess tax benefit resulting from exercise of a significant number of non qualified in the money options amounting to million  which we expect to utilize in the preparation of our federal income tax return 
accordingly  because we will no longer have the significant offsets provided by the nols  a comparison of our future cash flows to our historic cash flows may not be meaningful 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 fin which establishes the criteria that an individual tax position must meet for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recorded 
adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations 
in august  our board of directors authorized management to sell our distribution business 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we determined in the third quarter of that the distribution business became a long lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation 
in october  we sold the distribution business to an industry related buyer for gross proceeds of approximately million 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale in of approximately  equal to  after taxes

revenues increased million  or  from to a majority of the increase was due to the revenues earned by our nevada operations  acquired on october   which were included in the consolidated results of operations for the full year of versus only two months in the remainder of the increase in revenues is the result of an increase in work performed by our texas operations as a result of better weather throughout than management estimates that revenues would have been to million greater had our houston operations not been interrupted by hurricane ike and its after effects in september  additionally  one of our oil suppliers in nevada filed for bankruptcy in july and failed to furnish contracted oil for our production of asphalt on two of our jobs in progress  which delayed job performance and deferred approximately million of revenue into the company has negotiated with ndot and does not anticipate the profitability on these contracts will be materially impacted by this matter 
contract receivables are directly related to revenues and include both amounts currently due and retainage 
the increase of million in contracts receivable to million at december  versus is due to the increase in revenue for the year the days revenue in contract receivables is approximately days and days at december  and  respectively 
the days revenue in contract receivables would have been similar for the two years if the revenues of our nevada operations had been included in our revenues for a full year in revenue in the fourth quarter of increased million to million versus for the same reasons as discussed above for the full year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly financial information 

table of contents gross profit gross profit increased million in over this was due to the contribution of our nevada operations in and better weather in texas during most of than during other than for the period during hurricane ike  which allowed our crews and equipment to be more productive 
while hurricane ike affected our work in  a hurricane usually does not adversely affect our profitability as much as the consistent rainy periods we had in our gross margin decreased in from because of operating inefficiencies on certain contracts in texas  higher fuel costs and lower profit margins on certain contracts started in the last half of we expect the trend of lower profit margins on contracts awards to continue at least in the first half of gross profit in the fourth quarter of decreased million or from the same quarter in gross profit was of revenues in the fourth quarter versus in the fourth quarter of as a result of some unusually profitable municipal projects being performed primarily in the fourth quarter 
without those projects  the gross margins for the fourth quarter would have been more in line with normal margins  although still somewhat better than that of the fourth quarter of contract backlog at december   our backlog of construction projects was million  as compared to million at december  we were awarded approximately million of new projects and change orders and recognized million of earned revenue in approximately million of the backlog at december  is expected to be completed after the decrease in backlog from was due to increased competition and economic conditions in certain of our markets 
while our business does not include residential and commercial infrastructure work  the severe fall off in new projects in those markets in nevada and to a lesser extent in texas  has caused a softer bidding climate in our infrastructure markets and has caused some residential and commercial infrastructure contractors to bid on public sector transportation and water infrastructure projects  thus increasing competition and creating downward pressure on bid prices in our markets 
these and other factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our backlog through successful bids for new projects and could adversely affect the profitability of new projects that we do obtain through successful bids 
recent reductions in miles driven in the us and more fuel efficient vehicles are reducing federal and state gasoline taxes and tolls collected 
additionally  the current credit crisis may limit the amount of state and local bonds that can be sold at reasonable terms 
further  the nationwide decline in home sales  the increase in foreclosures and a prolonged recession may result in decreases in user fees and property and sales taxes 
these and other factors could adversely affect transportation and water infrastructure capital expenditures in our markets 
general and administrative expenses  and other income general and administrative expenses  net  increased by million in from primarily due to a full year of g a at our nevada operations offset by lower stock compensation expense 
despite the increase in absolute g a expenses  the percentage of g a to revenue decreased to in from in as the nevada operations g a is not as large a percentage of revenues as sterling s g a which includes corporate overhead and expenses associated with being a public company 
other income decreased million and consists of gains and losses on disposal of equipment which depends on  among other things  age and condition of equipment disposed of  insurance recoveries and the market for used equipment 
operating income operating income increased million due to the factors discussed above regarding gross profit and general and administrative expenses and other income 

table of contents interest income and expense net interest income was million less for than due to a decrease in interest rates on cash and short term investments combined with the imputed interest expense of million on the put option related to the minority interest in rhb 
income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is due to the portion of earnings of a subsidiary taxed to the minority interest owner partially offset by the revised texas franchise tax which became effective july  minority interest in subsidiary the increase of million is due to the minority interest s share of the results of rhb included in the consolidated results of operations for a full year in versus two months in fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december

revenues increased million  or  from to reflecting the effect of continued expansion of our construction fleet  addition of a concrete plant and addition of crews 
our workforce grew by year over year  and we purchased over million in property  plant and equipment  including that acquired in the purchase of rhb  within the twelve month period ending december  the increased revenue came strictly from the state market resulting from the company being the successful low bidder in the state market which was assisted by an improved bidding climate in due to a large state highway program and increased total funding in the dallas and houston areas 
the improvement in the weather in the fourth quarter offset much of the lower than expected revenue of the first three quarters of due to heavy rainfall during those months 
due to seasonality of the nevada market  the contracts of rhb had only a modest effect on revenues for the two months they were included in revenues 

table of contents contract receivables are directly related to revenues and include both amounts currently due and retainage 
the increase of million in contracts receivable to million at december  versus is due to the increase in revenue for the year the days revenue in contract receivables is approximately days and days at december  and  respectively 
the increase in days revenue in contract receivables is primarily the result of the nevada operations receivables at december  gross profit 
the improvement in gross profits in was due principally to the increase in revenues 
the slight margin reduction was attributable to a decrease of margin in backlog due to poor weather for the first three quarters of the year  and an increase in sales from the state contracts which have historically had lower gross than municipal contracts 
state highway contracts generally allow us to achieve greater revenue and gross profit production from our equipment and work crews  although on average the gross margins on this work tend to be slightly lower than on our water infrastructure contracts in the municipal markets 
the lower margins reflect proportionally larger material inputs in the state contracts as we typically receive lower margins on materials than on labor 
partially offsetting the margin reduction was our ability to continue to redesign some jobs  achieve incentive awards and maintain good execution levels during dry weather 
due to the large number of contracts in different stages of completion and in different locations  it is not practical to quantify the impact of each of these matters on revenues and gross profit 
contract backlog 
the increase in contract backlog is related to the nevada acquisition in there was million included in our year end backlog on which we were the apparent low bidder and have subsequently been officially awarded these contracts 
historically  subsequent non awards of such low bids have not materially affected our backlog or financial condition 
general and administrative expenses  net of other income and expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  or g a  in was principally due to higher employee expenses  including an increase in staff  and higher professional fees 
despite these increases in g a expenses in support of our growing business  our ratio of g a expenses to revenue remained essentially unchanged from to  at 
operating income 
the increase in operating income resulted principally from the higher revenues and gross profits as discussed above 
interest income and expense 
the interest income net of interest expense remained virtually unchanged from to given the high cash and short term investments maintained throughout the year and the offering completed in december a total of  of interest expense was capitalized as part of our office and shop expansion 
income taxes 
income taxes increased due to increased income  the texas margin tax and an increase in the statutory tax rate 
minority interest 
as discussed in part i  item business  on october   the company acquired a interest in rhb 
the minority interest s share of rhb s income before income taxes was  for the two months ended december  that was included in the consolidated results of operations 
net income from continuing operations 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was the result of the various factors discussed above 
discontinued operations  net of tax 
discontinued operations for represents the results of operations of our distribution business  which was operated by steel city products  llc 
the distribution business was sold on october  the company recorded proceeds from the sale of approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately  and recorded  in income tax expense related to that gain in 
table of contents historical cash flows the following table sets forth information about our cash flows for the years ended december   and year ended december  amounts in thousands cash and cash equivalents at end of period net cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations operating activities investing activities financing activities supplementary information capital expenditures working capital at end of period operating activities significant non cash items included in operating activities are depreciation and amortization  which for totaled million  an increase of million from and million from  as a result of the continued increase in the size of our construction fleet in recent years and a full year s depreciation on equipment purchased in the rhb acquisition on october   deferred tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  mainly attributable to accelerated depreciation methods used on equipment for tax purposes and amortization for tax return purposes of goodwill arising in the acquisition of rhb 
besides net income of million and the non cash items discussed above  other significant components of cash flows from operations are as follows contracts receivable increased by million in the current year due to the increase in revenues of million  including those of the nevada operations  as compared to an increase of million in which was also due to an increase in revenue and a higher level of customer retentions  the increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of million as of december   versus a decrease of million as of december   which was due to an increase in the volume of materials purchased for certain projects at december   but not billed to the customer until and timing of other billings 
accounts payable decreased by million in and increased million in as a result of changes in the volume of materials and sub contractor services purchased in later months of each period 

table of contents investing activities expenditures for the replacement of certain equipment and to expand our construction fleet and office and shop facilities totaled million in  compared with a total of million of property and equipment purchases in capital equipment is acquired as needed to support work crews required by increased backlog and to replace retiring equipment 
the decrease in capital expenditures in was principally due to management s cautious view regarding certain of the company s markets in and current economic uncertainties 
unless such factors change  management expects capital expenditures in to be equal to or less than in during the twelve months ended december   the company had purchases of short term securities of million versus a net reduction of million in primarily due to the longer term of the securities purchased 
in october  we purchased a equity interest in rhb which we acquired for a net cash purchase price of million in order to expand our construction operations to nevada 
financing activities financing activities in primarily reflect a reduction of million in borrowings under our million credit facility as compared to an increase of million of borrowings in the amount of borrowings under the credit facility is based on the company s expectations of working capital requirements 
additionally  the company sold common stock in and for net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
liquidity the level of working capital required for our construction business varies due to fluctuations in customer receivables and contract retentions  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings  the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors 
some of these fluctuations can be significant 
as of december   we had working capital of million  an increase of million over december  increasing working capital is an important element in expanding our bonding capacity  which enables us to bid on larger and longer lived projects 
the increase in working capital was mainly the result of net income plus depreciation and deferred tax expense totaling million reduced by purchases of property and equipment of million and net repayment of debt of million 
the company believes that it has sufficient liquid financial resources  including the unused portion of its credit facility  to fund its requirements for the next twelve months of operations  including its bonding requirements  and expects no other material changes in its liquidity 
sources of capital in addition to our available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments balances and cash provided by operations  we use borrowings under our credit facility with comerica bank to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the financial markets have recently experienced substantial volatility as a result of disruptions in the credit markets 
however  to date we have not experienced any difficulty in borrowing under our credit facility or any change in its terms 

table of contents we have a million credit facility with a bank syndicate for which comerica bank is a participant and agent 
the credit facility entered into on october  replaced a similar million revolver that had been renewed in april the credit facility has a maturity date of october   and is secured by all assets of the company  other than proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts which are pledged to our bond surety 
borrowings under the credit facility were used to finance the rhb acquisition  repay indebtedness outstanding under the revolver  and finance working capital 
at december   the aggregate borrowings outstanding under the credit facility were million  and the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility was million  which reduces availability under the credit facility 
availability under the credit facility was  therefore  million 
the credit facility is subject to our compliance with certain covenants  including financial covenants relating to fixed charges  leverage  tangible net worth  asset coverage and consolidated net losses 
the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make distributions and dividends  incur liens and encumbrances  incur further indebtedness  guarantee obligations  dispose of a material portion of assets or merge with a third party  incur negative income for two consecutive quarters 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  the unpaid principal balance of each prime based loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to comerica s prime rate plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
if we achieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable prime margins will be  or  respectively 
the interest rate on funds borrowed under this revolver during the year ended december  ranged from to 
management believes that the new credit facility will provide adequate funding for the company s working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements  including seasonal fluctuations at least through december  at our election  the loans under the new credit facility bear interest at either a libor based interest rate or a prime based interest rate 
the unpaid principal balance of each libor based loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus an amount ranging from to depending on the pricing leverage ratio that we achieve 
the pricing leverage ratio is determined by the ratio of our average total debt  less cash and cash equivalents  to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda that we achieve on a rolling four quarter basis 
the pricing leverage ratio is measured quarterly 
if we achieve a pricing leverage ratio of a less than to  b equal to or greater than to but less than to  or c greater than or equal to to  then the applicable libor margins will be  or  respectively 
interest on libor based loans is payable at the end of the relevant libor interest period  which must be one  two  three or six months 
the new credit facility is subject to our compliance with certain covenants  including financial covenants relating to fixed charges  leverage  tangible net worth  asset coverage and consolidated net losses 

table of contents mortgages in we completed the construction of a new headquarters building on land owned by us adjacent to our equipment repair facility in houston 
the building was financed principally through an additional mortgage of million on the land and facilities at a floating interest rate which at december  was per annum  repayable over years 
uses of capital contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our fixed  non cancelable obligations at december  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years amounts in thousands credit facility operating leases mortgages our obligations for interest are not included in the table above as these amounts vary according to the levels of debt outstanding at any time 
interest on our credit facility is paid monthly and fluctuates with the balances outstanding during the year  as well as with fluctuations in interest rates 
in interest on the credit facility was approximately  the mortgages are expected to have future annual interest expense payments of approximately  in less than one year   in one to three years   in four to five years and  for all years thereafter 
to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts  we generally obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
as is customary in the construction business  we are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and reputation and certain external factors  including the overall capacity of the surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future  or being available only at a significantly greater cost 
we have pledged all proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety to the surety company 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures during were million  and during were million including property  plant and equipment acquired with the purchase of rhb 
in we expect that our capital expenditure spending will be equal to or less than the level due to management s cautious view regarding certain of the company s markets and current economic uncertainties
