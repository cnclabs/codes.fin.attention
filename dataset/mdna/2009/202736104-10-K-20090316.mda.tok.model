in addition  while we have not experienced a major increase in loan losses during the current economic climate  a continuation of the recent turbulence in significant portions of the global financial markets  particularly if it worsens  could impact our performance  both directly by affecting our revenues and the value of our assets and liabilities  and indirectly by affecting our counterparties and the economy generally 
dramatic declines in the housing market in the past year have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions in the united states 
concerns about the stability of the us financial markets generally have reduced the availability of funding to certain financial institutions  leading to a tightening of credit  reduction of business activity  and increased market volatility 
there can be no assurance that the eesa or the actions taken by the us treasury thereunder will stabilize the us financial system or alleviate the industry or economic factors that may adversely affect our business 
in addition  our business and financial performance could be impacted as the financial industry restructures in the current environment  both by changes in the creditworthiness and performance of our counterparties and by changes in the competitive landscape 

table of contents recent market developments the condition of the residential real estate marketplace and the us economy in and has had a significant impact on the financial services industry as a whole  and specifically on the financial results of the company 
beginning with a pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market in early that was led by problems in the sub prime mortgage market  the deterioration of residential real estate values and higher delinquencies and charge offs of loans continued throughout the drop in real estate values negatively impacted residential real estate builder and developer businesses 
the stress consumers experienced from depreciating home prices  rising unemployment  underemployment and tighter credit conditions resulted in a higher level of bankruptcy filings during the year 
with the us economy in recession in  financial institutions were facing higher credit losses from distressed real estate values and borrower defaults  resulting in reduced capital levels 
in addition  investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate were reflecting substantial unrealized losses due to a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses 
some financial institutions were forced into liquidation or were merged with stronger institutions as losses increased and the amounts of available funding and capital levels lessened 
the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  two government sponsored entities  were placed in conservatorship in september by the us government 
the federal reserve also lowered its federal funds target rate six times during  from at the beginning of the year to a range of 
at december  in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury was given the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the secretary of the department of the treasury announced that the department of the treasury will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under the program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp capital purchase program  from the billion authorized by the eesa  the treasury made billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury received  from participating financial institutions  warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions are required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp capital purchase program 
on november   the company applied for the maximum funds available through the tarp capital purchase program which was approximately million or three percent of our risk weighted assets 
if the company is approved  the board will consider the benefits of participating and will decide if we should pursue the transaction and participate 
on november   the board of directors of the fdic adopted a final rule relating to the tlg program 
the tlg program was announced by the fdic on october   preceded by the determination of systemic risk by the secretary of the department of treasury after consultation with the president  as an initiative to counter the system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
the goal of the tlg program is to reduce the cost of bank funding so that bank lending to consumers and businesses will normalize 
the tlg program is industry funded and does not rely on the dif to achieve its goals 
the tlg program consists of two components i a temporary guarantee  through the earlier of maturity or june   of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october   and before june   which on february  the us treasury  as part of the financial stability plan  extended the tlg program to october   and ii temporary full fdic deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts  now accounts paying less than interest per annum and interest on lawyers trust accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions through december  coverage under the tlg program was available for the first days without charge 
the fee assessment for coverage of senior unsecured debt ranges from basis points to basis points per annum  depending on the initial maturity of the debt 
the fee assessment for deposit insurance coverage is basis points per quarter on amounts in covered accounts exceeding  on december   the company elected to participate in both guarantee programs 

table of contents results of operations and financial condition commonwealth bankshares  inc and subsidiaries overview management views as one of the most challenging periods in our year history 
the historical challenges facing the financial markets today are like none we have ever seen before 
while we are not immune to the historic challenges facing the financial markets  we remain a well capitalized and sound company 
has brought uncertainty in the economy with the current recession  a slowdown in the housing market  declining real estate values  increased foreclosures and severe turbulence in the financial sector 
we are seeing unparalleled events in the current economy and believe there are good reasons to take precautionary and extraordinary actions now 
based on this we have taken a proactive and conservative approach by increasing our provision for loan losses to provide an additional level of reserve for loan losses that could be anticipated in a recessionary environment 
for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was million  an increase of million over the comparable period in this unprecedented action was taken in direct response to current market conditions and the deteriorating economic environment 
asset quality remains a top priority for our company and we will maintain our underwriting standards which have always been very stringent 
we are committed to working with our customers and will continue to do so during this downturn in the market

over the past three years  we have made a substantial investment in our future 
the company presently has no further plans for branch expansion 
during  management will concentrate its efforts on increasing the profitability of these branches by increasing our core deposits and thereby reducing our reliance on other borrowings 
the anticipated growth in these core deposits provides a low cost and stable source of funding 
also in  management will concentrate efforts on reducing non performing assets  monitoring the loan portfolio  maintaining existing relationships  seeking opportunities that will enhance profitability and tempering overall growth 
our strong capital position and solid foundation will be a pillar of strength as we manage through this unprecedented economic climate

in  total dividends paid to its shareholders equaled per share up from per share paid in dividends paid in were up from the per share paid in the company s key performance measures are down in comparison to prior years as a result of the current economic conditions  but the company believes they are not reflective of our company s solid foundation and are down primarily due to the significant increase in the provision for loan losses

significant categories of earning assets are loans and investment securities  while deposits and short term borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
the level of net interest income is impacted primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates when compared to previous periods of operations 
table presents the average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities  the average yields earned on such assets on a tax equivalent basis and rates paid on such liabilities  and the net interest margin for the indicated periods

net interest margin is an indicator of the company s effectiveness in generating income from its earning assets 
the net interest margin is affected by the structure of the balance sheet as well as by competition and the economy 
the spread that can be earned between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is also dependent to a large extent on the slope of the yield curve 
during  the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate times or basis points up to 
between the third quarter of and december   the federal reserve decreased the federal funds rate by basis points and have established a target range of for the federal funds rate

in addition  the competiveness for deposits resulting from the reduction in liquidity throughout the financial markets has kept rates at a high level relative to loan rates 
a shift in the mix of funding sources was also a factor in the decline in the net interest margin 
time deposits  a higher cost funding source  made up of the total interest bearing liabilities in compared to in the comparable period in as of december   the net interest margin of represented a decrease of basis points over the net interest margin of recorded in as a result of the strong growth in average loans and decreased interest rates  the yield on our interest earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december  the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities increased basis points in contributing to the increase was the strong competition for local deposits  which lead to increased rates on deposits accounts 
as of december   approximately of the loan portfolio consisted of variable rate loans which can be repriced with prime within one year  down from as of december  in a rising interest rate environment of the variable loans will reprice  having a positive impact on interest income

credit risk arises through the extension of loans  leases  certain securities and financial guarantees 
to manage this risk  the company establishes policies and procedures to manage both on and off balance sheet risk and communicates and monitors the application of these policies and procedures throughout the company 
the company s credit risk is centered in its loan portfolio 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the annual cost of maintaining an allowance for inherent credit losses 
the amount of the provision each year and the level of the allowance are matters of judgment and are impacted by many factors  including actual credit losses during the period  the prospective view of credit losses  loan performance measures and trends such as delinquencies and charge offs  the economic environment and other factors  both internal and external that may affect the quality and future loss experience of the credit portfolio 
the company continuously reviews its loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
in addition to the review of credit quality through an ongoing credit review process and a monthly review of impaired loans by management and the board  the company constructs a comprehensive allowance analysis for its loan portfolio at least quarterly 
this analysis includes three basic elements  a general allowance  specific allowances for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance representing estimations done pursuant to either standard of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
such qualitative factors management considers are the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  including adverse circumstances that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay interest and or principal  the estimated value of collateral  an analysis of the levels and trends of delinquencies  level of concentrations and growth within the portfolio  and the level and trend of interest rates and the condition of the national and local economies 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
management s evaluation and resulting provision and allowance decisions are reviewed by the board of directors quarterly

the housing downturn and the financial market disruptions that began in the second half of have continued to affect the economy and the financial services sector in the housing downturn and the broader economic slowdown accelerated during the second half of and negatively impacted the credit quality of both our consumer and commercial portfolios 
the depth and breadth of the downturn as well as the resulting impacts on the credit quality of our portfolios remain unclear 
however  we expect continued market turbulence and economic uncertainty to continue well into this uncertainty could potentially lead to additional provisions for loan losses in future periods 
as a result of the historical challenges facing the financial markets today  the company made provisions for loan losses of million in compared to million in  million in and and million in net charge offs in were million compared to thousand in  thousand in  thousand in and million in this represents of average loans outstanding in  in  in and and in the contribution to the provision and the related increase in the allowance in was made in response to current market conditions  the current economic climate and the overall growth in total loans of

although the company experienced an increase in charge offs in from  historical losses remain low 
the company has only charged off million in loans or of average loans outstanding over the past years 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  compared with million at december   million at december   million at december  and million at december  this represented of year end loans at december  compared with of year end loans at december   of year end loans at december   of year end loans at december  and of year end loans at december  based on current expectations relative to portfolio characteristics and management s comprehensive allowance analysis  management considers the level of the allowance to be adequate as of december

notwithstanding these allocations  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb charge offs in any category of loan 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses december  in thousands construction and development commercial commercial mortgage residential mortgage installment loans to individuals other unallocated total allowance for loan losses non performing assets non performing assets consist of loans accounted for on a non accrual basis as judgmentally determined by management based upon anticipated realization of interest income  loans which are contractually past due days and other real estate owned 
it is management s practice to cease accruing interest on loans when payments are days delinquent 
however  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued interest  and the loan is in the process of collection 
the following table presents information concerning non performing assets for the periods indicated 
table non performing assets december  in thousands non accrual loans construction and development commercial commercial mortgage residential mortgage installment loans to individuals other loans contractually past due days or more construction and development commercial commercial mortgage residential mortgage installment loans to individuals other total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets 
table of contents non performing assets were million or of total assets at december  compared to million or at december  non performing loans increased million during the twelve months ended december  to million 
non performing loans at december  consist of ninety nine loans 
the increase was reflective of the impact of the weak housing market and slowing economy 
million or of total non performing loans consist of seventy loans which are secured by real estate  of which million are construction and development loans 
included in the category of construction and development are condominium projects totaling million and residential lot loans of million 
the company has developed a loan impairment committee to monitor non performing assets  past due loans  identify potential problem credits and develop action plans to work through these loans as promptly as possible 
as all non performing loans are deemed impaired  the committee has individually reviewed the underlying collateral value less cost to sell on each of these loans as a part of its analysis of impaired loans 
as a result of this comprehensive analysis  million in specific reserves for loan losses has been established for non performing loans 
based on current collateral values  we believe our reserve is adequate to cover any short falls resulting from the sale of the underlying collateral 
based on current accounting and regulatory guidelines the company has provided a reserve based on current market values for these impaired loans however  management plans to work with our customers to get through these unprecedented economic times and to minimize any potential credit exposure 
management has taken a proactive approach to monitoring these loans and will continue to actively manage these credits to minimize losses 
non accrual loans at december  totaled million compared to million at december  if all non accrual loans had been performing fully  these loans would have contributed an additional million to interest income in  thousand in  thousand in  thousand in and thousand in other real estate owned at december  was million  compared to thousand at december   none at  and the balance at december  was comprised of nine properties of which eight were residential 
all properties are being actively marketed and management does not anticipate any material losses associated with these properties 
during the twelve months ended december   there were three oreo properties sold resulting in a net loss of thousand 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a loss of thousand due to a valuation adjustment on one oreo other real estate owned property in its consolidated statement of operations 
asset quality remains a top priority for the company 
we continue to allocate significant resources to the expedient disposition and collection of non performing and other lower quality assets 
uses of funds total average earning assets at december  increased from year end compared with s increase of from year end s increase of 
the increase in average earning assets over the last three years has been primarily attributable to the increase in the loan portfolio which has increased from million in to billion in loan portfolio the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets and accounts for the greatest portion of total interest income 
as of december   total gross loans excluding unearned income  grew to billion  a million or a increase from million at year end this is a continuation of the growth experienced from year end to year end of million or and from year end to year end of million or 
the growth experienced during the past three years was achieved not only by the high loan demand generated by the low interest rate environment  the presence in new markets as a result of our branch expansion  but also by the efforts of the company s officers to develop new loan relationships combined with the support of existing customers 
during  the company raised million in additional capital allowing us to continue our strong growth momentum and allowing us to better serve our customers by increasing our legal lending limit to over million as of december  during the past three years  a considerable volume of new loan relationships have been developed with old line and well established local businesses  who have transferred their relationships to the company from other regional financial institutions that are experiencing further consolidation 
this has been an excellent source of new business for the bank  as customers still value the personal attention traditionally offered by a community bank 
the company s overall objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to minimize the adverse impact of any single event or set of occurrences 
to achieve this objective  the company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type  industry concentration  geographic distribution and borrower concentration 
we continue to refine our credit standards to meet the changing economic environment 
we have adjusted our underwriting criteria  increased the frequency of portfolio monitoring in certain high risk segments of the portfolio  increased our efforts in managing the credit exposure when we begin to see signs of deterioration  as well as enhanced our collection strategies in an attempt to mitigate losses 
senior level management is devoted to the management and or collection of certain non performing assets as well as certain performing loans 
furthermore  the company has reallocated resources and staff to accomplish the aforementioned initiatives 

table of contents the table below classifies gross loans by major category and percentage distribution of gross loans at december for each of the past five years 
table loans by classification december  dollars in thousands amount amount amount amount amount construction and development commercial commercial mortgage residential mortgage installment loans to individuals other total gross loans loans held for sale total construction and development loans increased million to million in compared to an increase of million to million in and a million increase to million in the company makes loans primarily for the construction of one to four family residences and  to a lesser extent  multi family dwellings 
the company also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects  generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the company 
the amounts  interest rates and terms for construction loans vary  depending upon market conditions  the size and complexity of the project  and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors of the loan 
the term for the company s typical construction loan ranges from nine months to months for the construction of an individual residence  and from months to a maximum of three years for larger residential or commercial projects 
the company does not typically amortize its construction loans  and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
the interest rates on the company s construction loans are mostly variable 
the company does not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis 
for residential builder loans  the company limits the number of models and or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions  the builder s financial strength and track record and other factors 
construction loans for nonresidential projects and multi unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the company than residential mortgage loans 
the company attempts to minimize such risks by i making construction loans in accordance with the company s underwriting standards and to established customers in its primary market area and ii by monitoring the quality  progress and cost of construction 
loans in the commercial category  as well as commercial real estate mortgages  consist primarily of short term five year or less final maturity or five year rate call and or floating or adjustable rate commercial loans made to small to medium sized companies 
total commercial loans increased to million in compared with an increase of to million in and an increase of to million in virtually all of the company s commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans relate to property in our market areas of hampton roads and northeastern north carolina which includes the cities of norfolk  virginia beach  chesapeake  portsmouth and suffolk  virginia and the outer banks of north carolina 
as such  they are subject to risks relating to the general economic conditions in those markets  and the market for real estate in particular 
these regions experienced solid economic activity during beginning the second half of and continuing into  the economy in general declined into a recession 
although our local economy has not experienced the same dramatic decline seen in other regions in the us  our region experienced a significant downturn in real estate values 
in response to the downturn  the company has strengthened our underwriting practices and has become selective in seeking new loans and relationships 
residential mortgage loans increased million or in  compared to an increase of million or in  and an increase of million or to million in the company s one to four family residential real estate loans are generally not the typical purchase money first mortgage loan or refinancing  but are loans made for other purposes and the collateral obtained is a first deed of trust on the residential property of the borrower 
the underlying loan would have a final maturity much shorter than the typical first mortgage and may be a variable or fixed rate loan 
consumer installment loans decreased million or in  representing of total gross loans at december  consumer installment loans represented and of total gross loans as of december  and  respectively 
as of december    and  the company did not have any loans held for sale 
included in total loans as of december  were million in loans classified as held for sale 
these loans were pre committed for sale prior to funding and were secured by first deeds of trust on residential one to four family dwellings 
to limit credit exposure  the company obtains collateral to support credit extensions and commitments when deemed necessary 
the most significant categories of collateral are real and personal property  cash on deposit and marketable securities 
the company obtains real property as security for some loans that are made on the basis of the general creditworthiness of the borrower and whose proceeds were not used for real estate related purposes 
a number of measures have been taken by the company over the past several years to reduce overall exposure and earnings vulnerability in the real estate sectors of the bank s trade area 
these measures include strengthening real estate underwriting  management review of policies and practices  and reducing higher risk concentrations within the real estate portfolio 

table of contents the following table shows the maturity or period of re pricing of gross loans outstanding as of december  demand loans  as well as loans having no stated schedule of repayments and no stated maturity are reported as due within one year 
adjustable and floating rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in which they contractually mature

the ratio of noninterest expense to average total assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost associated with handling our substantial asset and liability growth resulted in increases to almost every component of noninterest expense 
a key measure of overhead is the operating efficiency ratio 
the operating efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by net bank revenue on a tax equivalent basis 
efficiency gains can be achieved by controlling costs and generating more diverse and higher levels of noninterest revenues along with increasing our margins 
the company s efficiency ratio tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december   compared to in and in salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of noninterest expense  decreased by in following an increase of in and in the decrease in salaries and employee benefits was the result of a reversal of accrued expenses for the based incentive payments

these ratios are calculated using regulatory capital either tier or total capital as the numerator and both on and off balance sheet risk weighted assets as the denominator 
tier capital consists primarily of common equity less goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
total capital adds certain qualifying debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses to tier capital 
one of four risk weights  primarily based on credit risk  is applied to both on and off balance sheet assets to determine the asset denominator 
in order to maintain a strong equity capital position and to protect against the risks of loss in the investment and loan portfolios and on other assets  management will continue to monitor the bank s capital position 
several measures have been or will be employed to maintain the bank s capital position  including but not limited to continuing its efforts to return all non performing assets to performing status  monitoring the bank s growth  and continued utilization of its formal asset liability policy

liquidity bank liquidity is a measure of the ability to generate and maintain sufficient cash flows to fund operations and to meet financial obligations to depositors and borrowers promptly and in a cost effective manner 
asset liquidity is provided primarily by maturing loans and investments  and by cash received from operations 
other sources of asset liquidity include readily marketable assets  especially short term investments  and long term investment securities that can serve as collateral for borrowings 
on the liability side  liquidity is affected by the timing of maturing liabilities and the ability to generate new deposits or borrowings as needed

table of contents million 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets  and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  including the use of broker certificates of deposit  management believes that the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositor s requirements and to meet customers credit needs 
the company s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for formulating liquidity strategies  monitoring performance based on established objectives and approving new liquidity initiatives 
alco s overall objective is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity needs  the interest rate and economic outlook  market opportunities and customer requirements 
general strategies to accomplish this objective include maintaining a strong balance sheet  achieving solid core deposit growth  taking on manageable interest rate risk and adhering to conservative financial management on a daily basis 
these strategies are monitored regularly by alco and reviewed periodically with the board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations to meet the financing needs of customers  the company is a party  in the normal course of business  to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commitments to sell loans and standby letters of credit

the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non banking companies since virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
in particular  interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes is directly related to price level indices 
accordingly  management believes the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling net increases in noninterest income and expenses 
critical accounting policies certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting policy relates to the company s allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company s borrowers to make required loan payments 
if the financial condition of the company s borrowers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the company s estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
further discussion of the estimates used in determining the allowance for loan losses is contained in note to consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is exposure to interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
based on the nature of the company s operations  it is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the hampton roads and northeastern north carolina areas  including the cities of norfolk  virginia beach  chesapeake  portsmouth and suffolk  virginia and the outer banks of north carolina and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with these local economies 
as of december   the company does not have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps or caps 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management strategy is to optimize net interest income while limiting exposure to fluctuations caused by changes in the interest rate environment 
the company s ability to manage its interest rate risk depends generally on the company s ability to match the maturities and re pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income 
the company s management  guided by the alco  determines the overall magnitude of interest sensitivity risk and then formulates policies governing asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these decisions are based on management s expectations regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the national and regional economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
the company uses a variety of traditional and on balance sheet tools to manage its interest rate risk 
gap analysis  which monitors the gap between interest sensitive assets and liabilities  is one such tool 
in addition  the company uses simulation modeling to forecast future balance sheet and income statement behavior 
by studying the effects on net interest income of rising  stable and falling interest rate scenarios  the company can position itself to take advantage of anticipated interest rate movements  and protect itself from unanticipated interest rate movements  by understanding the dynamic nature of its balance sheet components 

table of contents earnings simulation analysis management uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis  such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends  peer analysis and management s outlook 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are reflected in the different rate scenarios 
many factors affect the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes on financial instruments 
consequently  variations should be expected from the projections resulting from the controlled conditions of the simulation analysis 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on net interest income for the company for the twelve months following each of the two year ends and  using different rate scenarios change in prime rate change in net interest income change in net interest income basis points basis points basis points basis points market value simulation market value simulation is used to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments 
market values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the net market value is the market value of all assets minus the market value of all liabilities 
the change in net market value over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term interest rate risk in the balance sheet 
similar assumptions are used in the market value simulation as in the earnings simulation 
the following table reflects the change in net market value over different rate environments change in prime rate change in net market value change in net market value basis points basis points basis points basis points
