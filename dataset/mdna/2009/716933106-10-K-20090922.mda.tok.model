company overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for the treatment of immune mediated disease and cancer 
our purpose is to create a profitable company by generating income from products we develop  license and commercialize  either with one or several potential collaborators partners or alone as may best forward the economic interest of our stakeholders 
we endeavor to create novel  patentable  differentiated products that have the potential to significantly improve the standard of care in the markets we serve 
presently  we have four product candidates in clinical development and two product candidates in pre clinical development 
it is our business strategy to establish collaborations with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the purpose of generating present and future income in exchange for adding to their product pipelines 
in addition  we strive to generate collaborations that allow us to retain valuable territorial rights and simultaneously fast forward the clinical development and commercialization of our products 
it is our intention to identify product candidates based on exceptional scientific and development expertise  develop them in a rapid  cost effective manner  and then seek development and or commercialization partners 
we are committed to high standards of ethics  scientific rigor  and operational efficiency as we move each of these programs to viable commercialization 
to date  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not anticipate the generation of any product commercial revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to launch one of our products 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june  have an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as regulatory and marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products  or partner collaborations  generate sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our achieving profitability depends upon our ability  to successfully complete the development of our products  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products 
pci is an orally bioavailable histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor that is currently in multiple clinical trials  including a phase i trial in patients with advanced solid tumors and a phase i ii trial in patients with recurrent lymphomas  with a planned phase i ii trial in sarcoma in combination with doxorubicin scheduled to commence before the end of calendar year pci targets histone deacetylase hdac enzymes and inhibits their function 
we have shown that pci works by multiple mechanisms including re expression of tumor suppressors  inhibition of cell cycle and increase in reactive oxygen species  which contribute to tumor cell cytotoxicity 
previous clinical trials have demonstrated that pci has favorable pharmacokinetic properties when dosed orally  and inhibits the target enzmyes at physiological doses 
clinical responses have been recorded in the three single agent clinical trials to date  with two partial responses and nine stable diseases in fifteen evaluated patients in lymphoma and ten stable diseases in solid tumors 
pci has demonstrated a very good safety profile in over patients treated so far  with the main dose limiting toxicity observed being reversible thrombocytopenia 
thrombocytopenia reduced platelet count has been observed with a number of hdac inhibitors and is thought to be related to the pharmacologic mechanism of action 
in the case of pci  the thrombocytopenia is being successfully managed using novel dose scheduling strategies that we have developed and tested in the clinic 
in preclinical models  we have identified synergy of pci with several approved cancer therapeutics  and some of these combinations will be tested in the clinic  including the sarcoma trial due to begin before the end of calendar year this trial will also test the novel biomarker rad that we have developed in collaboration with scientists at stanford university  which may be useful as predictive biomarker in clinical testing by improving patient selection 
we are also continuing the development of our first in class hdac selective inhibitor for the potential treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases by optimizing the pharmacokinetics  metabolic stability and in vivo efficacy of the lead compounds 
in april  the company entered into a collaboration agreement with servier pursuant to which pharmacyclics granted to servier an exclusive license for its pan hdac inhibitors  including pci  for territories throughout the world excluding the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  servier acquired the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the pan hdac inhibitor product worldwide except for the united states and will pay a royalty to pharmacyclics on sales outside of the united states 
pharmacyclics will continue to own all rights within the united states 
servier has committed significant resources to the clinical development of pci  with two phase i trials in lymphoma and solid tumors due to commence in europe in the last quarter of this year 
pci is a small molecule inhibitor of factor viia 
this drug selectively inhibits factor viia when it is complexed with a protein called tissue factor tf 
in cancer  the factor viia tf complex is found in abundance in pancreatic  gastric  colon and other tumors  and triggers a host of physiologic processes that facilitate tumor angiogenesis  growth and invasion 
the factor viia tf complex is thought to be the cause of the increased propensity to develop thromboses seen in cancer patients 
laboratory studies and animal models indicate that inhibitors of factor viia block the growth of tumors that express tf 
we have completed our initial phase i testing of pci in healthy volunteers 
the primary objective of the ascending dose phase i study was to assess the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of pci following a single  subcutaneous injection 
in addition  the safety and tolerability of pci was evaluated 
the drug was well tolerated and no adverse event was observed at any dose level 
the international normalized ratio inr of prothrombin time  a simple laboratory test for coagulation  was used to measure pharmacodynamic effect at dose levels of   and mg kg 
a mean peak inr of was achieved without adverse effects at the highest dose level administered 
the target inr range for oral anti coagulants ie coumadin  is between and the half life of pci was to hours  which compares favorably to the single dose half life of the low molecular weight heparin lovenox hours and fragmin to hours 
a multicenter phase i ii study is planned to begin in the fourth quarter of calendar the target patient population is locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer within two months of diagnosis either receiving or planned to receive gemcitabine therapy 
the goals will be to  a assess the safety of pci at pharmacologically active dose levels  b to assess potential survival benefit and c obtain initial information of the effects on the incidence of thromboembolic events 
pci is an orally active small molecule inhibitor of bruton s tyrosine kinase btk that is being developed by pharmacyclics for the treatment of patients with b cell lymphoma 
btk plays a prominent role in b cell lymphocyte maturation by mediating b cell receptor bcr signal transduction 
in the human genetic immunodeficiency disease x linked agammaglobulinemia  mutation of the gene that encodes the btk protein results in reduced bcr signaling and a failure to generate mature b cells 
recent studies indicate that some large b cell lymphomas have activation of the kinases downstream of the bcr and that inhibition of this signaling can induce apoptosis 
primary follicular lymphoma cells have also been found to maintain enhanced signaling from the bcr as compared to normal b cells 
in preclinical models  inhibition of btk by pci led to apoptosis in multiple b cell lymphoma cell lines  and inhibited b cell lymphoma progression in vivo 
pci also blocks b cell activation and inhibits autoantibody production in vivo 
rheumatoid arthritis ra and lupus are two chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by polyclonal b cell activation and the production of autoantibodies 
by selectively inhibiting btk  pci has demonstrated a dose dependent ability to inhibit disease development in ra and lupus in animal models 
in the collagen induced arthritis mouse model for example  oral administration of pci led to a regression of established disease 
btk is also required for signaling in mast cells and basophils  which are involved in allergic inflammation 
the activation of mast cells and basophils leads to the release of histamine and other mediators that lead to allergic symptoms  and thus btk inhibition may also be effective in allergy and other mast cell mediated diseases 
pci potently inhibits histamine release from human basophils and orally dosed pci blocks mast cell release in vivo in mouse studies 
a multicenter us phase i trial in b cell lymphoma is currently enrolling patients 
we have developed a proprietary molecular probe that we are using as a biomarker to optimize our treatment regimen in our phase i trial 
the phase i trial is designed to determine the safety and tolerability of a day dosing regimen and to evaluate effects on pharmacodynamic assays and tumor response 
mgd  is a radiation and chemotherapy sensitizing agent with a novel mechanism of action 
mgd is designed to accumulate selectively in cancer cells 
once inside cancer cells  mgd in combination with radiation induces apoptosis programmed cell death by disrupting redox dependent pathways 
mgd is also detectable by magnetic resonance imaging mri and may allow for more precise tumor detection 
the national cancer institute nci is currently sponsoring two phase ii trials which have and continue to provide valuable developmental insights and directions 
one phase ii trial is a multi center study in newly diagnosed gbm in combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide which has enrolled patients 
previous studies in malignant gliomas have shown that the combination of mgd and temozolomide has no additional overlapping toxicities when used in combination 
the second phase ii trial is a study in children with pontine gliomas in combination with radiation therapy 
enrollment of this patient study has been completed 
we are subject to risks common to pharmaceutical companies developing products  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  history of and expectation of future operating losses  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  and the need for future capital 
in order for a product to be commercialized  we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  build a us commercial capability  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may adversely affect the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that certain criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of up front collaboration payments  periodic milestone payments and payments for research activities 
our collaborations with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value and whether there is verifiable objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation are not met 
up front payments under agreements which include future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated at each reporting period 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenues related to substantive  at risk collaboration milestones are recognized upon achievement of the event specified in the underlying agreement 
revenues for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
share based compensation we adopted sfas r  share based payments  effective beginning july  using the modified prospective application transition method 
the modified prospective application transition method requires that companies recognize compensation expense on new share based payment awards and existing share based payment awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost of the portion of awards of which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the july  has been expensed as the requisite service was rendered 
options vest upon the passage of time or a combination of time and the achievement of certain performance obligations 
the compensation committee of the board of directors will determine if the performance conditions have been met 
share based compensation expense for the options with performance obligations is recorded when the company believes that the vesting of these options is probable 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of the company s stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as the company does not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior among its employee population 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the company s options 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf issued a consensus  eitf  accounting for collaboration arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  which is focused on how the parties to a collaborative agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties  how sharing payments pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the income statement and certain related disclosure questions 
eitf is to be applied retrospectively for collaboration arrangements in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no

fsp sfas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
fsp sfas and apb enhance consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures to a quarterly instead of annual basis for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet at fair value 
fsp sfas and apb are effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after june  the adoption of fsp sfas and apb did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 subsequent events 
sfas no 
establishes general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  this statement sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date

research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
prior to  we did not track our historical research and development costs by specific program and for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis

general and administrative expenses 
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our general and administrative g a expenses over the last three fiscal years 
change change general and administrative expenses   g a expenses in fiscal increased by  compared to fiscal primarily due to share based compensation expense of  and  of severance expenses associated with separation agreements entered into with the company s former ceo and cfo in september  partially offset by lower personnel costs of  due to lower headcount and a reduction of  in non severance related share based compensation expense 
g a expenses in fiscal decreased by  compared to fiscal the composition of g a expenses were similar in both fiscal years 
interest income 
interest income in fiscal was  a decrease of  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decline in interest rates earned on the company s investments 
interest income in fiscal was  a decrease of  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased investment balances 
interest expense and other income expense  net 
interest expense and other income expense  net was  in fiscal this amount primarily represents interest expense recorded on  of borrowings from an affiliate of robert w 
duggan consisting of  of non cash interest expense associated with discounting the notes payable to fair value and  of interest expense based on the stated interest rates of the notes 
income taxes 
the company recorded a tax provision of  in fiscal this tax provision is due to withholding taxes related to a million upfront payment the company received from servier pursuant to a collaboration and licensing agreement see note to the financial statements 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than  as defined  over a three year period 
such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
a full valuation allowance has been established for the company s deferred tax assets since realization of such assets through the generation of future taxable income is uncertain 
the company believes that due to the participation in the rights offering completed in july  it is likely that the change of control provision under the tax reform act of may have been triggered 
further analysis by the company is required to determine the amount of the annual limitation  if any 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital since inception have been private and public equity financings and proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as interest income 
since inception  we have used approximately  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment  leasehold improvements  and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended june  and resulted primarily from the operating loss partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and non cash share based compensation expense 
net cash used in operating activities was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash compensation expense and changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  prepaid expenses and other assets 
net cash provided by used in investing activities of   and  in the years ended june   and  respectively  primarily consisted of the net effect of purchases  maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities of  in the year ended june  consisted of proceeds from notes payable and the sale of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities of  and  in the years ended june  and  respectively  primarily consisted of proceeds from the sale of common stock  the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
on july   the company completed the sale of approximately million shares of common stock under a rights offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in april  we signed a collaboration and license agreement with servier 
in may  we received an upfront payment from servier of  less applicable withholding taxes of  for a net payment of  see note of the financial statements for a description of this agreement 
in february  we sold approximately million shares of unregistered common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
in december  we borrowed  from an affiliate of robert w 
duggan 
in march  the loan amount was increased to  in august  pursuant to the terms of the loans  the company repaid the  loans outstanding at june  see note of the financial statements for a description of these loans 
our future contractual obligations at june  are as follows operating lease notes commitments payable less than year   years  total  less unamortized original issue discount  total note payable  in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation now celera corporation business 
future milestone payments under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as million  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
in addition  celera will also be entitled to royalty payments in the mid to high single digits based on annual sales of any drugs commercialized from these programs 
based upon the current status of our product development plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  combined with the net proceeds of million  after repayment of our related party notes  from the rights offering completed in july  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect research and development expenses as a result of on going and future clinical trials to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
currently  we are actively seeking partnership collaborations to help fund the development of our product candidates 
we may also be required to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of securities  bank debt or otherwise 
if we are unable to secure additional funds  whether through partnership collaborations or sale of our securities  we will have to delay  reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following our ability to establish and the scope of any new partnership collaborations  the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be highly dilutive  or otherwise disadvantageous  to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms  would require us to reduce our operating expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements to develop our product candidates and to continue operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  would have potentially declined by  the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates fiscal year fair value at june  marketable securities   weighted average interest rate
