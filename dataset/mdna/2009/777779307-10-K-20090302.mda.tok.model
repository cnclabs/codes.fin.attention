a breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the terms of our indebtedness  including the financial covenants under our credit facilities  could result in a default under such indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the lenders for our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to us  and they and the lenders of our second lien term loan could accelerate the repayment of all of our indebtedness 
in such case  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders under the credit facilities could proceed against the collateral securing the facilities  which is substantially all of our assets 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 

table of contents properties we acquire may not produce as expected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 
we continually review opportunities to acquire producing properties  undeveloped acreage and drilling prospects  however  such reviews are not capable of identifying all potential conditions 
generally  it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition 
ordinarily  we will focus our review efforts on higher value properties or properties with known adverse conditions and will sample the remainder 
however  even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems or permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their condition  any deficiencies  and development potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as ground water contamination are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
our exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes  which are common in the gulf of mexico during certain times of the year  compliance with governmental regulations  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  and limitations in the market for oil and natural gas 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators 
they do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
because of these factors  we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures 
poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
numerous uncertainties are inherent in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and our estimated reserve quantities and present value calculations may not be accurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent petroleum engineers and geologists 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our engineers control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  expenditures for future development and exploration activities  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil and natural gas 
as an example  independent petroleum engineers netherland sewell s reserve report for year end includes the downward revision of bcfe of proved reserves and bcfe due to year end commodity prices  or approximately of previously estimated reserves 
actual future production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses  underlying information  quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information set forth herein 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on fixed prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our reserves as of december  were based on west texas intermediate oil prices of per bbl and henry hub gas prices of per mmbtu compared to and  respectively  at december  actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
in addition  discounted future net cash flows are estimated assuming royalties to the mms  royalty owners and other state and federal regulatory agencies with respect to our affected properties  and will be paid or suspended during the life of the properties based upon oil and natural gas prices as of the date of the estimate 
since actual future prices fluctuate over time  royalties may be required to be paid for various portions of the life of the properties and suspended for other portions of the life of the properties 

table of contents the timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor that we use to calculate the net present value of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with the sec s rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry  in general  will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor in arriving at an accurate net present value of future net cash flows 
we are subject to the full cost ceiling limitation which has resulted in a write down of our estimated net reserves and may result in a write down in the future if commodity prices continue to decline 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down of our estimated net reserves to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
however  we may not be subject to a write down if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a write down might otherwise be required 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  a write down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable in the subsequent period 
for the year ended december   we recognized a non cash  pre tax ceiling test impairment of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  should natural gas prices continue to decline in the future  it is possible that an additional write down could occur 
in addition  write downs of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
for example  we recognized a downward revision to our proved reserves in the third and fourth quarters of as we are continuing to evaluate and test our asset base  it is possible that we may recognize additional revisions to our proved reserves in the future

government laws and regulations can change 
our activities are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations 
extensive laws  regulations and rules relate to activities and operations in the oil and gas industry 
some of the laws  regulations and rules contain provisions for significant fines and penalties for non compliance 
changes in laws and regulations could affect our costs of operations and our profitability 
changes in laws and regulations could also affect production levels  royalty obligations  price levels  environmental requirements  and other matters affecting our business 
we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations or additions to laws and regulations 
such changes could significantly impact our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial position and future growth 
our business requires a sufficient level of staff with technical expertise  specialized knowledge and training and a high degree of management experience 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and experience required for our business 
an inability to sufficiently staff our operations or the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with critical skills could have a negative effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and future growth 

table of contents the ultimate outcome of any legal proceedings relating to our activities cannot be predicted 
any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
operation of our properties has generated various litigation matters arising out of the normal course of business 
the ultimate outcome of claims and litigation relating to our activities cannot presently be determined  nor can the liability that may potentially result from a negative outcome be reasonably estimated at this time for every case 
the liability we may ultimately incur with respect to any one of these matters in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently accrued with respect to such matters and  as a result  these matters may potentially be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas processing and transportation or the remote location of certain of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
in the gulf of mexico operations  the availability of a ready market depends on the proximity of and our ability to tie into existing production platforms owned or operated by others and the ability to negotiate commercially satisfactory arrangements with the owners or operators 
under interruptible or short term transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system or for other reasons specified by the particular agreements 
we may be required to shut in natural gas wells or delay initial production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas pipelines or gathering system capacity 
when that occurs  we are unable to realize revenue from those wells until the production can be tied to a gathering system 
this can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and natural gas and realization of revenues 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
many of our competitors  major and large independent oil and natural gas companies  possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
if oil and gas prices increase in the future  increasing levels of exploration and production could result in response to these stronger prices  and as a result  the demand for oilfield services could rise  and the costs of these services could increase  while the quality of these services may suffer 
if the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in texas and california  we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in those areas 
operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  or well fluids  fires  
table of contents hurricanes  tropical storms  earthquakes  mud slides  and flooding  pollution  and releases of toxic gas 
the occurrence of one of the above may result in injury  loss of life  property damage  suspension of operations  environmental damage and remediation and or governmental investigations and penalties 
in addition  our operations in california are especially susceptible to damage from natural disasters such as earthquakes and fires and involve increased risks of personal injury  property damage and marketing interruptions 
any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition  or could result in a loss of our properties 
our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities 
for example  we are not fully insured against earthquake risk in california because of high premium costs 
insurance covering earthquakes or other risks may not be available at premium levels that justify its purchase in the future  if at all 
in addition  we are subject to energy package insurance coverage limitations related to any single named windstorm 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
insurance costs could increase over the next few years and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur a liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  then our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
because of the expense of the associated premiums and the perception of risk  we do not have any insurance coverage for any loss of production as may be associated with these operating hazards 
environmental matters and costs can be significant 
the oil and natural gas business is subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
such laws and regulations may impose liability on us for pollution clean up  remediation  restoration and other liabilities arising from or related to our operations 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production 
we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
the cost of future compliance is uncertain and is subject to various factors  including future changes to laws and regulations 
we have no assurance that future changes in or additions to the environmental laws and regulations will not have a significant impact on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and future growth 
our acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy includes acquiring oil and natural gas businesses and properties if favorable economics and strategic objectives can be served 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including division of management s attention  ability or impediments to conducting thorough due diligence activities  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from the acquired businesses and properties or realize other anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 

table of contents we are vulnerable to risks associated with operating in the gulf of mexico 
our operations and financial results could be significantly impacted by unique conditions in the gulf of mexico because we explore and produce in that area 
as a result of this activity  we are vulnerable to the risks associated with operating in the gulf of mexico  including those relating to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  availability of required performance bonds and insurance  oil field service costs and availability  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations  remediation and other costs resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials  and failure of equipment or facilities 
further  production of reserves from reservoirs in the gulf of mexico generally decline more rapidly than from fields in many other producing regions of the world 
this results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the gulf of mexico during the initial years of production  and as a result  our reserve replacement needs from new prospects may be greater there than for our operations elsewhere 
also  our revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains  result in financial losses or reduce our income 
we have entered into natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production through as of december   and of our natural gas production was hedged using swaps and costless collars  respectively  with settlement in  and of our natural gas production was hedged with swaps for settlement in  based on anticipated future gas production 
such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts 
our current hedge positions are with counterparties that are lenders in our credit facilities 
our lenders are comprised of banks and financial institutions that could default or fail to perform under our contractual agreements 
a default under any of these agreements could negatively impact our financial performance 
we have also entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the change in the variable interest rates associated with our debt under our credit facility 
if interest rates should fall below the rate established in the hedge  we may not receive the benefit of the lower interest rates 
future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline  which could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock 
stock sales and purchases by institutional investors or stockholders with significant holdings could have significant influence over our stock volatility and our corresponding ability to raise capital through debt or equity offerings 
because institutional investors have the ability to trade in large volumes of shares of our common stock  the price of our common stock could be subject to significant volatility  which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock as well as limit our ability to raise capital or issue additional equity in the future 
you may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common and preferred stock 
we may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued equity securities  resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders and purchasers of common stock offered hereby 
we are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of  shares of capital stock consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors 
as of december    shares of common stock were issued  including  shares of restricted stock issued to certain employees and directors 
the majority of these shares vest over a three year period 
of the restricted stock that has been granted   shares had vested as of december  and the remaining shares will vest no later than pursuant to our amended long term incentive plan  we have reserved  shares of our common stock for issuance as restricted stock  stock options and or other equity based grants to employees and directors 
in addition  we have issued  options to purchase common stock issued to certain employees and directors  of which  have been exercised as of december  the potential issuance of additional shares of common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
we may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with the hiring of personnel  future acquisitions  future issuance of our securities for capital raising purposes  or for other business purposes

title to properties our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions as well as mortgage liens on at least of our proved reserves in accordance with our credit facilities 
we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 
we believe that we have generally satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties 
as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties 
we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets 
although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business 
item legal proceedings we are party to various oil and natural gas litigation matters arising out of the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
calpine settlement on december   calpine filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
two years later  on december   the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of reorganization for calpine  which emerged from bankruptcy on january  during that period  on june   calpine commenced the lawsuit 
over the next fourteen months  the company vigorously disputed calpine s contentions in the lawsuit  including any and all allegations that it underpaid for calpine s oil and gas business 
on october   calpine and the company announced that they had entered into the settlement agreement which  among other things  would i resolve all claims in the lawsuit  ii result in calpine conveying clean legal title on all remaining oil and gas assets to rosetta except those properties subject to the preferential rights of third parties who have indicated a desire to exercise their rights  iii settle all pending claims the company filed in the calpine bankruptcy  iv modify and extend a gas purchase agreement by which calpine purchases the company s dedicated production from the sacramento valley  california  and v formalize the assumption by calpine of the july  purchase and sale agreement together with all interrelated agreements  the purchase agreement by which calpine s oil and gas business was conveyed to the company thus resulting in the parties honoring their obligations under the purchase agreement on a going forward basis 
the settlement agreement became effective when the bankruptcy court entered its order on november   authorizing the execution of the settlement agreement and the performance of the obligations set forth therein 
no objections or appeals to this order were filed or taken with the bankruptcy court before or after the hearing on november   and it became final on or about november  
table of contents the parties completed this settlement pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement on december  the cash component of the settlement consisted of million payable in cash to calpine to resolve all outstanding legal disputes regarding various matters  including calpine s fraudulent conveyance lawsuit 
in addition  the company paid million under the purchase agreement to close the original acquisition transaction of the producing properties that were the subject of the lawsuit 
this million consisted of million  which the company withheld from the purchase price at the closing on july   related to non consent properties excluding the properties subject to the petersen preferential rights that were not conveyed to the company at closing on july   as well as million for various disputed post closing adjustments under the terms of the purchase agreement  as amended by the bankruptcy court order to remove the properties that had been subject to the petersen preferential rights  as if these properties had not been part of the purchase agreement 
as a result of the conclusion of this settlement  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of  which is included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations
