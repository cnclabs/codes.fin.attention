critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
identified below are some of the more significant accounting policies followed by the company in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see note description of company and significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition in general  the company recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met  which typically is when evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided or goods have been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues for services are recorded in the period the services are rendered 
revenues for products are recorded in the period delivered based on sales prices established with the client or its insurer prior to delivery 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company reviews its accounts receivable balances on a periodic basis 
accounts receivable have been reduced by the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts is primarily based on historical analysis of the company s records 
the analysis is based on patient and institutional client payment histories  the aging of the accounts receivable  and specific review of patient and institutional client records 
as actual collection experience changes  revisions to the allowance may be required 
any unanticipated change in customers creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from customers could have a material effect on the results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all reasonable attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has acquired several entities resulting in the recording of intangible assets  including goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances  by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company assesses goodwill related to reporting units for impairment and writes down the carrying amount of goodwill as required 
as of march   the company had three distinct reporting units included in continuing operations services  pharmacy and catalog 
the company had three additional reporting units included in discontinued operations hhe  industrial staffing and pharmacy software 
each reporting unit represents a distinct business unit that offers different products and services 
segment management monitors each unit separately 
sfas no 
requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the company compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  the company estimates the fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings for comparable companies or expected sales prices for the reporting units held for sale 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the company is required to perform the second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compares it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
sfas no 
also requires that the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value 
the company estimates the fair value of these intangible assets using the income approach 
the company recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
intangible assets with finite lives 
table of contents are amortized over their useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions the company believes to be reasonable but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company makes certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach in valuing its reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate the carrying values for each of the company s reporting units 
acquired finite lived intangible assets are amortized using the economic benefit method when reliable information regarding future cash flows is available and the straight line method when this information is unavailable 
the estimated useful lives are as follows trade name years customer relationships depending on the type of business purchased to years income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized currently for the future tax consequences attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as for tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred tax asset 
judgment is used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets and review the amount of such allowance periodically 
when we determine certain deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be utilized  we will reduce our valuation allowance accordingly 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
internal revenue code section rules limit the utilization of net operating losses following a change in control of a company 
it has been determined that a change in control of the company took place at the time of the reverse merger in therefore  the company s ability to utilize certain net operating losses generated by critical home care will be subject to severe limitations in future periods  which could have an effect of eliminating substantially all the future income tax benefits of the respective net operating losses 
tax benefits from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded at such time as they are considered more likely than not to be realized

during fiscal  home care revenues increased approximately over the same period a year ago 
a majority of this increase represents organic growth in several of the company s main geographic markets 
the increase in sales included growth in government programs served  as well as private pay and insurance clients 
the growth in home care revenues was approximately offset by significant year over year declines in revenue in the medical staffing and travel staffing markets  which declined by approximately and  respectively  as compared with the prior year 
demand for the company s per diem and travel medical staffing services declined as compared with the same period a year ago 
several factors have contributed to the lower level of overall demand  including lower patient censuses in facilities  constraints on facility staffing budgets  the return of part time staff to full time status and increases in overtime accepted by permanent staff of our potential customers  largely in response to overall economic conditions  and delays in the construction and opening of new facilities that often drives short term staffing requirements 
gross margins in the services segment increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the cost of revenues in this segment consists primarily of employee costs  including wages  taxes  fringe benefits and workers compensation expense 
the year over year improvement in gross margins was driven primarily by two factors 
the first was a reduction in workers compensation expense  reflecting the success of the company s on going efforts to control and reduce these costs through improved training  timelier reporting and investigation of claims  and reduced administrative costs 
the second factor was the increased mix of home care revenue as a percentage of sales  with margins in this market being significantly higher than gross margins in medical and travel staffing 
pharmacy segment the revenue in the pharmacy segment increased by during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to its dailymed programs 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  revenue generated from the company s dailymed medication management program began to increase at a more rapid pace than in previous quarters  and the company continues to pursue additional opportunities with government entities  managed care organizations  assisted living and group home facilities  existing home care customers and in direct to consumer initiatives

the bad debt expense for the current year reflects a more typical pattern of collection experience 
affiliate commissions are based on the gross margins of the individual affiliates  and the decrease reflects a decrease in revenues and gross margins generated from the affiliate owned locations for fiscal compared to the prior year 
pharmacy segment the increase in the pharmacy segment selling  general and administrative expense from  in fiscal to  in fiscal was due to the following the company s investment in the infrastructure and additional employees necessary to support the expected growth in the pharmacy segment

catalog segment the catalog segment selling  general and administrative expense decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due to a decrease in catalog production and mailing costs as the company changed its approach in an attempt to increase profitability by printing and sending fewer catalogs to a more targeted audience 

table of contents corporate none of the corporate selling  general and administrative expenses were allocated to the discontinued operations 
the  increase in corporate selling  general and administrative expense during fiscal was due to the following a change in the classification of certain employees who were previously included in the services segment to corporate 
historically  employees in the southfield  michigan location supported the services segment almost exclusively 
during fiscal  the company centralized many of its corporate functions in southfield  michigan  and these employees now support the entire organization 
beginning in fiscal  the company began to more accurately separate and record these corporate functions from the segment specific functions  and beginning in fiscal  corporate absorbed all insurance expense in a effort to consolidate and review all policies 
during fiscal  insurance expense was charged to the various segments 
this resulted in a  increase in corporate sg a expenses 
on a consolidated basis  insurance expense increased by approximately  in fiscal these increases were partially offset by the following in the third quarter of fiscal  the company hired an in house legal counsel  and since this hiring  the company s legal fees have decreased significantly

this increase reflects the increase in depreciation associated with various software and computer equipment acquired over the last two years 
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by  or  during the year ended march  the decrease reflects the decrease in the amortization associated with customer relationships 
the company primarily uses the economic benefit method of amortizing intangible assets  which attempts to match the amortization expense with the anticipated economic benefit of the asset as determined at the time of the acquisition 
the estimated economic benefit typically decreases as more time passes since the acquisition 
as such  the corresponding amortization expense also decreases 
as discussed below  the company wrote off  in acquired amortizable intangible assets during the fiscal fourth quarter of this will significantly reduce the amortization expense in future years 

table of contents goodwill and intangible asset impairment no goodwill or intangible asset impairment expense was recognized in continuing operations during fiscal the following summarizes the goodwill and intangible asset impairment expense for fiscal acquired intangible goodwill assets total pharmacy catalog goodwill and intangible asset impairment total goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process is completed 
based on the impairment analysis performed as of march   the company recognized a pharmacy goodwill impairment charge of  the pharmacy business has evolved since the prairiestone acquisition in february  and it is now primarily focused on its dailymed offering 
while management believes that the growth potential for this business unit is significant  it is difficult to project future revenue and cash flow streams based on historic performance 
as such  management determined that an impairment charge was appropriate 
the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment  the company recognized an impairment expense relating to the pharmacy segment s customer relationships of  within the catalog business unit  operating profits and cash flows for the years ended march  and were lower than expected 
management continues to explore various alternative strategies for this business  but the expected future cash flows was not adequate to support the fair value of either the remaining customer relationship balance or the goodwill  both of which were reduced to at march  interest expense and income the following table summarizes interest expense and income for the fiscal years ended march in thousands increase increase decrease decrease interest expense interest income the average interest bearing liabilities balance balance as of each quarter end during the fiscal year and the beginning year balance divided by five for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  which represents a reduction of

the next million in proceeds are then paid to the lenders as provided in the promissory notes

cash proceeds received at the closings  net of fees  less amounts used to pay down debt totaled the company has expanded revenues in the pharmacy segment over the last two quarters of fiscal and has seen a year over year increase in home care revenue 
management believes that it will make further progress with implementing its strategic plan in fiscal the company believes that its focus on two core businesses will enable it to realize operational improvements in both the services and pharmacy segments 
these planned operational improvements include growth in home care revenues  growth in dailymed revenues  improved gross margins in the pharmacy segment and more efficient operation of its pharmacy facilities as the dailymed volumes grow 
in addition to these operational improvements  the company intends to make significant further reductions in corporate sg a expense in order to bring these expenses more in line with current and projected revenues 
with these operational improvements and expense reductions  the company believes that its available cash  coupled with existing credit facilities  will provide sufficient funding to support its business requirements during the upcoming year 
moreover  with the company s reduced debt levels described above  improved performance and its focus on two core business platforms  management believes that it would be able to raise additional capital to support operating cash requirements and to fund investment in growth opportunities 
this capital could be in the form of debt financing  private equity placements and or investments in its core business platforms by strategic business partners 
at the same time  because of normal fluctuations in the timing of the company s cash receipts and disbursements  management is focused on disciplined management of its cash flow 
while management believes it will

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our cash balances and cash equivalents are held primarily in highly liquid commercial bank accounts 
the company utilizes lines of credit to fund operational cash needs 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our cash equivalents and our borrowings 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
all revenues since inception have been in the us and in us dollars  therefore  management has not yet adopted a strategy for foreign currency rate exposure as it is not anticipated that foreign revenues are likely to occur in the near future
