item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information  included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
company overview casella waste systems  inc is a vertically integrated regional solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services to residential  industrial and commercial customers  primarily in the eastern united states 
our company was founded in as a single truck operation in rutland  vermont and the business now operates in states 
we operate vertically integrated solid waste operations in vermont  new hampshire  new york  massachusetts  and maine  and stand alone materials processing facilities in connecticut  pennsylvania  new jersey  north carolina  tennessee  georgia  florida  michigan and wisconsin 
as of may   we owned and or operated solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  recycling facilities  nine subtitle d landfills  one landfill permitted to accept construction and demolition materials  and one waste to energy facility  as well as a interest in a joint venture that manufactures  markets and sells cellulose insulation made from recycled fiber 
we also have a interest in a company that markets an incentive based recycling service and a interest in a surety company which provides surety bonds to us to secure contractual performance for municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post closure obligations 
outlook recent economic conditions had a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations in the fiscal year ended april  the slowdown in the us economy resulted in lower solid waste collection volumes in fiscal year  compared to the prior year  particularly in our commercial and industrial collection lines 
landfill construction and demolition volumes declined in fiscal year as a result of a slowdown in construction activities 
landfill volumes also decreased year over year due to the planned closure of the colebrook facility  which ceased operation in the second quarter of fiscal year pricing initiatives in the solid waste collection operations contributed positively in fiscal year while landfill prices declined year over year due to the effect of market pressure on pricing due to lower volumes in the market place 
the continuing weak economy and lack of liquidity in the credit markets will likely result in continued negative pressure on consumer and business spending  which will result in lower future business volumes and resulting cash flows 
we have reacted to these economic conditions by managing various expense categories and capital expenditures 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a severance and reorganization charge of million which consisted of employee severance and benefit costs and operating lease costs as a result of the consolidation of several operating units into market areas  the elimination of one region office as well as other workforce reductions 
also  in fiscal year we reduced a substantial portion of our incentive compensation accrual including all amounts due under our annual incentive compensation plan 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at april  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at april  the main factor accounting for the decrease in net working capital was the classification of our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes as current debt 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included under item of this form k  our senior secured credit facility  including the revolving credit facility and 
table of contents term b loan  are scheduled to expire on april  we have received a waiver of various covenants under the senior secured credit facility which is in effect through july  if we are unsuccessful in refinancing before this date  it is likely that we will be in default under our senior secured credit facility 
default of the credit facility may trigger default under the senior subordinated notes which would result in an accelerated redemption of the notes 
for this reason  we have classified the senior subordinated notes as current debt as of april  given the impending expiration of the senior secured credit facility  we plan to refinance in the first quarter of fiscal year we anticipate that the refinancing will be effected through a combination of a revolving credit facility  term loan b and secured note or other offering  depending on market conditions 
the refinancing will be at terms reflective of the distressed credit markets which will increase our future debt service costs 
we may also seek alternative sources of capital 
we cannot be certain that it will be successful in refinancing its debt and may not have access to the amount of capital it requires  on favorable terms or at all 
as we would not be able to repay our senior secured credit facility obligations in accordance with the contractual terms without either refinancing this debt or obtaining additional debt or equity financing in sufficient amounts  our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our fiscal year consolidated financial statements that includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we have performed its annual assessment of goodwill impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year by applying a fair value test to identified reporting segments 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit  which we determined to be our four operating segments eastern  western  central and fcr 
effective february  we combined the management of the former south eastern and north eastern regions into the eastern region 
in conjunction with this combination  maine energy  which was formerly a separate reporting unit  was also combined into the eastern region reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was compared with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
consistent with prior years  to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we used discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit 
this analysis included a determination of an appropriate discount rate  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses were based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
the discount rate used at the test date was our risk adjusted discount rate applicable for each reporting unit 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to our current market capitalization based on our stock price plus an estimated control premium 
the step one test determined that the fair value of our eastern region reporting segment was less than its carrying value 
the reasons for this outcome were the continued deterioration of the equity and credit markets and the economy and their related impact on i our projected near term cash flows  due to lower projected landfill volumes and commodity pricing and ii an increase in our risk adjusted discount rate 
we proceeded to a step two analysis  which included valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the eastern region to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the result of this assessment indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero 
as a result we recognized a non cash pre tax charge of million for the quarter ended april   to write off the entire carrying value of the eastern region goodwill 
in anticipation of the possibility that we would be required to record non cash charges  including a goodwill impairment charge  in our financial statements for the year ended april   we sought and received a waiver from our lenders on june  of various covenants under this credit facility 
table of contents which we would have otherwise breached as a result of these non cash charges 
the lenders have given us a waiver with respect to this and other non cash charges  however  the waiver is only applicable to our april  financial statements and will remain in effect through july  the waiver does not include a waiver of our financial covenant compliance for the quarter ended july   and accordingly  if we are unable to complete our refinancing by that date  it is likely we will be in default under our senior secured credit facility unless we seek another waiver 
operating results for the year ended april   the company reported revenues of million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the year ended april  solid waste revenues  including the company s major accounts program  decreased  with lower collection and landfill volumes accounting for of the decrease and lower commodity prices and volumes of the decline 
these decreases were partially offset by the positive effect of price increases  including fuel and environmental surcharges  of  primarily from our collection operations  and from the rollover effect of a major accounts tuck in acquisition 
fcr recycling revenues decreased  with coming from lower commodity prices and from lower volumes in the quarter 
for the quarter ended april   the company reported revenues of million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the quarter ended april  solid waste revenues  including the company s major accounts program  decreased  with lower collection and landfill volumes accounting for of the decrease and lower commodity prices and volumes of the decline 
these decreases were partially offset by the positive effect of price increases  including fuel and environmental surcharges  of  primarily from our collection operations  and from the rollover effect of a major accounts tuck in acquisition 
fcr recycling revenues decreased  with coming from lower commodity prices and from lower volumes in the quarter 
fcr recycling revenues declined million in fiscal year compared to the prior year  as a result of a sharp decline in commodity prices at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year  driven by a severe drop in demand for all of the company s commodity product line as a result of global economic conditions 
the company does not expect to see stabilization and growth in commodity prices in many grades until the global economic climate improves 
prices in the recycling commodity markets began to partially rebound in the quarter ended april   including fiber newspapers  cardboard  and mixed papers and plastic prices 
the decrease in fcr recycling revenues were partially offset by hedge contracts which reduce the impact of pricing fluctuations on a portion of fcr s fiber volumes and from an increase in tipping fees year over year 
eastern region revenues declined million  or  primarily due to the idling of a construction and demolition processing plant and the ramp down of landfill volumes at the pine tree landfill  partially offset by higher revenues from volume increases at other landfill locations as well as revenue increases from the pine tree landfill gas to energy facility 
collection revenues decreased year over year as volume declines more than offset price increases 
western region revenues decreased million or due to lower collection volumes  partially offset by price increases 
landfill prices declined year over year and the volume increases at our hyland and ontario facilities were partially offset by volume declines at the hakes construction and demolition site 
revenues from landfill gas to energy projects and carbon emission credits at our ontario and hyland facility contributed positively to revenue growth year over year 
central region revenues decreased million or due to lower collection and landfill volumes and the effect of lower commodity prices 
revenue declines from the planned closure of the colebrook landfill  which ceased operations in august  were million year over year 
these decreases were partially offset by collection and landfill price increases  the positive effect of tuck in acquisitions and the start up of the landfill gas to energy facility at the clinton county landfill 

table of contents operating loss for the fiscal year was million compared to operating income of million in fiscal year the company s operating results were negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charge discussed above as well as by environmental remediation charges in the third quarter of million for the estimated cost of its share of work associated with a consent order issued by the state of new york to remediate the scrap yard and solid waste transfer station owned by waste stream  inc  a subsidiary of the company  and in the fourth quarter  in which the company recognized an additional charge of million for this same matter in recognition of the deteriorating financial condition and eventual bankruptcy filing by general motors corporation  one of the other responsible parties to this obligation

we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
recycling revenues  which are included in fcr and the central and western regions  consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
we also generate and sell electricity under a contract at our waste to energy facility and at certain of our landfill facilities 
our cellulose insulation business is conducted through a joint venture with louisiana pacific corporation  and accordingly  we recognize half of the joint venture s net income on the equity method in our results of operations 
the company also has a interest in a company that markets an incentive based recycling service and a interest in a surety company which provides surety bonds to the company to secure contractual performance for municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and post closure obligations

fiscal year ended april  collection landfill disposal facilities transfer recycling total revenues collection  landfill disposal facilities and transfer revenues each increased as a percentage of total revenues in the fiscal year ended compared to fiscal year  mainly because of the decrease in recycling revenues 
the dollar decrease in collection revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to lower volumes  partially offset by price increases and the effect of a major accounts tuck in acquisition 
the dollar increase in transfer revenue in fiscal year is primarily due to volume growth 
recycling revenues are primarily from recycling facilities in the fcr recycling region 
as noted above  fcr recycling revenues were negatively impacted as a result of a sharp decline in commodity prices in fiscal year compared to fiscal year collection and landfill disposal facilities revenues each decreased as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  mainly because of the increase in recycling revenues due to higher commodity prices 
collection and transfer revenue dollars increased in fiscal year due to the positive impact of price and volume increases in the eastern region and in the company s major accounts programs and the effect of tuck in acquisitions in the central  western and eastern regions and within the major accounts program

in fiscal year  the company completed the sale of the assets of the holliston transfer station in the eastern region for cash sale proceeds of million 
a loss amounting to million net of tax was recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year in fiscal year the company recorded the true up of certain contingent liabilities associated with the holliston transaction amounting to a gain of million net of tax recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations and also completed the sale of the company s buffalo  ny transfer station  hauling operation and related equipment in the western region for proceeds of million including a note receivable for million and net cash proceeds of million 
a loss amounting to million net of tax has been recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 
table of contents the company terminated its operation of mts environmental  a soils processing operation in the eastern region  in fiscal year a charge was recorded amounting to million associated with the abandonment 
included in this charge was the write off of the carrying value of assets along with costs associated with vacating the site 
a loss amounting to million net of tax has been recorded to loss on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year as of april   the company also deemed its fcr greenville operation as held for sale and classified this operation as a discontinued operation pursuant to the requirements of sfas no the divestiture was completed in june for cash proceeds of million 
the operating results of the operations discussed above  including those related to prior years  have been reclassified from continuing to discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development and cell construction  as well as site and cell closure 
our capital expenditures are broadly defined as pertaining to either growth or maintenance activities 
growth capital expenditures are defined as costs related to development of new airspace  permit expansions  new recycling contracts along with incremental costs of equipment and infrastructure added to further such activities 
growth capital expenditures include the cost of equipment added directly as a result of new business as well as expenditures associated with increasing infrastructure to increase throughput at transfer stations and recycling facilities 
growth capital expenditures also include those outlays associated with acquiring landfill operating leases  which do not meet the operating lease payment definition  but which were included as a commitment in the successful bid 
maintenance capital expenditures are defined as landfill cell construction costs not related to expansion airspace  costs for normal permit renewals and replacement costs for equipment due to age or obsolescence 
we generally meet liquidity needs from operating cash flow and from external sources including our senior secured credit facility 
these liquidity needs are primarily for capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs and capping  closure and post closure expenditures and acquisitions 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at april  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at april  net working capital comprises current assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  minus current liabilities 
the main factor accounting for the decrease in net working capital was the classification of our senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes as current debt 
the senior credit facility matures april  and we expect to refinance the facility in the first quarter of fiscal year we anticipate that the refinancing will be effected through a combination of a revolving credit facility  term loan b and secured bond or other offering  depending on market conditions 
the refinancing will likely be at terms reflective of the distressed credit markets which will increase our debt service costs 
we may also seek alternative sources of capital 
we cannot be certain that it will be successful in refinancing its debt and it may not have access to the amount of capital that it requires  on favorable terms or at all 
we have received a waiver  as discussed below  of various covenants under the senior secured credit facility which is in effect through july  if we are unsuccessful in refinancing before this date  it is likely that we will be in default under our senior secured credit facility 
default of the credit facility may trigger default under the senior subordinated notes which would result in an accelerated redemption of the notes 
for this reason  we have classified the senior subordinated notes as current debt as of april  the senior revolving credit facility agreement  as amended may   contains covenants that may limit the company s activities including covenants that forbid the payment of dividends on common stock 
as of april   these covenants restricted capital expenditures to times depreciation and landfill amortization  set a minimum net worth requirement of million  a 
table of contents minimum interest coverage ratio of  a maximum consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of and a maximum senior funded debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of 
in anticipation of the possibility that we would be required to record non cash charges  including a goodwill impairment charge  in our financial statements for the year ended april   we sought and received a waiver from our lenders on june  of various covenants under this credit facility which we would have otherwise breached as a result of such non cash charges 
the lenders have given us a waiver with respect to this and other non cash charges  however  the waiver is only applicable to our april  financial statements and will remain in effect through july  the waiver does not include a waiver of our financial covenant compliance for the quarter ended july  and accordingly  if we are unable to complete our refinancing by that date  it is likely that we will be in default under our senior secured credit facility unless we obtain another waiver 
the senior subordinated note indenture contains covenants that restrict dividends  stock repurchases and other payments  and limits the incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock 
as of april   we were in compliance with all covenants 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year growth capital expenditures were million and million in fiscal years and respectively  and maintenance capital expenditures were million and million in fiscal years and respectively 
capital spending was lower in fiscal year mainly due to delayed landfill projects 
we also financed million in capital projects in fiscal year through financing lease obligations that were not included in our reported statement of cash flows as capital expenditures 
we expect capital spending to be between million and million in fiscal year on april   we entered into a senior credit facility with a group of banks for which bank of america is acting as agent 
the facility originally consisted of a senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
on july   we amended the facility to increase the amount to million  and on may   we further amended the facility to increase the amount of the facility to million  including a million term b loan and a revolver of million 
this credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and secured by certain assets  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures in april the initial borrowings under the credit facility were used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the former credit facility 
further advances were available under the revolver in the amount of million and million as of april  and  respectively 
these available amounts are net of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit totaling million and million as of april  and  respectively 
as of april  and  no amounts had been drawn under the outstanding letters of credit 
we have historically entered into interest rate derivative agreements to balance fixed and floating rate debt interest risk in accordance with management s criteria 
the agreements are contracts to exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments periodically over a specified term without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
the agreements provide only for the exchange of interest on the notional amounts at the stated rates  with no multipliers or leverage 
differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt 
our outstanding derivative agreements at april  have a total notional value of million and require us to pay interest based on changes in libor and receive interest at a fixed rate of approximately 
our derivative agreements mature in may in accordance with sfas no 
 the fair value of our derivative contracts deemed to be effective cash flow hedges was an obligation million and 
million  with the net amount net of income tax benefit of million and 
million recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at april  and  respectively 
in fiscal year we recorded 
table of contents interest expense amounting to million associated with interest rate derivative contracts deemed to be ineffective 
as of april   we had outstanding million of senior subordinated notes the notes which mature in february the senior subordinated note indenture contains covenants that restrict dividends  stock repurchases and other payments  and limits the incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock 
the notes are guaranteed jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally by our significant wholly owned subsidiaries 
on december   we completed a million financing transaction involving the issuance by the finance authority of maine the authority of million aggregate principal amount of its solid waste disposal revenue bonds casella waste systems  inc project series the bonds 
the bonds are issued pursuant to an indenture  dated as of december  the indenture and are enhanced by an irrevocable  transferable direct pay letter of credit issued by bank of america  na pursuant to a financing agreement  dated as of december   by and between us and the authority  we have borrowed the proceeds of the bonds to pay for certain costs relating to landfill development and construction  vehicle  container and related equipment acquisition for solid waste collection and transportation services  improvements to existing solid waste disposal  hauling  transfer station and other facilities  other infrastructure improvements  and machinery and equipment for solid waste disposal operations owned and operated by us  or a related party  all located in maine  and the issuance of the bonds 
on august   we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock  pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirements set forth in the certificate of designation for the series a preferred stock 
the shares were redeemed at an aggregate redemption price of million  which was the liquidation value equal to the original price plus accrued but unpaid dividends through the date of redemption 
the redemption of the series a preferred stock was effected through cash payouts by us of the redemption price upon receipt of stock certificates and other related documentation from the holders thereof 
we borrowed against the senior credit facility to fund this redemption 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years ended april  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
fiscal year net loss adjusted for impairment charges  loss on disposal of discontinued operations  loss from discontinued operations  environmental remediation charge and development project charges totaled million 
this resulted in a decrease of million when compared to the fiscal year total of million 
lower depreciation and amortization in fiscal year versus fiscal resulted in a million decrease 
landfill amortization expense decreased by million primarily due to lower volumes as result of the planned closure of our colebrook facility  which closed in the second quarter of fiscal year  as well as the ramp down of landfill volumes at the pine tree landfill  partially offset by an increase in amortization at our worcester facility due to increased volumes 
the increase in deferred taxes in fiscal year versus was primarily associated with the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a million increase 
changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures  increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year changes in accounts receivable amounted to a million increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to lower revenues 
changes in accounts payable in fiscal year amounted to million of cash used compared with million used in the prior year due to lower operating costs and lower capital expenditures 
lower restricted cash amounts at april  due to the liquidation of assets held in trust as collateral for the company s financial obligations relative to its self insurance claims liability amounted to a million increase in cash 
changes in prepaid expenses  inventories and other assets amounted to cash provided of million in fiscal year compared to cash provided of million in fiscal year the 
table of contents increase in cash provided of million from the prior year is due primarily to the following changes in prepaid expenses associated with the timing of insurance payments  prepaid consulting and payroll fundings amounting to a million increase and lower net refundable income taxes at april   amounting to a million increase 
changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities amounted to cash used of million in fiscal year compared to cash used of million in fiscal year the increase in cash used of million is due primarily to the following reductions associated with higher payroll accruals at april  amounting to million  higher payments for landfill capping  closure and post closure in fiscal year versus the prior year amounting to million  lower accrued interest at april  associated with lower interest rates and the timing of borrowings partially offset by higher average debt levels amounting to a million decrease  offset by higher other long term liabilities at april  associated with the maine energy settlement which took place in fiscal year resulting in a million increase and an increase of million associated with other accrued expenses due to higher accruals for capital projects at april  net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million used in investing activities in fiscal year the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal year of million  lower acquisition activity in the current year amounting to million due primarily to the final earnout payment associated with blue mountain recycling  llc in fiscal year lower fiscal year payments on landfill operating lease contracts amounting to a million decrease in cash used  offset by higher investments in unconsolidated entities in fiscal year versus fiscal year amounting to million lower proceeds from assets under contractual obligations in fiscal year amounting to million and lower proceeds from divestitures and sale of equipment in fiscal year amounting to million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to provided in fiscal year the increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily due to reductions in the company s long term debt 
in fiscal year  we acquired three solid waste hauling operations in exchange for million in cash consideration 
in fiscal year  we acquired five solid waste hauling operations 
these transactions were in exchange for total consideration of million  including million in cash and in notes payable to seller 
we also made a final earnout payment of million to the members of blue mountain recycling  llc which was acquired in fiscal year for the landfill operating lease contracts  we made payments totaling million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we have filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec 
we may from time to time issue securities thereunder in an amount of up to million 
our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering and therefore we may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms  if at all 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years fiscal year s ending april  thereafter total long term debt financing lease obligations interest obligations operating leases capping closure post closure total contractual cash obligations we are considering debt obligations under our senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes as being due effective july  assuming we are unsuccessful in refinancing our senior secured credit facility resulting in default and accelerated maturity 
interest obligations on this debt also considers the accelerated maturity 
interest obligations based on debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt were calculated using variable rates in effect at april  included in interest obligations are obligations associated with interest rate derivative agreements amounting to  for fiscal year ending april  obligations related to interest rate derivative agreements were calculated using the appropriate variable interest index in effect at april  includes obligations related to landfill operating lease contracts 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year in addition to the above obligations  we have unrecognized tax benefits at april  of approximately million 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the timing of cash settlements 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we have implemented a fuel surcharge program  which is designed to recover fuel price fluctuations 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
landfills the cost estimates for capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs  pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each capping event and the timing of construction related to each capping event and of closure and post closure activities 
because landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of construction of future landfill capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
units of consumption amortization rates are determined annually for each of our operating landfills 
the rates are based on estimates provided by our engineers and accounting personnel and consider the information provided by airspace surveys  which are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could materially increase our landfill depletion rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
landfill development costs we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity 
this estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  landfill gas collection systems  environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas  directly related engineering  capitalized interest  on site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs 
additionally  landfill development includes all land purchases for landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property 
the projection of these landfill costs is dependent  in part  on future events 
the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs 
under life cycle accounting  all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to income based on tonnage placed into each site 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and expansion capacity 

table of contents landfill capping costs capping includes installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
capping activities occur throughout the life of the landfill 
our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each capping event based on the acreage to be capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill 
landfill closure and post closure closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
closure and post closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and expansion airspace 
remaining permitted airspace our engineers  in consultation with third party engineering consultants and surveyors  are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills 
the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey  which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography 
expansion airspace we include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances 
to be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received  and senior management has approved the project 
for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  the expansion effort must meet all of the criteria listed above 
these criteria are annually evaluated by our engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
once the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic 
table of contents yards  an airspace utilization factor  or auf  is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons 
the auf is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  as well as the projected asset retirement cost related to capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
after determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills  we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons 
we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 
these rates per ton are updated annually  or more often  as significant facts change 
it is possible that actual results  including the amount of costs incurred  the timing of capping  closure and post closure activities  our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher capping  closure or post closure rates  or higher expenses  or higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs 
most significantly  if it is determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset  we may be required to recognize an asset impairment 
if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities our environmental liabilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
and sop no 
 environmental remediation liabilities sop 
the recorded liabilities represent our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined liability is probable 
these liabilities include potentially responsible party  or prp  investigations  settlements  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we provide for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on site specific facts and circumstances 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and annually assess goodwill impairment at the end of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year by applying a fair value test 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments and fcr  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
we test goodwill at this reporting unit level because the business is managed and reported at this level 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings 

table of contents to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate applicable for each reporting unit 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 
in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold  the testing for recoverability under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  of a significant asset group within the segment 
recovery of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net book value of long term assets including amortizable intangible assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
in such circumstances an impairment loss would be recorded equal to the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds fair value 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
bad debt allowance estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable by aging category 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by management with the assistance of a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by reference to past claims experience  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
income tax accruals we record income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and 
table of contents liabilities  calculated using currently enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
we account for income tax uncertainties under fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides guidance on the recognition  de recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions 
we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
evaluating and estimating our uncertain tax positions and tax benefits is based on our judgment 
if our judgments and estimates are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
we are subject to examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities 
the internal revenue code irc and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions 
tax positions taken may be subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and regulatory matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
consistent with sfas no 
 we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities 
management s assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
we accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if a contingent liability is only reasonably possible  we will disclose the potential range of the loss  if estimable 
actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by their nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  result of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
stock based compensation effective may   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  for our share based compensation plans 
we previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb no 
and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  all share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
prior periods are not restated 

table of contents consistent with prior years  we used the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation  including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate volatility we had interest rate risk relating to approximately million of the current maturities of long term debt at april  the interest rate on the variable rate portion of this debt was approximately at april  should the average interest rate on the variable rate portion of this debt change by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by million 
the remainder of the current maturities of long term debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk 
this includes million at fixed rates through interest rate swaps and collars 
commodity price volatility through its fcr recycling operation  we market a variety of materials  including fibers such as occ cardboard and onp newspaper  plastics  glass  ferrous and aluminum metals 
we use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from commodity price fluctuations such as indexed purchases  floor prices  fixed price agreements  and revenue share arrangements 
in addition  as of april  we are party to commodity hedge contracts that manage pricing fluctuations on a portion of our occ and onp volumes 
these contracts expire between june and december we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we expect to be able to replace our expiring hedges with existing or new counterparties  however  the availability and pricing terms at any given time will be subject to prevailing market conditions 
if commodity prices were to have changed by in the year ended april   the impact on our operating income is estimated at between million and million based on the observed impact of commodity price changes on operating income margin during the years ended april  and april  our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices is complex because each customer contract is unique relative to revenue sharing  tipping or processing fees and other arrangements 
the above estimated ranges of operating income impact may not be indicative of future operating results and actual results may vary materially
