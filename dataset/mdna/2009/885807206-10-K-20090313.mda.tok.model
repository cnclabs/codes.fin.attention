item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of drugs targeting the microenvironment of solid tumors as novel treatments for patients living with cancer 
the microenvironment of solid tumors is characterized by  among other things  hypoxia or lack of oxygen  disordered blood vessel growth  and the upregulation of glucose transport 
this hypoxic environment is known to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation 
it is thought to be responsible for the poor prognosis of many solid tumors and treating the hypoxic environment is currently believed to be a significant unmet medical need 
our product candidates are designed to selectively target the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors either by selective toxin activation in the case of our hypoxia activated prodrug hap program  including th  or potentially utilizing the consequences of increased uptake of glucose in cancer cells relative to most normal cells 
our product candidates glufosfamide and dg share certain structural characteristics with glucose but act instead as chemotherapeutic toxins when taken up by a cell 
our focus is on product candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer 
we have three product candidates for which we have exclusive worldwide marketing rights th  which we discovered  is our lead product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer 
it is a novel drug candidate that is activated under the severe hypoxic conditions of most solid tumors 
in may  we announced the filing of an ind with the fda for th  and in july  we initiated a phase clinical trial evaluating the safety of th in patients with advanced solid tumors 
in october  we reported interim results for this clinical trial 
in the first quarter of we expanded enrollment to explore activity in specific indications and expect to provide top line results in the second quarter of in august  we initiated a multi armed phase clinical trial of th which includes three separate treatment arms with each arm combining th with a different chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with solid tumors 
in september  we also initiated a phase clinical trial of th in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma 
we expect to provide interim results for the two trials in the second quarter of and we expect to complete enrollment in the fourth quarter of glufosfamide is for the potential treatment of patients with cancer 
in february  we announced that our phase clinical trial did not reach its primary endpoint of a statistically significant survival benefit for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that relapsed following chemotherapy with gemcitabine 
in may  we completed the phase study and we are conducting no further clinical trials at this time 
we plan to partner or seek external funding for the future development of glufosfamide 
dg is our product candidate for the potential treatment of patients with cancer and has been evaluated in a phase clinical trial alone and in combination with docetaxel as a combination therapy 
this clinical trial began in the first quarter of and we completed enrollment in the first half of we presented top line results for this clinical trial in august we are not currently planning or conducting any additional clinical trials of dg 
we plan to partner or seek external funding for the future development of dg 
we are working to discover additional hypoxia activated prodrugs that will selectively target cancer cells 

table of contents we are a development stage company incorporated in october we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates  and prior to our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations through the private placement of equity securities 
in february  we completed our initial public offering that raised net proceeds of million  and in october  we completed an offering of common stock that raised net proceeds of million 
in august  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of million 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  respectively  and the cumulative net loss since our inception through december  was million 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and beginning of new clinical trials 
we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the first quarter of  including completing our current ongoing clinical trials and conducting research and discovery efforts toward additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the progress and results of our clinical trials 
revenue we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of our product candidates in the near term 
through  we recognized million in revenue related to the upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
the payment was contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan  which occurred in july revenue has been recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  through december  we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of conducting clinical trials  salaries and related costs for personnel including non cash stock based compensation  costs of clinical materials  costs for research projects and preclinical studies  costs related to regulatory filings  and facility costs 
contracting and consulting expenses are a significant component of our research and development expenses as we rely on consultants and contractors in many of these areas 
we recognize expenses as they are incurred 
our accruals for expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and contracts associated with clinical materials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of services provided and the status of the activities 
we expect annual research and development expenses will decrease significantly in the future as we progress with a reduced workforce and smaller clinical trials 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on research and development expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in the executive  finance  patent  accounting and other administrative functions  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as consulting costs for functions for which we either do not staff or only partially staff  including public relations  market research and recruiting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on general and administrative expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  except for options granted prior to our initial public offering in february  for which the fair value was determined for disclosure purposes using the minimum value method 
refer to the discussion of accounting treatment of stock based compensation below under critical accounting policies 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
revenue was recognized on a straight line basis through  the development period 
we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in expenses is due to a million decrease in clinical and development expenses  million in lower staffing and facilities expenses due to a lower headcount compared to the prior year and million in lower consulting expenses 
staffing expenses in included million in severance expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to a reduction in the number of employees and consultants compared to the prior year  as well as lower valuations for stock option grants resulting from a lower stock price 
research and development expenses by project in thousands years ended december  th glufosfamide dg discovery research th total research and development expenses research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million for and million for the increase of million was primarily due to in employee related expenses and million in clinical and manufacturing expenses 
th continues to progress through the phase monotherapy clinical trial initiated in july  with enrollment completed in the fourth quarter of in addition  in the third quarter of  we initiated a phase combination therapy clinical trial of th which includes three separate treatment arms and a phase clinical trial of th in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma 
research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for and million for this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in clinical and manufacturing expenses  a million decrease in employee related and stock compensation expenses and a million decrease in outside consulting expenses 
these declines in expenses were due to completion and announcement of results for our phase trials in pancreatic cancer and soft tissue sarcoma in and discontinuation of our phase trials in recurrent sensitive small cell lung cancer and platinum resistant ovarian cancer in october and january  respectively 
research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for  as we completed enrollment of our dg phase trial in second quarter of and announced results in third quarter 
table of contents of we are not currently planning or conducting any additional clinical trials of dg 
we plan to partner or seek external funding for the future development of dg 
discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for the decrease was primarily due to the allocation of resources towards our th program  and lower staffing and facilities expenses to support our other discovery research programs 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and beginning of new clinical trials 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million decrease reflects million in lower staffing and facilities expense  million decrease in stock based compensation  and million in lower consulting expenses 
staffing expenses in included million in severance expenses 
we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to remain approximately flat in compared to interest and other income interest and other income for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during compared to the prior year 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue related to a million upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  currently estimated to be through we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in expenses is due to a million decrease in clinical and development expenses and million in lower staffing and facilities expenses due to a lower headcount compared to the prior year 
in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased by million primarily due to a reduction in the number of employees and consultants compared to the prior year  as well as lower valuations for stock option grants resulting from a lower stock price 
research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide were million for and million for this decrease was due to a million decrease in clinical and manufacturing expenses and a 
table of contents million decrease in staffing expenses 
research and development expenses associated with our internally discovered compound th were million for and million for  primarily due to the compound s progress through preclinical studies towards the ind filing in april and commencement of the phase clinical trial in july research and development expenses associated with dg were million for and million for  due to million decrease in employee related expenses and a million decrease in clinical and manufacturing as the phase clinical trial nears completion 
discovery research and development expenses were million for and million for the decrease was primarily due to the allocation of resources towards our th program  and lower staffing and facilities expenses to support our other discovery research programs 
research and development expenses associated with th were  for and million for this decrease in expenses was due to costs associated with fully enrolled clinical trials in the period  followed by the discontinuation and close out of the program beginning in july for  our payments were less than previously estimated accruals 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the million decrease reflects million in lower staffing expense  million decrease in stock based compensation  and million in lower consulting expenses 
these reductions in expenses were partially offset by million in higher facilities expense 
interest and other income interest and other income for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates during compared to the prior year 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses since inception through december  of million 
we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of product candidates in the near term 
from inception until our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of our preferred stock 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of million shares of our common stock  raising net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
in august  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to per share and warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price equal to per share subject to adjustment 
we received aggregate gross proceeds of million in connection with the offering 
net proceeds generated from the offering were million 
in august  our board of directors approved a for reverse split of its common stock  effective august  accordingly  all references to common shares of stock have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse split 
we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash used in 
table of contents operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expenses  offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations was attributable to the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expenses  a decrease in accrued liabilities and a decrease in deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   cash used in operations resulted from the net loss for the year after adding back non cash charges for stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expenses and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by purchases of marketable securities of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of million  capital spending of million  partially offset by sales of marketable securities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting the million net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in august  offset by repayments of notes payable totaling for the year 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to repayments of notes payable during the year partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which was primarily attributable to borrowings under a loan and security agreement  net of repayments and to lesser extent cash from stock option exercises and sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
we expect cash requirements to be in the range of million to million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the first quarter of  including completing our current trials  conducting research and discovery efforts towards additional product candidates  working capital and general corporate purposes 
we expect to need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our future operations 
we may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements  and or public or private debt 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on our clinical and regulatory events  our ability to identify promising in licensing opportunities  and factors related to financial  economic  and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  any of which could delay or require that we curtail our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 

table of contents in addition  our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our stock being quoted on the nasdaq capital market 
previously we had fallen out of compliance with continued listing requirements because our common stock did not comply with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a 
on august  our board of directors implemented a one for six reverse stock split  effective august   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on september   the nasdaq stock market notified us that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price 
even though we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in the future  and our failure to do so could result in the delisting of our shares from the nasdaq capital market 
to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market  we are also required  among other things  to either maintain stockholders equity of at least million or a market value of at least million 
while we currently satisfy the stockholders equity requirement  we may not continue to do so 
on october   the nasdaq stock market suspended the enforcement of the minimum bid price and market value requirements through january  and on december   the suspension period was extended to april  if we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our activities  and if we are unable to obtain additional funding  there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence 
obligations and commitments in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow up to million for working capital and equipment purchases 
as of december   we had borrowed the full amount under this facility  which is being repaid over a month period from the dates of borrowing 
these borrowings bear interest at an average rate of per year at december  at december   all borrowing under this facility had been fully repaid 
in april  we amended the existing loan and security agreement to borrow up to an additional million for working capital and equipment purchases 
the interest rate for borrowings under this facility will be determined based on the month us treasury note plus on the date of borrowing 
we borrowed million under this facility  which will be repaid over a month period from the date of borrowing 
the interest rate on these borrowings was approximately per annum 
at december   the total amount due under this facility was million 
we may borrow up to an additional million for equipment purchases 
the amended agreement requires us to maintain the lower of of our total cash and cash equivalents or million at the financial institution 
at december   we were in compliance with this covenant 
in august  we entered into a noncancelable facilities sublease agreement that expires on february  for our headquarters in redwood city  california 
on april   we entered into a noncancelable facilities lease agreement that expires on february  for additional laboratory space in redwood city  california 
in february  we entered into a lease for an additional  square feet of space and increased the lease term for the existing space located at our headquarters in redwood city  california to september  the lease is for a period of months  beginning on april  with respect to the additional square footage and will begin on march  with respect to the existing square footage 
the lease will expire  unless otherwise terminated under the terms of the lease  on september  the aggregate rent for the term of the lease is approximately million 

table of contents in addition  the lease requires us to pay certain taxes  assessments  fees and other costs and expenses associated with the premises as well as a customary management fee 
we are also responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the leased space 
in connection with the lease  we furnished a letter of credit to the landlord for approximately million 
our major outstanding contractual obligations consist of amounts due under our financing and lease agreements  and purchase commitments 
contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of december   are as follows in thousands within one year one to three years four to five years after five years total facilities sublease and lease notes payable  principal and interest purchase commitments total in november  we entered into an agreement with medibic to develop glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries  and received an upfront payment of million contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan 
in july  we finalized the development plan with medibic and began recognizing revenue from the upfront payment on a straight line basis over the development period  through december  we are responsible for all development activities under this agreement 
we will also be required to make royalty payments upon product commercialization 
we may terminate the agreement at any time by making certain payments ranging from million to million  depending on the stage of development of the glufosfamide product in japan 
in august  we entered into an agreement with baxter for the licensing and development of glufosfamide 
under this agreement  we paid baxter an upfront license fee of million and a million development milestone in we also made a development milestone payment of million in november and we are obligated to make certain additional development milestone payments  with the next payment due in connection with the filing of a new drug application with the fda for glufosfamide 
we will be required to make a milestone payment of million within days of filing an nda for glufosfamide with the fda 
future milestone payments in connection with the development of glufosfamide and united states and foreign regulatory submissions could total up to million  and sales based milestone payments could total up to million 
following regulatory approval  we will be obligated to pay up to mid single digit royalties to baxter based on sales of glufosfamide products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make development or sales based milestone or royalty payments to baxter 
under our license agreement with dr 
theodore j 
lampidis and dr 
waldemar priebe for rights under a patent and certain patent applications that generally cover the treatment of cancer with dg in combination with certain other cancer drugs  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments  including milestone payments of up to million in connection with the filing and approval of an nda for the first product covered by the licensed patents  as well as royalties based on sales of such products 
we cannot be certain when  if ever  we will have to make these milestone or royalty payments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

table of contents income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million in both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations on annual utilization in case of changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax laws 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and california state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in through the california state research credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss or research credit carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning on january   we began accounting for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our employee stock purchase plan under the provisions of sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of our common stock for options granted through the date of the initial public offering in february was originally estimated by our board of directors  with input from management 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist 
subsequently  we reassessed the 
table of contents valuations of common stock relating to grants of options during the period from january  through the date of our initial public offering and the years ended december  and as disclosed more fully in note of the notes of our consolidated financial statements  we granted stock options and restricted common stock with exercise prices ranging from to per share during the period from january  through the date of our initial public offering and the years ended december  and in addition  we determined that the fair value of our common stock increased from to per share during that period 
for financial reporting purposes  we have recorded stock based compensation representing the difference between the estimated fair value of common stock and the option exercise price 
because shares of our common stock were not publicly traded before our initial public offering in february  we determined the estimated fair value based upon several factors  including significant milestones attained  sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  changes in valuations of existing comparable publicly registered biotech companies  trends in the broad market for biotechnology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in an initial public offering 
although it was reasonable to expect that the completion of our initial public offering would add value to the shares as a result of increased liquidity and marketability  the amount of additional value could not be measured with precision or certainty 
we amortize employee stock based compensation on a straight line basis for equity instruments subject to fixed accounting 
we amortize employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans for equity instruments subject to variable accounting 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods  or services 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock 
the two factors which most affect these changes are the fair value of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of such fair value 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments change  it would have the effect of changing compensation expenses 
preclinical and clinical trial accruals most of our preclinical and clinical trials are performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical supplies are manufactured by contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos 
invoicing from these third parties may be monthly based upon services performed or based upon milestones achieved 
we accrue these expenses based upon our assessment of the status of each clinical trial and the work completed  and upon information obtained from the cros and cmos 
our estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by the cros and cmos regarding the status and cost of the studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
to date we have had no significant adjustments 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based upon the levels of inputs described below  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 

table of contents we adopted fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas in the first quarter of sfas defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
sfas also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
our short term investments primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
sfas no 
requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
if a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy  the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation 
our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include securities available for sale 
securities available for sale include money market funds  government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
accounting for income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets  as based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  to partially defer sfas fsp defers the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november  we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of and are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the provisions of fsp on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  which would qualify as a scope exception under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted 
the adoption of eitf will result in the reclassification of our outstanding warrants from stockholders equity to liability  which will require the warrants to be marked to market at each reporting period  with the changes in market value recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
at december   we had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market funds and investments in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  which currently have weighted average maturity of less than one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio we believe an increase in the interest rates of one percentage point would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states 
although we conduct some clinical and safety studies  and manufacture some active pharmaceutical product with vendors outside the united states  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly traded marketable securities 
we review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  credit quality and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value
