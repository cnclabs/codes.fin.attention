in the second quarter of  the company completed its analysis of the impact of making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime 
the analysis illustrated that using the tonnage tax method would reduce the company s cash outlay related to federal income taxes 
for federal tax purposes  the company can satisfy only of its amt alternative minimum taxable income with its net operating loss carryforwards nol and  therefore  results in a much larger cash outlay in comparison to the required payments associated with the tonnage tax regime 
as a result of this analysis  the company determined that it would be making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime on its federal tax return

therefore during the second quarter of  the deferred tax asset was adjusted by approximately million to reflect this limitation 
the remaining deferred tax asset at december  and of approximately  and  respectively  represents primarily the state portion of the company s deferred tax asset 
the company s research of the tonnage tax suggests that states do not recognize the tonnage tax and  therefore  nol s related to state qualifying shipping income would not be suspended 
the election of the tonnage tax was made in connection with the filing of the company s federal corporate income tax return and will also apply to all subsequent federal income tax returns unless the company revokes this tax treatment 
the company is accounting for this election as a change in status of its qualifying shipping activities 
as a result of the change in status  federal deferred tax assets and liabilities  including approximately million of federal nol s  which were previously offset by a valuation allowance  have been suspended 
it cannot be assured that there will not be future efforts to repeal all  or any portion of  the tonnage tax as it applies to our shipping activities

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
page 
table of contents the company s most critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in progress  voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method 
voyage expenses are recognized as incurred 
fuel and other surcharges  demurrage and charterhire revenue are included in our revenues 
net demurrage is a charge assessed for failure to return empty freight equipment on time less a demurrage related allowance for bad debt 
charter hire is rental revenue for vessels not in use in a liner service 
the company recognizes demurrage and charterhire revenue based on negotiated fees included in the contracts of our customers 
these amounts are computed daily and included in operating revenue 
useful life and salvage values 
the company reviews the selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating our property and equipment 
depreciable lives of property and equipment range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sales are based on the expected values of equipment at the time of disposal 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately  the gain or losses on the disposal of the asset 
repairs and maintenance 
the company expenses repairs and maintenance as incurred 
every five years the company s vessels are required to go through regulatory dry docking 
the company elected  in a prior year  to account for its dry docking costs using the expense as incurred method as opposed to the defer and amortize method predominantly used by the company s industry peer group 
the company elected the expense as incurred method for accounting for these required regulatory dry docking costs as it is the method preferred by the securities and exchange commission 
using the expense as incurred method  the company recorded   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
had the company used the defer and amortize method such expenses would have been amortized over the five year period between regulatory dry dockings 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to our carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  the company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  replacement costs of such assets  business plans and overall market conditions 
the company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows and compares it to the carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  the company would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value primarily through the use of appraisals or other valuation techniques 
the company recognized no impairments in  or uncollectible accounts 
the company records a monthly provision based on specific known collectability problems  historical losses  and current economic information 
in addition  the company performs an analysis of the total receivables on a quarterly basis  including review of historical collection trends  and adjusts the provision account each quarter 
it is the company s policy to write off receivables once it is determined that additional efforts of collection will not result in the collection of the receivable 
income taxes 
the american jobs creation act of instituted an elective tonnage tax regime whereby a corporation may elect to pay a tonnage tax based upon the net tonnage of its qualifying us flag vessels rather than the traditional us corporate income tax on the taxable income from such vessels and related inland service 
the company has determined that its marine operations and inland transportation related page 
table of contents to marine operations qualify for the tonnage tax 
in the second quarter of  the company completed its analysis of the impact of making the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime 
the analysis illustrated that using the tonnage tax method would reduce the company s cash outlay related to federal income taxes  for federal tax purposes  the company can satisfy only of its alternative minimum taxable amt income with its net operating loss carryforwards nol s and  therefore  results in a much larger cash outlay in comparison to the required payments associated with the tonnage tax regime 
as a result of this analysis  the company made the election to be taxed under the tonnage tax regime on its federal tax return 
the federal tax expense related to under the tonnage tax method is estimated to be approximately  the remaining deferred tax asset of approximately  represents the state portion of the company s deferred tax asset 
the company s research of the tonnage tax suggests that states do not recognize the tonnage tax and  therefore  nol s related to state qualifying shipping income would not be suspended 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  fin in the first quarter of fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions 
the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recognized the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the company s financial statements 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the company performed a review of its uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin and concluded that there were no significant adjustments required related to uncertain tax positions 
as of the adoption date  the company had no accrued interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
interest and penalties  if incurred  would be recognized as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   there has been no change to the assessment as of the adoption date 
the company does not believe there will be any material changes in its unrecognized position over the next months 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and each state jurisdiction in which it operates which imposes an income tax 
the company has not been subject to internal revenue service irs examination of its federal income tax returns 
the company is not currently involved in any state income tax examination 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with less management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

revised  business combinations 
this standard establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
this standard also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect that the implementation of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
united states generally accepted accounting principles has required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which it has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas had no material impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
for the company  sfas is effective for the fiscal year beginning after november   however  the fasb has deferred the implementation of the provision of sfas relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities until january  the adoption of sfas had no material impact on the company s financial statements
