item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview introduction thomas betts corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of electrical components used in industrial  construction  retail  utility and communications markets 
we are also a leading producer of highly engineered steel structures  used primarily for utility transmission  and commercial heating units 
we have operations in approximately countries 
manufacturing  marketing and sales activities are concentrated primarily in north america and europe 
thomas betts had another successful year in  despite the economic turmoil that began in the second half of the year 
during  we faced fluctuating commodity costs  competitive pricing pressures and softening demand  especially in our domestic markets 
the current economic environment has adversely affected demand in our primary markets and we responded swiftly and decisively in to minimize the impact of the economic downturn as it began to spread beyond the residential related markets 
since mid  we have reduced our employee headcount by approximately 
each of our segments performed well notwithstanding the challenging current year environment 
we completed two acquisitions in early and have essentially completed the integration of the and acquisitions 
these acquisitions played a major role in the significant and increases in net sales and gross profit over the respective prior year 
net earnings from continuing operations in benefited by the gain on sale of our minority interest in leviton manufacturing company 
finally  during  we completed planned divestures of non core pipe businesses acquired as part of the acquisition of lamson sessions co 
the challenges encountered in the second half of are expected to have a deepening impact on refer to our outlook for a further discussion 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales  costs  expenses  assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we recognize revenue for service agreements over the applicable service periods 
sales discounts  quantity and price rebates  and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
quantity rebates are in the form of volume incentive discount plans  which include specific sales volume targets or year over year sales volume growth targets for specific customers 
certain distributors can take advantage of price rebates by subsequently reselling our products into targeted construction projects or markets 
following a distributor s sale of an eligible product  the distributor submits a claim for a price rebate 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts when credit losses are both probable and estimable 
a number of distributors  primarily in our electrical segment  have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns  which are reasonably estimable  are accrued as page of 
table of contents a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment 
we analyze historical returns and allowances  current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventories 
we also periodically perform an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items 
such evaluations are based on management s judgment and use of estimates 
such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand  aging of the inventory  sales forecasts for particular product groupings  planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas no 
 all assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles  are recorded at fair value 
the initial recording of goodwill and other intangibles requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
goodwill consists principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is not amortized 
for each amortizable intangible asset  we use a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed 
if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  the straight line amortization method is used 
we also follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent interim assessments 
in evaluating when an interim assessment is necessary  we consider  among other things  the trading level of our common stock  changes in expected future cash flows and mergers and acquisitions involving companies in our industry 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 each test of goodwill requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
sfas no 
defines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of three valuation methods market multiple approach  discounted cash flow approach  and comparable transactions approach 
the market multiple approach provides indications of value based on market multiples for public companies involved in similar lines of business 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of projected future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
the comparable transactions approach provides indications of value based on an examination of recent transactions in which companies in similar lines of business were acquired 
the fair values derived from these three valuation methods are then blended to arrive at a single value for each reporting unit 
our determination of fair values as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of involved a weighting of to the market multiple approach  to the discounted cash flow approach and to the comparable transactions approach 
we then reconcile the total values for all reporting units to our market capitalization and evaluate the reasonableness of the implied control premium 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and we must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the page of 
table of contents reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
methods used to determine fair values for indefinite lived intangible assets involve customary valuation techniques that are applicable to the particular class of intangible asset and apply inputs and assumptions that we believe a market participant would use 
our annual assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of of intangible assets with indefinite lives concluded that the fair value of such assets in the electrical segment were impaired by million 
additionally  our annual assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
circumstances subsequent to the annual assessment did not warrant us performing an interim review of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets  we evaluate assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for associated product groups 
we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
indications of impairment require significant judgment by management 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
when fair values are not available  we estimate fair values using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
for purposes of calculating pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs  we use certain actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these assumptions annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors retirement patterns  mortality and turnover  rate of compensation increase and the healthcare cost trend rate 
see additional information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations qualified pension plans 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between page of 
table of contents book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and requires an evaluation of asset realizability based on a more likely than not criteria 
we have valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign income tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  based on enacted tax laws in effect as of december   will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances 
environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of currently available facts related to each site 
the operation of manufacturing plants involves a high level of susceptibility in these areas  and there is no assurance that we will not incur material environmental or occupational health and safety liabilities in the future 
moreover  expectations of remediation expenses could be affected by  and potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with  environmental regulations and health and safety laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future 
future remediation technology advances could adversely impact expectations of remediation expenses 
outlook we expect the current economic environment will negatively impact our primary markets during a significant portion of  with the impact being most prominent on the first half of we expect total company net sales to decline by to year over year 
electrical segment net sales are expected to decline year over year by to  with foreign currency negatively impacting net sales by approximately and net volume contributing to the remaining to of the deterioration 
additionally  we expect to experience lower volumes in nearly all geographical and product markets  with the us market deteriorating much more significantly than other geographic regions we cover 
in the steel structures segment  we expect low double digit sales growth  driven by volume and higher comparable steel prices 
we expect a mid single digit sales decline in the hvac segment that is primarily volume related 
we expect diluted per share earnings in the range of to for the full year full year earnings guidance assumptions include depreciation and capital spending of million each  corporate expenses of million million per quarter  share based compensation of million  acquisition related amortization of million  interest expense of million  an effective tax rate of approximately and million fully diluted average shares outstanding 
additionally  our guidance reflects approximately million in benefits from the acquisition integration efforts undertaken in  although this will be entirely offset by higher pension costs 
the key risk factors we may face in include the impact on our primary markets from a prolonged disruption in credit markets and the negative impact on credit availability  excessive fluctuation in foreign currencies versus the us dollar  volatility in commodity costs and availability and additional or heightened slowdowns in key market segments and geographic regions
