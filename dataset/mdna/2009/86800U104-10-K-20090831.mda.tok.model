item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell application optimized  high performance server solutions based on an innovative  modular and open standard x architecture 
our solutions include a range of complete rackmount and blade server systems  as well as components which can be used by distributors  oems and end customers to assemble server systems 
to date  we have generated the majority of our net sales from components 
since  we have gradually shifted our focus and resources to designing  developing  manufacturing and selling application optimized server systems 
in recent years our growth in net sales has been driven by the growth in the market for application optimized server systems 
for fiscal years  and  net sales of optimized servers were million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal year  we experienced a decline in net sales compared with fiscal year which we believe was primarily attributable to reductions in information technology spending in response to the global economic downturn 
we commenced operations in and have been profitable every year since inception 
for fiscal years  and  our net sales were million  million and million  respectively  and our net income was million  million and million  respectively 
our decline in profitability in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the reduction in our net sales and to a lesser extent attributable to a reduction in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales as a result of increasing pricing pressure  offset in part by cost saving programs 
we sell our server systems and components primarily through distributors and to a lesser extent to oems as well as through our direct sales force 
for fiscal years  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors  and we derived approximately  and  respectively  from sales to oems and to end customers 
none of our customers accounted for or more of our net sales in fiscal years  or for fiscal years  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from customers in the united states 
for fiscal years  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales from customers outside the united states 
we perform the majority of our research and development efforts in house 
for fiscal years  and  research and development expenses represented approximately  and of our net sales  respectively 
we use several suppliers and contract manufacturers to design and manufacture components in accordance with our specifications  with most final assembly and testing performed at our manufacturing facility in san jose  california 
this arrangement enables us to maintain our cost structure and to benefit from our suppliers and contract manufacturers research and development and economies of scale 
one of our key suppliers is ablecom  a related party  which supplies us with contract design and manufacturing support 
for fiscal years  and  our purchases from ablecom represented approximately  and of our cost of sales  respectively 
the decrease in percentage of cost of sales was primarily related to higher product mix of server systems and system accessories which were purchased from other suppliers 
ablecom s sales to us constitute a substantial majority of ablecom s net sales 
we continue to maintain our manufacturing relationship with ablecom in asia in an effort to reduce our product costs and do not have any current plans to reduce our reliance on ablecom product purchases 
in addition to providing a larger 
table of contents volume of contract manufacturing services for us  ablecom continues to warehouse for us a number of components and subassemblies manufactured by multiple suppliers prior to shipment to our facilities in the us and europe 
we typically negotiate the price of products that we purchase from ablecom on a quarterly basis  however  either party may re negotiate the price of products with each order 
as a result of our relationship with ablecom  it is possible that ablecom may in the future sell products to us at a price higher or lower than we could obtain from an unrelated third party supplier 
this may result in our future reporting of gross profit as a percentage of net sales that is less than or in excess of what we might have obtained absent our relationship with ablecom 
in order to continue to increase our net sales and profits  we believe that we must continue to develop flexible and customizable server solutions and be among the first to market with new features and products 
we measure our financial success based on various indicators  including growth in net sales  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  operating income as a percentage of net sales  levels of inventory  and days sales outstanding  or dsos 
in connection with these efforts  we monitor daily and weekly sales and shipment reports 
among the key non financial indicators of our success is our ability to rapidly introduce new products and deliver the latest application optimized server solutions 
in this regard  we work closely with microprocessor and other component vendors to take advantage of new technologies as they are introduced 
historically  our ability to introduce new products rapidly has allowed us to benefit from the introduction of new microprocessors and as a result we monitor the introduction cycles of intel and amd carefully 
this also impacts our research and development expenditures 
for example  intel recently introduced its nehalem line of microprocessors 
our results for the quarter ended march  were in part adversely impacted by customer order delays in anticipation of the introduction and research and development expenditures necessary for us to prepare for the introduction 
subsequently  we benefited from the introduction with an increase in sales of these products for the quarter ended june  we also solicit input from our customers to understand their future needs as we design and develop our products 
other financial highlights the following is a summary of other financial highlights of fiscal year we generated cash flows from operations of million  million and million in fiscal year  and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments  were million at the end of fiscal year  compared with million at the end of fiscal year we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal year days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso at the end of fiscal year was days  compared with days at the end of fiscal year our inventory balance was million at the end of fiscal year  compared with million at the end of fiscal year days sales of inventory dsi at the end of fiscal year was days  compared with days at the end of fiscal year our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were million at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of fiscal year we believe that our cash position  our balance sheet  our visibility into our supply chain and our financing capabilities provide a key competitive advantage and position us well to manage through the current economic downturn 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on june references to fiscal year  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents revenues and expenses net sales 
net sales consist of sales of our server solutions  including server systems and components 
the main factors which impact our net sales are unit volumes shipped and average selling prices 
the prices for server systems range widely depending upon the configuration  and the prices for our components vary based on the type of component 
as with most electronics based products  average selling prices typically are highest at the time of introduction of new products which utilize the latest technology and tend to decrease over time as such products mature in the market and are replaced by next generation products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of the costs to manufacture our products  including the costs of materials  contract manufacturing  shipping  personnel and related expenses  equipment and facility expenses  warranty costs and inventory excess and obsolete provisions 
the primary factors that impact our cost of sales are the mix of products sold and cost of materials  which include raw material costs  shipping costs and salary and benefits related to production 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales may increase over time if decreases in average selling prices are not offset by corresponding decreases in our costs 
our cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  is generally lower on server systems than on components 
because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements  our cost of sales is subject to change based on market conditions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of the personnel and related expenses of our research and development teams  and materials and supplies  consulting services  third party testing services and equipment and facility expenses related to our research and development activities 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we occasionally receive non recurring engineering  or nre funding from certain suppliers and customers towards our development efforts 
under these programs  we are reimbursed for certain research and development costs that we incur as part of the joint development of our products and those of our suppliers and customers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related research and development expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales and marketing personnel  costs for tradeshows  independent sales representative fees and marketing programs 
from time to time  we receive cooperative marketing funding from certain suppliers 
under these programs  we are reimbursed for certain marketing costs that we incur as part of the joint promotion of our products and those of our suppliers 
these amounts offset a portion of the related expenses and have the effect of reducing our reported sales and marketing expenses 
similarly  we from time to time offer our distributors cooperative marketing funding which has the effect of increasing our expenses 
the timing  magnitude and estimated usage of our programs and those of our suppliers can result in significant variations in reported sales and marketing expenses from period to period 
spending on cooperative marketing  either by us or our suppliers  typically increases in connection with significant product releases by us or our suppliers 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of general corporate costs  including personnel expenses  financial reporting  corporate governance and compliance and outside legal  audit and tax fees 
reversal of litigation loss 
loss from litigation relates to an action filed in france by digitechnic  sa  a former customer  alleging that certain products purchased from us were defective 
in september  the court found in favor of digitechnic and awarded damages totaling million 
in february  the court of appeals dismissed the claims 
digitechnic appealed the decision to the french supreme court and asked for million for damages 
on february   the french supreme court reversed the decision of the paris court of appeals  ordering a new hearing before a different panel of the paris court of appeals 
a new hearing was conducted on june  we expect that the decision of the court of appeals will be rendered in the quarter ending december  although we cannot predict with certainty the final outcome of this litigation  we believe the claims to be without merit and intend to continue to defend against them vigorously 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 

table of contents we accrued million in fiscal year for the payment of estimated fines related to export control matters arising in prior years 
in fiscal year  we entered into settlement agreements regarding certain claims relating to the violation of export control laws 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net represents the net of our interest income on investments or interest expense on the building loans for our owned facilities offset by interest earned on our cash balances 
income tax provision 
our income tax provision is based on our taxable income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate  currently primarily the united states and the netherlands and to a lesser extent  taiwan 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to releasing of unrecognized tax liability on research and development credits resulting from lapsing statues of limitations  tax benefit of tax exempt interest income  research and development tax credits and the domestic production activities deduction 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  cooperative marketing accruals  investment valuations  inventory valuations  income taxes  warranty obligations and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments we make about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because these estimates can vary depending on the situation  actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they require our more significant judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we account for revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
under the provisions of sab no 
 we recognize revenue from sales of products  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred and title has transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and all significant obligations have been met 
generally this occurs at the time of shipment when risk of loss and title has passed to the customer 
our standard arrangement with our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  free on board shipping point terms  except for a few customers who have free on board destination terms  and revenue is recognized when the products arrive at the destination  to days payment terms  and no customer acceptance provisions 
we generally do not provide for non warranty rights of return except for products which have out of box failure  where customers could return these products for credit within days of receiving the items 
certain distributors and oems are also permitted to return products in unopened boxes  limited to purchases over a specified period of time  generally within to days of the purchase  or to products in the distributor s or oem s inventory at certain times such as the termination of the agreement or product obsolescence 
in addition  we have a sale arrangement with an oem that has limited product return rights 
to estimate reserves for future sales returns  we regularly review our history of actual returns for each major product line 
we also communicate regularly with our distributors to gather information about end customer satisfaction  and to determine the volume of inventory in the channel 
reserves for future returns are adjusted as necessary  based on returns experience  returns expectations and communication with our distributors 

table of contents probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon the review process  the customers are required to pay cash in advance of shipment 
we also make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivables  analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
we provide for price protection to certain distributors 
we assess the market competition and product technology obsolescence  and make price adjustments based on our judgment 
upon each announcement of price reductions  the accrual for price protection is calculated based on our distributors inventory on hand 
such reserves are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time we reduce the product prices in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
credits that we issued pursuant to these provisions were   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we do not commit to future price reductions with any of our customers 
we have an immaterial amount of service revenue relating to non warranty repairs  which is recognized upon shipment of the repaired units to customers 
service revenue has been less than of net sales for all periods presented and is not separately disclosed 
cooperative marketing accruals 
we follow eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
we have arrangements with resellers of our products to reimburse the resellers for cooperative marketing costs meeting specified criteria 
we accrue the cooperative marketing costs based on these arrangements and our estimate for resellers claims for marketing activities 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we record marketing costs meeting such specified criteria within sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for those marketing costs that do not meet the criteria set forth in eitf issue no 
 the amounts are recorded as a reduction to sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of short term and long term investments 
impairment of short term and long term investments relates to the unrealized loss on the carrying value of our investments in auction rate securities  such securities were rated aaa at the date of purchase 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
we have received all interest payments due on these instruments on a timely basis 
each of these securities has been subject to auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates and the auctions have subsequently failed 
when these securities lost the short term liquidity previously provided by the auction processes  we reclassified these securities as long term investments 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these investments as of june  and the material factors used in preparing the discounted cash flow model are the discount rate utilized to present value the cash flows  the time period until redemption and the estimated rate of return 
management derives the estimates by obtaining input from market data on the applicable discount rate  estimated time to maturity and estimated rate of return 
the changes in fair value have been primarily due to changes in the estimated rate of return and a change in the estimated period to liquidity 
the fair value of our investment portfolio may change between to by increasing or decreasing the rate of return used by or by increasing or decreasing the term used by year 
changes in these estimates or in the market conditions for these investments are likely in the future based upon the then current market conditions for these investments and may affect the fair value of these investments 
as of june  and we have recorded an accumulative unrealized loss of  and  net of deferred income taxes  on the securities  respectively 
we deem this loss to be temporary as we determined that we will not likely be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery and we have the intent to hold our investments until recovery of cost 

table of contents product warranties 
we offer product warranties ranging from to months against any defective product 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized  based on historical warranty experience and recent trends 
we monitor warranty obligations and may make revisions to our warranty reserve if actual costs of product repair and replacement are significantly higher or lower than estimated 
accruals for anticipated future warranty costs are charged to cost of sales and included in accrued liabilities 
the liability for product warranties was million as of june   compared with million as of june  the provision for warranty reserve was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our estimates and assumptions used have been historically close to actual 
the change in estimated liability for pre existing warranties was million  million and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as we experienced an increase in cost of warranty claims in fiscal year compared with our historical experience  the provision for warranty reserve increased million compared to fiscal year as we experienced an increase in cost of warranty claims and higher unit volume in fiscal year compared with our historical experience  the provision for warranty reserve increased million compared to fiscal year if in future periods  we experience or anticipate an increase or decrease in warranty claims as a result of new product introductions or change in unit volumes compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater or lesser than expected  we intend to adjust our estimates appropriately 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventory on a quarterly basis for lower of cost or market and excess and obsolescence and  as necessary  write down the valuation of units to lower of cost or market or for excess and obsolescence based upon the number of units that are unlikely to be sold based upon estimated demand for the following twelve months 
this evaluation takes into account matters including expected demand  anticipated sales price  product obsolescence and other factors 
if actual future demand for our products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or scrapped 
if a unit that has been written down is subsequently sold  the cost associated with the revenue from this unit is reduced to the extent of the write down  resulting in an increase in gross profit 
we monitor the extent to which previously written down inventory is sold at amounts greater or less than carrying value  and based on this analysis  adjust our estimate for determining future write downs 
in fiscal years  and  the historical analysis of sales of previously written down inventory was such that we decreased our estimate for reserving excess and obsolete inventory 
if in future periods  we experience or anticipate a change in recovery rate compared with our historical experience  our gross margin would be affected 
our provision for inventory was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes  net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits measured by applying currently enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
effective july   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors  including changes 
table of contents in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  settlement of issues under audit and new exposures 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the prospective transition method  which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
prior to july   we accounted for stock based compensation awards issued to our employees using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or opinion accordingly  we have recorded compensation expense for stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r with exercise prices less than the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
amortization of deferred stock compensation  resulting from such stock options granted to employees and directors  when the exercise price of our stock options was less than the deemed market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  for the years ended june   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
sfas no 
r supersedes our previous accounting under apb no 
for periods beginning in fiscal year sfas no 
r requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
compensation expense under sfas no 
r for options granted to employees after july   was million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
as of june   the total unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to unvested stock options granted since july  to employees and non employee directors  was million  which is expected to be recognized as an expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using a black scholes option pricing model and a single option award approach 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected forfeiture rate 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on an analysis of the relevant peer companies post vest termination rates and exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on a combination of the implied and historical volatility of our relevant peer group 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires forfeitures of share based awards to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
variable interest entities 
we have analyzed our relationship with ablecom and its subsidiaries and we have concluded that ablecom is a variable interest entity as defined by fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
r  however  we are not the primary beneficiary of ablecom and therefore  we do not consolidate ablecom 
in performing our analysis  we considered our explicit arrangements with ablecom including the supplier and distributor arrangements 
also  as a result of the substantial related party relationship between the two companies  we considered whether any implicit arrangements exist that would cause us to protect those related parties interests in ablecom from 
table of contents suffering losses 
we determined that no implicit arrangements exist with ablecom or its shareholders 
such an arrangement would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duty that we have towards our stockholders who do not own shares in ablecom 
results of operations the following table sets forth our financial results  as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative reversal of litigation loss total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense income before income tax provision income tax provision net income comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales decreased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
this was due primarily to a decrease in unit volumes 
for fiscal year  the approximate number of units sold decreased to million compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in unit volumes was primarily due to a decrease in unit volumes of chassis  serverboards and server systems offset in part by an increase in unit volumes of system accessories 
for fiscal year  the approximate number of server system units sold decreased to  compared to  for fiscal year the average selling price of server system units was approximately  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year growth in the average selling prices of our server systems was principally driven by an increase in average selling prices of oem and bundled server solutions offset in part by declines in average selling prices of series configurations of servers  superblades  series configurations of servers and amd servers 
sales of server systems decreased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily due to lower sales of and series configuration of servers offset in part by higher sales of our oem and bundled server solutions utilizing our high efficiency power supplies and higher sales of superblades 
sales of server systems represented of our net sales for fiscal year as compared to of our net sales for fiscal year we believe that the decline in our net sales in fiscal year was primarily attributable to reductions in information technology spending in response to the global economic downturn and to a lesser extent was impacted by delayed customer orders in anticipation of the release by intel of its nehalem line of microprocessors which were launched at the end of march  for fiscal years and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors and we derived approximately and  respectively  from sales to oems and to end customers 
for fiscal year  customers in the united states  asia  germany and the rest of europe accounted for approximately   and  of our net sales  respectively  as compared to   and  respectively  for fiscal year 
table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars of cost of sales was primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales and a decrease of million in inventory provision  a decrease of million in freight in charges offset in part by an increase of million in provision for warranty reserve 
the higher cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in standard gross margin as a result of lower margins across our product lines due to competitive pricing pressures and our strategy to grow market share during the economic downturn combined with lower prices for our maturing product line in advance of the intel nehalem launch 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the provision for warranty reserve as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the provision for warranty reserve was primarily due to higher repair costs in fiscal year if in future periods we experience or anticipate an increase or decrease in warranty claims as a result of new product introductions or change in unit volumes compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater or lesser than expected  our gross margin would be affected 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the inventory provision as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the decrease in the inventory provision was primarily due to the improvement of our inventory management to reduce excess and slow moving inventory through product conversion and increasing sales efforts 
in fiscal year  the historical analysis of sales of previously written down inventory was such that we decreased our estimate for reserving excess and obsolete inventory 
if in future periods  we experience or anticipate a change in recovery rate compared with our historical experience  our gross margin would be affected 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal years and  respectively 
research and development expenses were of net sales for fiscal year and of net sales for fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars and percentage of sales was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits resulting from growth in research and development personnel  including higher stock based compensation expense offset in part by an increase of million in non recurring engineering funding from certain suppliers and customers 
research and development expenses include stock based compensation expense of million and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the growth in research and development personnel 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses were of net sales for both fiscal years and the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to a decrease of million in cooperative marketing funding to customers and a decrease of million in compensation and benefits offset in part by a decrease of million in cooperative marketing funding from vendors 
sales and marketing expenses include stock based compensation expense of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were of net sales for both fiscal years and the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to a decrease of million in consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley sox compliance and a decrease of million in accrued claims related to a settlement offer of licensing fees offset in part by an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including higher stock based compensation expense and an increase of million in legal expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expenses include stock based compensation expense of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
interest and other expense  net 
interest and other expense  net changed by million  to million of expense from million of income  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  respectively  of which million and million was interest expense for fiscal years and  respectively 
the net change was due to lower interest income of million resulting from lower interest rates 
we expect the interest expenses will decrease in the future as we paid off our outstanding building loans in july and august provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit and the release of an unrecognized tax liability on research and development credits of million resulting from lapsing statues of limitations in fiscal year comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
this was due primarily to an increase in unit volumes and average selling prices 
for the year ended june   the approximate number of units sold increased to million compared to million for the year ended june  growth in unit volumes was primarily due to the growth of x and pd series motherboards and an increase in sales of chassis and accessories such as memory and disk drives offset in part by lower sales of x motherboards 
for the year ended june   the approximate number of server system units sold increased to  compared to  for the year ended june  the average selling price of server system units sold increased to approximately  in fiscal year compared to approximately  in fiscal year growth in the average selling prices of our server systems was principally driven by an increase in sales of our series of server systems  offset in part by declines in average selling prices of more mature products 
sales of server systems increased by million or from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily due to increase in shipments of series configurations of servers and shipments to oem and end customers 
sales of server systems represented of our net sales for fiscal year as compared to of our net sales for fiscal year for fiscal years and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our net sales from products sold to distributors and we derived approximately and  respectively  from sales to oems and to end customers

cost of sales increased by million  or  to million from million  for fiscal years and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars of cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales  higher provision for warranty reserve of million and higher inventory write down of million 
the lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher revenue mix of server systems and newer products 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the provision for warranty reserve as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the provision for warranty reserve was primarily due to higher repair costs in fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded a million expense  or of net sales  related to the write down of excess and obsolete inventory net of benefit from sales of previously written off inventory as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal year the increase in the inventory write down was primarily for our older products including amd ddr products

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
effective july   we adopted certain provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which the financial accounting standards board fasb issued in september sfas establishes specific criteria for the fair value measurement of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are already subject to fair value under current accounting rules 
sfas also requires expanded disclosures related to fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp  which delayed the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november   except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on at least an annual basis 
we elected to delay the adoption date for the portions of sfas impacted by fsp  and  as a result  it adopted a portion of the provisions of sfas the partial adoption of sfas was prospective and did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we are currently evaluating the impact of measuring the remaining nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities under fsp no 
on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
eitf effective july   we adopted eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which the fasb issued in february sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards  which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  an entity may elect to use fair value to measure certain eligible items 
the fair value option may be elected generally on an instrument by instrument basis as long as it is applied to the instrument in its entirety  even if an entity has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
we did not elect to adopt the fair value option on eligible items under sfas fsp in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarified the application of sfas fsp demonstrated how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fsp fas fas effective april   we adopted fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp fas 
fsp fas amends the other than temporary impairment otti guidance in us gaap to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation of other than temporary impairments in the financial statements 
prior to fsp fas  if otti was determined to exist  we recognized an otti charge into earnings in an amount equal to the difference 
table of contents between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value as of the balance sheet date of the reporting period 
under fsp  if otti has been incurred  and it is more likely than not that we will not sell or be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  then the otti is separated into a the amount representing the credit loss and b the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the total otti  which includes both credit and non credit losses  is presented gross in our statements of operations and is reduced by the non credit loss amount of the total otti that is recognized in aoci 
there was no initial effect of adoption on april  as we determined that we will not likely be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery and we have the intent to hold our investments until recovery of cost 
fsp fas effective april   we adopted fsp fas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp fas 
fsp fas provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with sfas when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased 
fsp fas also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly

it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing the risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in money market 
table of contents funds and certificates of deposit 
since our results of operations are not dependent on investments  the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as of june   our investments were in money market funds  certificates of deposits and auction rate securities see liquidity risk below 
we had million of indebtedness under our credit facilities as of june  and million of indebtedness under our credit facilities as of june  the annual interest rate on our credit facilities is based on various indexes as defined in the loan agreements

we paid off the building loans in july and august totaling million including a pre payment penalty of million 
liquidity risk as of june   we held approximately million of auction rate securities  net of unrealized losses  representing our interest in auction rate preferred shares in a closed end mutual fund invested in municipal securities and auction rate student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program  such auction rate securities were rated aaa or bbb at june  these auction rate preferred shares have no stated maturity date and the stated maturity dates for these auction rate student loans range from to during february  the auctions for these auction rate securities began to fail to obtain sufficient bids to establish a clearing rate and were not saleable in the auction  thereby losing the short term liquidity previously provided by the auction process 
as a result  as of june   million of these auction rate securities have been classified as long term available for sale investments 
the remaining million of auction rate student loans was classified as a short term available for sale investment because the stated maturity for this security occurs in june based on our assessment of fair value for fiscal year  we have recorded an accumulated unrealized loss of  net of deferred income taxes  on both long term and short term auction rate securities 
the unrealized loss was deemed to be temporary and has been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in july and august  approximately million of these auction rate securities were redeemed at par 
although we have determined that we will not likely be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery and we have the intent to hold our investments until successful auctions occur  these investments are not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal 
there can be no assurances that these investments will be settled in the short term or that they will not become other than temporarily impaired subsequent to june   as the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
in any event  we do not have a present need to access these funds for operational purposes 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments as there is no assurance as to when the market for these investments will allow us to liquidate them 
we may be required to record impairment charges in periods subsequent to june  with respect to these securities and  if a liquid market does not develop for these investments  we could be required to hold them to maturity 
foreign currency risk to date  our international customer and supplier agreements have been denominated solely in us dollars  and accordingly  we have not been exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from customer agreements  and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  the functional currency of our operations in netherlands and taiwan is the us dollar and our local accounts are maintained in the local currency in the netherlands and taiwan  respectively  and thus we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with re measurement to us dollars 
such fluctuations have not been significant historically 
for example  foreign exchange gain or loss for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively
