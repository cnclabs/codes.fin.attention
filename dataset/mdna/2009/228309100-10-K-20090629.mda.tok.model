item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is a summary of certain factors that management considers important in reviewing the company s results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and operating results 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table contains results of operations for fiscal years and and the dollar and percentage changes for those periods in thousands  except percentages 
fiscal year change change net sales by category bedding  blankets and accessories bibs and bath total net sales cost of products sold gross profit of net sales marketing and administrative expenses of net sales goodwill impairment charge interest expense other income expense income tax expense loss income from continuing operations after taxes discontinued operations net of taxes net loss income of net sales net sales sales of bedding  blankets and accessories increased in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
sales increased by million due to the acquisition of the baby products line of springs global and increased by million due to shipments of new bedding and blanket programs 
these increases were offset by million in lower replenishment orders and million in discontinued programs 
bib and bath sales decreased in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
sales decreased by million due to programs that were discontinued and million in lower replenishment orders and lower sales of seasonal products 
offsetting this decrease was an increase of million related to sales of new designs and promotions and initial program shipments 
gross profit gross profit increased slightly in amount but decreased as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in the percentage is due primarily to increased amortization costs of  in the current year associated with the acquisition of the baby products line of springs global as well as costs of  related to the establishment in late fiscal year of a foreign representative office in china  increased product development and design costs of  and increased testing costs of  in addition  the company has experienced an increase in product costs from asia 
offsetting these increased costs were charges in the prior year of  related to vinyl bibs and  related to the warehousing and shared services agreement entered into in conjunction with the springs global acquisition 
marketing and administrative expenses marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased in amount but decreased as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal year in the current year  the company incurred increased costs for amortization of approximately  related to the acquisition of the baby products line of springs global and  in expenses associated with the governance and standstill 
table of contents agreement entered into on july  with the wynnefield group 
these increases were partially offset by the non recurrence of  of costs incurred in fiscal year associated with the company s proxy contest 
goodwill impairment charge the market capitalization of the company was below its net book value for most of the second half of fiscal year  which the company concluded was a triggering event that required the company to perform an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its reporting units 
as a result of step one of this interim impairment test  the company concluded that the fair values of its two reporting units were below their carrying values  indicating that the goodwill within these reporting units had been impaired 
in step two of the interim impairment test  the goodwill of the reporting units was determined to have no implied value 
accordingly  during fiscal year  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million  which represented the aggregate carrying value of the goodwill of the company s reporting units 
this impairment charge did not have any effect on the cash expenditures of the company and did not have an adverse effect on the covenant calculations under the company s financing agreement or the company s overall compliance with those covenants 
interest expense the increase in interest expense for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to higher revolving line of credit balances and a new term loan executed in conjunction with the acquisition of the baby products line of springs global in november management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations 
the company has traditionally attempted to increase its prices to offset inflation 
there is no assurance  however  that the company will be able to adequately increase its prices in response to inflation 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march   compared to million for the year ended march  the change in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and inventory balances  offset by changes in accounts payable and accrued liability balances 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared million in the prior year 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in the prior year 
net cash used in the current year was primarily for common stock repurchases 
cash provided in the prior year was primarily for net borrowings on the revolving line of credit  offset by payments on long term debt and common stock repurchases 
the company s cash increased from million at march  to million at march   due to management s decision to build up its cash reserves rather than pay down its revolving line of credit 
this decision was made to preserve the company s ability to meet its working capital needs in the event that the company s primary lender should suffer an adverse liquidity event that would jeopardize the company s ability to draw on its revolving line of credit 
as of march   letters of credit of million were outstanding against the million sub limit for letters of credit associated with the company s million revolving line of credit 
based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances as of march   the company had revolving credit availability of million 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay the interest on or to refinance its maturing indebtedness  to fund capital expenditures or to comply with its debt covenants will depend upon future performance 
the company s future performance is  to a certain extent  subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations  the company believes that cash flow from operations  together with revolving credit availability and cash on hand  will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs 

table of contents at march  and march   the company s long term debt consisted of the following in thousands march  march  revolving line of credit term loan non interest bearing notes original issue discount capital leases less current maturities the company s credit facilities at march  consisted of the following revolving line of credit of up to million  including a million sub limit for letters of credit  with an interest rate of prime minus at march  for base rate borrowings or libor plus at march   maturing on july  and secured by a first lien on all assets of the company 
there was a balance of million on the revolving line of credit at march   and the company had million available under the revolving line of credit based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances as of march  as of march   letters of credit of million were outstanding against the million sub limit for letters of credit 
the financing agreement for the million revolving line of credit contains usual and customary covenants for agreements of that type  including limitations on other indebtedness  liens  transfers of assets  investments and acquisitions  merger or consolidation transactions  dividends  transactions with affiliates and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the company and its subsidiaries 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of march  term loan of an original amount of million  with an interest rate of prime plus at march  and requiring equal monthly installments of principal until final maturity on november  subordinated notes of million 
the notes do not bear interest and are due in two equal installments of million each  the first of which is payable on july   and the second of which is payable on july  the original issue discount of million on this non interest bearing obligation at a market interest rate of is being amortized over the life of the notes 
the remaining unamortized balance of million is included in the consolidated balance sheet as of march  annual maturities of the company s credit facilities are as follows in thousands fiscal year revolver term loan sub notes total total to reduce its exposure to credit losses  the company assigns the majority of its trade accounts receivable to a commercial factor 
the company s factor approves customer accounts and credit lines and collects the company s accounts receivable balances 
under the terms of the factoring agreement  which expires on july   the factor remits payments to the company on the average due date of each group of invoices assigned 
if a customer fails to pay the factor by the due date  the company is charged interest at prime less  which was at march   until payment is received 
the company incurred interest expense of  and  in fiscal years 
table of contents and  respectively  as a result of the failure of the company s customers to pay the factor by the due date 
the factor bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved customers that are within approved credit limits 
the company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns  allowances  claims and discounts 
the company s factor may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer 
if such a termination occurs  the company must either assume the credit risks for shipments after the date of such termination or cease shipments to such customer 
critical accounting policies and estimates the listing below  while not inclusive of all of the company s accounting policies  sets forth those accounting policies which the company s management believes embody the most significant judgments due to the uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates are made with respect to the allowances related to accounts receivable for customer deductions for returns  allowances and disputes 
the company also has a certain amount of discontinued finished goods which necessitates the establishment of inventory reserves that are highly subjective 
the company s impairment test for goodwill is based on comparing the fair value of each reporting unit of the company to such reporting unit s carrying value 
fair value is measured using a combination of the income approach  utilizing the discounted cash flow method that incorporates the company s estimates of future revenues and costs  and the public company comparables approach  utilizing multiples of profit measures 
the estimates that the company uses to measure goodwill are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its operations and are based on the best information available as of the date of the measurement 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition sales are recorded when goods are shipped to customers and are reported net of allowances for estimated returns and allowances in the consolidated statements of income 
allowances for returns are estimated based on historical rates 
allowances for returns  advertising allowances  warehouse allowances and volume rebates are netted against sales 
these allowances are recorded commensurate with sales activity and the cost of such allowances is netted against sales in reporting the results of operations 
shipping and handling costs  net of amounts reimbursed by customers  are relatively insignificant and are included in net sales 
allowances against accounts receivable the company s allowances against accounts receivable are primarily contractually agreed upon deductions for items such as advertising and warehouse allowances and volume rebates 
these deductions are recorded throughout the year commensurate with sales activity 
funding of the majority of the company s allowances occurs on a per invoice basis 
the allowances for customer deductions  which are netted against accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets  consist of agreed upon advertising support  markdowns and warehouse and other allowances 
consistent with the guidance provided in issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf  released by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board fasb  all such allowances are recorded as direct offsets to sales and such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activities 
when a customer requests deductions  the allowances are reduced to reflect such payments 
the company analyzes the components of the allowances for customer deductions monthly and adjusts the allowances to the appropriate levels 
the timing of the customer initiated funding requests for advertising support can cause the net balance in the allowance account to fluctuate from period to period 
the timing of such funding requests should have no impact on the consolidated statements of income since such costs are accrued commensurate with sales activity 

table of contents the company factors the majority of its receivables 
in the event a factored receivable becomes uncollectible due to credit worthiness  the factor bears the risk of loss 
the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectiblity of its non factored accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customers payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable at march  totaled million  net of allowances of million 
royalty payments the company has entered into agreements that provide for royalty payments based on a percentage of sales with certain minimum guaranteed amounts 
these royalty amounts are accrued based upon historical sales rates adjusted for current sales trends by customers 
total royalty expenses  net of royalty income  included in cost of sales amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
inventory valuation the preparation of the company s financial statements requires careful determination of the appropriate dollar amount of the company s inventory balances 
such amount is presented as a current asset in the company s consolidated balance sheets and is a direct determinant of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income and  therefore  has a significant impact on the amount of net income reported in an accounting period 
the basis of accounting for inventories is cost  which is the sum of expenditures and charges  both direct and indirect  incurred to bring inventory to its existing condition and location 
the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method  which assumes that inventory quantities are sold in the order in which they are manufactured or purchased 
the determination of the indirect charges and their allocation to the company s finished goods inventories is complex and requires significant management judgment and estimates 
differences would result in the valuation of the company s inventories and in the amount and timing of the company s cost of goods sold and resulting net income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
on a periodic basis  management reviews its inventory quantities on hand for obsolescence  physical deterioration  changes in price levels and the existence of quantities on hand which may not reasonably be expected to be used or sold within the normal operating cycles of the company s operations 
to the extent that any of these conditions is believed to exist or the market value of the inventory expected to be realized in the ordinary course of business is no longer as great as its carrying value  an allowance against the inventory valuation is established 
to the extent that this allowance is established or increased during an accounting period  an expense is recorded in cost of goods sold in the company s consolidated statements of income 
when inventory for which an allowance has been established is later sold or is otherwise disposed  the allowance is reduced accordingly 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount and adequacy of this allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from management s estimates or these estimates and judgments are revised in future periods  the company may need to establish additional allowances which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
as of march   the company s inventories totaled million  net of allowances for discontinued  irregular  slow moving and obsolete inventories of million 
management believes that the company s inventory allowances are sufficient to result in a net valuation of the carrying amount of the inventory at lower of cost or market 
provisions for income taxes the provisions for income taxes include all currently payable federal  state and local taxes that are based upon the company s taxable income and the change during the fiscal year in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
the company provides for deferred income taxes based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the company s provision for income taxes on continuing operations is based upon an effective tax rate  excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge  of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
these effective tax rates are the sum of the top us statutory federal income tax rate and a composite rate for state income taxes net of federal tax benefit in the various states in which the company operates 
beginning with the company s adoption on april  of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas 
table of contents no 
fin  the company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
based on its recent evaluation  the company has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the company s consolidated financial statements 
tax years still open to federal or state general examination or other adjustment as of march  include tax years ended april   april   march  and march   as well as the tax year ended april  for several states 
the company s policy is to accrue interest expense and penalties as appropriate on any estimated unrecognized tax benefits as a charge to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
prior to the adoption of fin  the company recognized the effect of income tax positions only if it was probable that such positions would be sustained 
valuation of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill the company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
in the event of impairment  the asset is written down to its fair market value 
assets to be disposed of  if any  are recorded at the lower of net book value or fair market value  less cost to sell at the date management commits to a plan of disposal  and are classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company reported goodwill of million at march  the company tests the fair value of the goodwill of its reporting units annually in a two step approach 
the first step is the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit to ensure that its fair value exceeds its carrying value 
if step one indicates that a potential impairment exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of an impairment charge  if any 
in the second step  these estimated fair values are used as the hypothetical purchase price for the reporting units  and an allocation of such hypothetical purchase price is made to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assigned liabilities of the reporting units 
the impairment charge is calculated as the amount  if any  that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation 
an impairment test must be performed more frequently if an event or change in circumstances occurs that suggest that the fair value of the goodwill of either of the reporting units of the company has more likely than not fallen below its carrying value 
the market capitalization of the company was below its net book value for most of the second half of fiscal year  which the company concluded was a triggering event that required the company to perform an interim impairment test of the goodwill of its reporting units 
as a result of step one of this interim impairment test  the company concluded that the fair values of its two reporting units were below their carrying values  indicating that the goodwill within these reporting units had been impaired 
in step two of the interim impairment test  the goodwill of the reporting units was determined to have no implied value 
accordingly  during fiscal year  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million  which represented the aggregate carrying value of the goodwill of the company s reporting units 
this impairment charge did not result in any cash expenditures  did not have an adverse effect on the covenant calculations under the company s financing agreement or the company s overall compliance with those covenants and did not affect the company s cash position  cash flows from operating activities or availability under its revolving line of credit
