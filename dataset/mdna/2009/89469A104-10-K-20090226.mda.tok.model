item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we believe we are the largest manufacturer of non dairy powdered creamer and pickles in the united states  and the largest manufacturer of private label salad dressings in the united states and canada  based upon total sales volumes 
we believe we are also the leading retail private label supplier of non dairy powdered creamer  soup and pickles in the united states  and jams in canada 
in  based on information provided by ac nielsen  private label products sold in the retail grocery channel in the united states  which compete with branded products on the basis of equivalent quality at a lower price  represented approximately of all pickle products  approximately of all non dairy powdered creamer and approximately of all canned soup 
we sell our products primarily to the retail grocery and foodservice channels 
for the year ended december   sales to the retail grocery and foodservice channels represented and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
the remaining represented industrial and export sales 
a majority of our sales are private label products 
the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations for the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position  as of the end of those periods 
this should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of december  and did not have goodwill impairment 
the company did have impairment of our san antonio farms trade name totaling approximately million  which is related to the north american retail grocery segment 
no other impairment was noted 
for a more detailed description of the results of our analysis and the related assumptions  see our critical accounting policies 
general economic conditions deteriorated throughout and resulted in rising commodity prices  the tightening of credit markets  job losses  fluctuating interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
these factors have impacted the company and its comparisons to the results achieved in and will impact the company s expectations for the acquisition landscape in was negatively impacted by high seller price expectations  tightening credit at high borrowing costs and a more limited field of potential acquirers 
we expect to be active in expanding our business through acquisitions as soon as conditions improve 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rates is primarily limited to the canadian dollar 
during  the exchange rate between the united states and canada was relatively consistent  until later in the year  when the us dollar strengthened 
the strengthening of the us dollar has resulted in significant other comprehensive losses due to the change in foreign exchange rates 
also impacted are the line items in the company s consolidated statements of income 
if the us dollar had not strengthened as it did during  the company s net sales and profits from its canadian subsidiary would have been greater

known trends and uncertainties prices of raw materials we were adversely affected by rising input costs during and  and we expect our financial results to be affected by fluctuating input costs throughout many of the raw materials used in our products rose to unusually high levels during  including processed vegetables and meats  soybean oil  casein  cheese and packaging materials 
fluctuating fuel costs are also impacting our results 
while prices for many of our raw materials decreased from their historic highs reached earlier this year  the company expects moderate price volatility for the next year with an upward trend 
we manage the impact  wherever possible  by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our production requirements 
in addition  we offset the effect by raising prices to our customers 
however  for competitive reasons  we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them 
in addition  in instances of declining input costs  customers may be looking for price reductions in situations where we have locked into pricing at higher costs 
competitive environment there has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years  and mass merchandisers are gaining market share 
as our customer base continues to consolidate  we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer  large customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers  or gain new customers 
as the consolidation of the retail grocery and foodservice industry continues  we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold 
both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail and foodservice levels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses  acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long term basis 
over the most recent three year period  the company has generated million in cash flow from operating activities 
we use this source of liquidity to finance acquisitions  pay down outstanding debt  and fund our annual capital expenditures 
management increased its focus on working capital management and has taken actions to reduce inventories and drive incremental cash flow 
if additional borrowing is needed to finance future acquisitions  approximately million was available on the revolving credit facility as of december  this facility expires in we believe that  given our cash flow from operating activities and our available credit capacity  we can comply with the current terms of the credit facility and meet foreseeable financial requirements 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and does not anticipate a significant risk to cash flows in the foreseeable future despite the current disruption of the credit markets  because the company operates in a 
table of contents relatively stable industry and has sizable market share across its product lines 
our long term financing needs will depend largely on potential acquisition activity 
the impact of the reduction in equity values of the stock market has resulted in a reduced funded balance of our pension plan  and will require additional cash contributions  which we expect to fund by cash flows from operations 
the company expects to make contributions of approximately million in sources of capital revolving credit facility on august   the company entered into amendment no 
to our unsecured revolving credit agreement  as amended the credit agreement  dated june   with a group of participating financial institutions 
among other things  amendment no 
reduces the available liquidity requirement with respect to permitted acquisitions and reduces the required consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the company also exercised its option under the credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility from million to million 
the credit agreement also provides for a million letter of credit sublimit  against which million in letters of credit have been issued but undrawn 
proceeds from the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisition financing 
the credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios  including a leverage and interest coverage ratio 
we are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december  during  the company entered into a million long term interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of november  to lock into a fixed libor interest rate base 
under the terms of the agreement  million in floating rate debt was swapped for a fixed rate of interest rate base for a period of months  amortizing to million for an additional nine months at the same interest rate 
the company did not apply hedge accounting and recorded the fair value of this instrument on its balance sheet within other long term liabilities 
the fair value of the swap  using level inputs  was a liability of approximately million 
the company recorded the expense related to the mark to market adjustment of million within the other income expense line of the consolidated statements of income 
on september   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal of senior notes due september  pursuant to a note purchase agreement among treehouse and a group of purchasers 
all of the company s obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bay valley foods  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the senior notes have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption 
net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement 
we are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december  seasonality our short term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital during the year 
due to the seasonality of cucumber and fruit production driven by harvest cycles  which occur primarily during the spring and summer  inventories generally are at a low point in late spring and at a high point during the fall  increasing our working capital requirements 
in addition  we build inventories of soup in the summer months in anticipation of large seasonal shipments that begin late in the third quarter

payments required under long term capitalized lease contracts 
primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes 
we enter into these contracts from time to time in an effort to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients 
in addition  we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process 
in accordance with gaap  these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental payments under non cancelable operating leases 
benefit obligations consist of future payments related to pension and postretirement benefits as estimated by an actuarial valuation 

table of contents deferred compensation obligations have been allocated to payment periods based on existing payment plans for terminated employees and the estimated timing of distributions of current employees based on age 
the fin long term liability recorded by the company is million at december   of which is expected to be settled within one to three years 
the remaining or million has been excluded from the table 
the timing of cash settlement for this portion  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated due to offsetting positions and conclusions upon audit 
the company s gross unrealized tax benefit is approximately million 
the difference between the gross unrealized tax benefit and the fin liability is due to the inclusion of corollary positions  interest  penalties  as well as the impact of state taxes on the federal tax liability  which are included in the computation of the fin liability but not the gross unrecognized tax benefit 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement  other than operating leases  which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
other commitments and contingencies we also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities  in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation  investigations and tax audits certain lease obligations  and selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and 
other casualty losses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment 
in certain circumstances  however  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies 
accounts receivable we provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to days  perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
as these factors change  our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  or approximately of the accounts receivable balance 
we also maintain an allowance for customer promotional programs  marketing co op programs and other sales and marketing expenses 
this allowance is based on historical rolling twelve month average program activity and can fluctuate due to the level of sales and marketing programs 
this allowance was million and million  at december  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets totaled million as of december   resulting primarily from acquisitions 
upon acquisition  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including trademarks and customer related intangible assets  with 
table of contents any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks are not amortized 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  our reporting units are defined as retail grocery us  retail grocery canada  food away from home us  food away from home canada  industrial bulk and co pack 
we believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
if these perpetual trademark criteria are not met  the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives 
determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment  market share  trademark history and anticipated future trademark support 
indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently  if other events occur  to ensure that fair value continues to exceed the related book value 
an indefinite lived trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds fair value 
goodwill impairment is indicated if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
if the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value  the asset is written down to fair value  which is generally based on its discounted future cash flows 
future business results could impact the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis as of december  our assessment was completed with the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist  and did not result in goodwill impairment 
we have six reporting units  five of which contain goodwill 
our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach  with each method given equal weighting 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied  with the weighted average of all discount rates being equal to the total company discount rate 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
further supporting our assessment of goodwill is the fact that our company s stock price has increased from december  to december  by over 
however  if the fair value of one of our reporting units  which contains million of goodwill  decreases by approximately due to changes in expected cash flows or key assumptions  the reporting unit could potentially be impaired in the future 
our other reporting units fair values were well in excess of their carrying values 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
we reviewed our indefinite lived intangible assets  which include our trade names  using the relief from royalty method 
significant assumptions include the royalty  growth and discount rates 
our assumptions were based on historical performance and management estimates  as well as available data on licenses of similar products 
our analysis resulted in the impairment of our san antonio farms trade name  totaling approximately million  and is related to the north american retail grocery segment 
no other impairment was identified 
our analysis also resulted in changing the classification of the san antonio farms  steinfeld and natures goodness trade names from indefinite to definite lived assets 
our change in classification is consistent with the company s policy that indefinite lived assets must have a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
when these criteria are no longer met  the company changes the classification 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value  which is generally based on discounted future cash flows 
we reviewed our amortizable intangible definite lived assets and concluded no changes are necessary to the remaining useful lives or values 

table of contents purchase price allocation we allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
all identifiable assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles  and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company  normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the cost of the acquired company  over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired  less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
we record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation 
to the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations  such differences would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill 
the final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including quoted market prices  forecast of expected cash flows  net realizable values  estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period  which would have an impact on our earnings 
future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
stock based compensation income from continuing operations before income taxes  for the years ended december  and december   included share based compensation expense for employee and director stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units  and performance units of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock unit awards and performance units the awards is determined on the date of grant 
stock options were valued using a black scholes model and certain restricted stock and restricted stock units were valued using a monte carlo simulation 
performance units and all other restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards were valued using the closing price of the company s stock on the date of grant 
share based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas no 
r  could have been impacted  if other assumptions were used 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be impacted in future periods 
as the company s stock was not publicly traded prior to june   expected volatilities are based on the implied historical volatilities from peer companies and other factors 
the company has estimated that certain employees will complete the required service conditions associated with certain restricted stock  restricted stock units  stock options and performance unit awards 
for all other employees  the company estimates forfeitures as not all employees are expected to complete all the required service conditions 
the expected service period is the longer of the derived service period  as determined from the output of the valuation models  and the service period based on the term of the awards 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the awards is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
as the company does not have significant history to determine the expected term of its option awards  we based the expected term on that of comparable companies 
the assumptions used to calculate the option and restricted stock awards granted in are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance accruals we retain selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and other casualty losses 
many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers having high deductible limits 
in other areas  we are self insured with stop loss coverage 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables  including claims history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are based on 
table of contents industry factors and  along with the estimated liabilities  are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
at december  and  we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of million and million  respectively  including both current and long term liabilities 
changes in loss development factors  claims history and cost trends could result in substantially different results in the future 
employee benefit plan costs we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends  when it is deemed appropriate 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
in  we retained investment consultants to assist our investment committee with the transition of plan assets to a master trust and to help our investment committee formulate a long term investment policy for the newly established master trust 
our current asset mix guidelines  under the investment policy  target equities at to of the portfolio and fixed income at to 
at december   our master trust was invested as follows equity securities of  fixed income securities of  and cash and cash equivalents of 
we determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plan s investments based on target allocations of the pension plan s investments 
additionally  we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plan s investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity  debt and other investments 
the resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is while a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature  including assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and mortality rates  generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions 
as such  our discount rate will likely change more frequently 
we used a discount rate to determine our estimated future benefit obligations of  at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee pension and retirement benefit plans 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations the company entered into a million long term interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of november  to lock into a fixed libor interest rate base 
under the terms of the agreement  million in floating rate debt was swapped for a fixed interest base rate for a period of months  amortizing to million for an additional nine months at the same interest rate 
under the terms of the company s revolving credit agreement  and in conjunction with our credit spread  this will result in an all in borrowing cost on the swapped principal being no more than during the life of the swap agreement 
in july  we entered into a forward interest rate swap transaction for a notational amount of million as a hedge of the forecasted private placement of million in senior notes 
the interest rate swap transaction was terminated on august   which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
the 
table of contents unamortized loss is reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the total loss will be reclassified ratably to the consolidated statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the term of the senior notes  providing an effective interest rate of over the terms of the senior notes 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or hold any derivative financial instruments  other than our interest rate swap agreement  as of december   which could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase in the amount of interest expense we expect to pay with respect to our revolving credit facility  which is tied to variable market rates 
based on our outstanding debt balance of million under our revolving credit facility  and adjusting for the million fixed rate swap agreement  as of december   each rise in our interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
input costs the costs of raw materials  as well as packaging materials and fuel  have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
many of the raw materials that we use in our products rose to unusually high levels during  including processed vegetables and meats  soybean oil  casein  cheese and packaging materials 
in addition  fuel costs  which represent the most important factor affecting utility costs at our production facilities and our transportation costs  rose to unusually high levels in the middle of furthermore  certain input requirements  such as glass used in packaging  are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
the most important raw material used in our pickle operations is cucumbers 
we purchase cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers strategically located to supply our production facilities 
bad weather or disease in a particular growing area can damage or destroy the crop in that area  which would impair crop yields 
if we are not able to buy cucumbers from local suppliers  we would likely either purchase cucumbers from foreign sources  such as mexico or india  or ship cucumbers from other growing areas in the united states  thereby increasing our production costs 
changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials 
competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials  packaging and fuel costs 
accordingly  if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increasing raw material  packaging and fuel costs  our operating profits and margins could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  in instances of declining input costs  customers may be looking for price reductions in situations where we have locked into pricing at higher costs
