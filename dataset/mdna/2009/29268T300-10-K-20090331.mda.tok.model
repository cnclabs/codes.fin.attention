item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we engaged in the design  development  manufacturing  marketing  and installation of energy efficient lighting systems where we served two principal markets  commercial industrial lighting and pool lighting 
our business strategy evolved into providing our customers with turnkey  comprehensive energy efficient lighting solutions which included  but were not limited to  our patented and proprietary technology 
our solutions included fiber optic  light emitting diode led  ceramic metal halide cmh  high intensity discharge hid  and other highly energy efficient lighting technologies 
our strategy also incorporated continued investment in research into new and emerging energy sources including  but not limited to  solar energy 
typical savings of current technology averages in electricity costs  while providing full spectrum light closely simulating daylight colors 
during the course of we appointed a new chief executive officer  joseph g 
kaveski  under whom we aggressively realigned our organization to focus on enhanced sales and marketing efforts while implementing aggressive cost reductions in all areas of the business  and increasing our investment in sales personnel  marketing collateral  and product displays 
formally opened a state of the art sustainable lighting solutions showroom in solon  ohio  where customers  lighting specialists  designers  and installers are able to experience our technology in a variety of application settings  which further helps cement our relationships within the markets we serve 
re energized the brand name fiberstars by aligning both the pool and commercial lighting sales organizations  including customer service  under the leadership of the new vice president of sales  steve gasperson 
undertook the global marketing of the business under the energy focus brand with the common goal of providing advanced high quality lighting energy solutions that positively impact our customers bottom line  the environment  and the communities we serve 
became eligible to market products to the federal government through its general services administration gsa website www 
gsaadvantage 
gov and as of march   we have four product families  comprised of individual products  currently listed on the website 
in november  the united states department of energy named us an energy star partner on selected products 
energy star is a joint program of the united states environmental protection agency and department of energy helping americans save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices 
also in november  the defense advanced research projects agency darpa  through their small business innovation research sbir program  awarded us a contract to develop explosion proof led fixtures 
in december  the darpa sbir program awarded us an additional contract to develop berth lighting systems that will effectively reset a military service member s natural body rhythms to artificially created environments 
these systems will be tested initially by the united states navy 
the two darpa sbir contracts are for a total of  also in december  we installed high efficiency lighting fixtures to retrofit of the high bay lighting in a hangar deck on board an arleigh burke class naval destroyer 
this installation followed a yearlong demonstration on board naval vessels that replaced existing fluorescent  incandescent  and halogen lighting with various led lighting solutions 
results of operations net sales our sales breakdowns  by product lines  with efo products as a separate line item  are as follows in thousands product line breakdown year ended december  efo traditional pool traditional commercial lighting total efo sales reported in have been reclassified for comparability with efo products included in and net sales increased less than to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily a result of a  increase in net sales by our european subsidiaries  as well as an increase of  in united states traditional and efo commercial lighting and government efo lighting sales 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in traditional pool and efo pool lighting sales 
during   of revenue was recognized from the delivery of certain milestones to ei dupont de nemours and company as part of the very high efficiency solar cell vhesc consortium being funded by darpa 
our net sales decreased to  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  in efo sales were  for the twelve months ended december   or of total net sales  compared to  for and  for efo sales in   and include sales from efo fiber optic lighting  efo led  efo controls  and efo government products 
in  international sales increased significantly to exceed comparable and levels resulting from improved penetration of efo in the middle east and india construction markets 
however  deteriorating global economic conditions within the housing and construction industries did have an adverse impact on the magnitude of our continued expansion within the middle east and india markets during the second half of in  net sales decreased by to  compared to  in the decrease was a result of lower sales of pool products  excluding efo  of  or  and commercial lighting products of  or  which was partially offset by increased sales of efo products of  or  the decrease in traditional pool lighting sales was due primarily to a decrease in sales from our in ground and jazz lighting products 
the decrease in traditional commercial lighting sales was due to lower sales in the united states and germany 
international sales we have foreign manufacturing operations in the united kingdom and germany  and revenue and expenses from these operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
fluctuations in these operations respective currencies may have an impact on our business  results of operations  and financial position 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our international operations 
as a result  we may experience substantial foreign currency translation gains or losses due to the volatility of other currencies compared to the united states dollar  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these operations 
international sales accounted for approximately of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in and in the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a reduction in reported net sales for of  from levels as compared to an increase in reported net sales for of  from levels 
on a local currency basis  net sales increased for our international operations from levels 
the breakdown of our international sales is as follows in thousands year ended december united states domestic germany united kingdom others total sales gross profit we had gross profit of  in  a decrease of  compared to  in total gross profit as a percentage of total net sales was in  compared to in included in the gross profit is total expense in the amount of  related to our modification of the definition of slow moving and obsolete inventory reserve 
management deems this increase appropriate as technology within the lighting industry continues to accelerate 
gross profit was also favorably impacted by a mid year price increase within the commercial lighting business unit 
for  we intend to continue to combat global economic pressures by focusing sales resources in new and existing market channels including food retailers  cold storage  and government facilities 
further  we will continue to implement strategic sourcing and operational cost reductions on a global basis 
selected price increases will also be implemented 
in  we had gross profit of  compared to  in as a percentage of sales  the gross profit for  was compared to in lower margins from commercial lighting and pool sales contributed towards much of the decline in operating expenses research and development gross research and development expenses were  in  a decrease from  in gross research and development expenses were  in  a decrease from  in the decrease in was primarily due to a  decrease in salaries and benefits  and a  decrease in project related costs 
the decrease in from levels was primarily due to a decrease in temporary labor and consultant fees of  offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of  our research and development expenses are reduced on a proportional performance basis under darpa sbir development contracts 
these contracts were signed in  for a total of  to be reimbursed over the two year life of the contracts 
the gross and net research and development spending along with credits from government contracts is shown in the following table in thousands year ended december  gross r d expense and government reimbursement gross expenses for r d deduct incurred and accrued credits from government contracts net r d expenses total credits received and revenue recognized on government projects incurred and accrued credits from government contracts revenue recognized for completed deliveries net credits received and revenue recognized credits received from government contracts for research for which we are the beneficiary during the fiscal year are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
the amount of credits incurred and accrued from government contracts were  in  compared to  in  and  in net research and development expenses were of sales in  compared to of sales in  and in when the government contract is for the delivery of a product or service  we recognize revenue from those government projects according to proportional performance method or actual deliveries made 
costs related to the completion of the sale are charged to cost of sales 
in  revenue recognized from completed deliveries was  the revenue recognized for completed deliveries of products or services was  in and  in for further information on our revenue recognition policy  please refer to critical accounting policies and estimates within this section of the report 
net credits received from government reimbursement are the combination of revenue and credits against gross research and development costs 
in  our net credits were  compared to  in and  in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were  in  compared to  in  a decrease of 
in  sales and marketing expenses for pool lighting amounted to  or of total sales and marketing cost  whereas sales and marketing expense for commercial lighting was  or of total marketing costs 
the decrease in was primarily a result of a  decrease in salaries and benefits  a  decrease in advertising and trade show expenses  and a  decrease in expenses related to stock based compensation 
contributing to the overall decrease in salaries versus levels was the termination of the vice president of pool lighting sales  and the subsequent reorganization of the pool lighting  commercial lighting  and customer service organizations under new leadership 
this reorganization enabled us to re energize the fiberstars brand name under common leadership 
further  we have aggressively recruited experienced energy solutions focused salespeople from leading firms in the industry  and have successfully hired a new vice president of sales and seasoned account executives 
these new employees  combined with our sales consultants  possess more than years of energy solutions business development experience 
in  sales and marketing expenses were  an increase of less than compared to the  in in  sales and marketing expenses for pool lighting amounted to  or of total sales and marketing cost  whereas sales and marketing expense for commercial lighting was  or of total marketing costs

general and administrative general and administrative expenses were of sales in  compared to of sales in  and of sales in general and administrative expenses were  in  a increase  as compared to  in this increase was largely a result of a  increase in salaries and benefits primarily due to the may appointment of our new chief executive officer as well as the reclassification of certain executives out of manufacturing and research and development 
also causing the increase was a  increase in audit and legal service fees and a  increase in travel expenses 
these increases were offset by reductions in temporary labor and consulting fees  professional service fees  and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses were  in  a decrease  as compared to  in this decrease was largely a result of a  decrease in stock based compensation compared to  as well as management s efforts to reduce overall costs 
general and administrative cost reduction efforts during were offset by a one time charge of  for severance   of which was in the general and administrative expenses category 
the rest of the severance expenses were related to other line items such as sales and marketing and restructuring expenses 
in  we also incurred a non recurring general and administrative charge of  in the third quarter for bad debts which was due to a change in policy for calculating the reserve 
without these two non recurring charges  the general and administrative expenses for would have been  a decrease of from in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our annual test for impairment required under sfas  and based on an assessment of its present and future operations  we recognized a non cash expense of  for the impairment of our goodwill 
the goodwill was originally recorded at the time of the acquisitions of fiber optic international  crescent lighting limited  lbm lichleit fasertechnik  unison fiber optic lighting systems  and lightly expressed limited 
as of december   we have no remaining goodwill on our books 
there was no impairment of goodwill in or the restructuring expenses in were  compared to  in  a decrease of 
the cost is associated with relocating the fiber production operation from mexico to solon  ohio 
the restructuring costs were for the relocation of the corporate headquarters from fremont  california to solon  ohio 
excluding the non cash loss on impairment charge of  in  total operating expenses decreased  or  from levels 
other income and expenses we had interest income of  and interest expense of  in interest income consists of interest earned on deposits

the investment was made by several current energy focus shareholders 
these investors agreed to an at market purchase of approximately  units for per unit  based on the closing bid price of energy focus common shares on march  of 
each unit comprised one share of our common stock  par value per share  and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants were immediately separable from the units  immediately exercisable  and will expire march  this additional financing is being used to fund working capital requirements and perform additional research and development 
cash used in operating activities net cash used by operating activities primarily consists of net loss adjusted by non cash items  including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  loss on impairment  and the effect of changes in working capital 
cash decreased during  by a net loss of  compared to net losses of  and  for  and respectively 
after adjustments  net cash used by operating activities was  in  compared to  for and  in our efforts to manage working capital provided cash of  net of the increase in inventory reserve  during by reducing accounts receivable and inventory  as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses

as a result of the cash used in operating and financing activities  and the cash provided by investing activities  there was a net increase in cash in of  that resulted in an ending cash balance of  as of december  this compares to a net increase in cash of  in  resulting in an ending cash balance of  at the end of  and a net decrease in cash of  in  resulting in an ending cash balance of  at the end of effective october   we entered into a one year credit agreement with silicon valley bank svb incorporating a  revolving line of credit which replaced all existing facilities including the united states term loans 
this new line of credit includes a  sub limit for cash management products  letters of credit  and foreign exchange 
under this new agreement  all domestic existing term loans and revolving credit lines were repaid and funded by this new borrowing arrangement 
the amount of borrowing available to us is the lesser of  or the sum of the following up to a advance rate against eligible accounts receivable  as defined by the agreement  up to of our cash balance in deposit at svb  capped at  and up to a advance rate against eligible early buy accounts receivable  as defined by the agreement  capped at  borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by our assets  including intellectual property and bears interest at the svb prime rate plus 
if we terminate the facility prior to maturity  we will be required to pay a termination fee 
we are required to maintain of our cash and cash equivalents in operating and investment accounts with svb and its affiliates 
we are required to comply with certain covenant requirements  including a tangible net worth covenant 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant requirement 
at december   the interest rate was  and we had borrowings under the line of credit of  and available borrowings of  effective january   we entered into a first loan modification and forbearance agreement with svb which modified the one year credit agreement entered into on october  this modification to the terms of the credit agreement states that borrowings are collateralized by our assets  including intellectual property and bears interest at the svb prime rate plus 
svb also agreed to forebear from exercising its rights and remedies against us as a result of violating its tangible net worth covenant as of december  we are currently working with svb to revise our tangible net worth covenant 
for  our bank line of credit in the united states was based on an agreement with svb dated august  it was amended on july   and on september  the most recent amendment extended the credit agreement through october  the total credit facility was for  and incorporated both a revolving line of credit and term loan 
the interest rate was at december  the rate was the same for both the term loan and line of credit 
borrowings under the svb agreement were collateralized by our assets and intellectual property 
specific borrowings under the revolver were tied to accounts receivable  and we were required to comply with certain covenants with respect to effective net worth and financial ratios 
we had borrowings under the revolving line of credit of  at december   which was classified as a current liability 
we had total borrowings of  under the term loan portion of the agreement as of december   which was classified as a current liability 
we paid an unused line fee of against any unused daily balance during the year 
through our subsidiary in the united kingdom  we maintain a bank overdraft facility of  in british pounds sterling  based on the exchange rate at december  under an agreement with lloyds bank plc 
there were no borrowings against this facility as of december  or december  the facility is renewed annually on january the interest rate on the facility was at december   and at december  through our german subsidiary  we maintain a credit facility under an agreement with sparkasse neumarkt bank 
this credit facility was put in place to finance the building of offices in berching  germany  which are owned and occupied our german subsidiary 
in november   we began discussions with sparkasse neumarkt bank related to the restructuring of the current credit facility 
it was agreed that additional investment in our german subsidiary would be made in as a precondition to maintaining the current facility structure 
as of december   we had borrowings of  in euros  based on the exchange rate at december  and  as of december  in euros  based on the exchange rate at december  against this credit facility  due december  the interest rate was at december  and december  in addition  the company s german subsidiary has a revolving line of credit for  in euros  based on the exchange rate at december  with sparkasse neumarkt bank

the revolving facility is renewed annually on january interest rates on this line of credit were at december  and at december  at december   the  revolving line of credit is a current liability 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   consisting of current and future payments for borrowings by our german subsidiary  borrowings under a credit agreement in the united states  and minimum lease payments under operating leases  as well as the effect that these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands borrowings by german subsidiary borrowings under usa credit agreement non cancelable operating leases thereafter off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or going concern we have incurred losses which have been attributable to operational performance  restructuring  and other charges such as the impairment of goodwill  which has led to negative cash flows and violations of bank debt compliance 
further  we have not historically met management budgetary forecasts 
we have managed our liquidity during this time through a series of cost reduction initiatives  bank lines of credit borrowings  and capital market transactions 
however  the global credit market crisis has had a dramatic effect on our industry and customer base 
the recession in the united states and western europe and the slowdown of economic growth in the rest of the world has created a business environment where it is substantially more difficult to obtain equity funding and additional non equity financing 
furthermore  this environment has resulted in an increased risk of customer payment defaults 
our liquidity position  as well as our operating performance  was negatively affected by these economic and industry conditions and by other financial and business factors  many of which are beyond our control 
management acknowledges that sustaining our historical level of cash utilization is not conducive to remaining a viable entity in this environment  and is in the process of aggressively transforming our business into a turnkey  comprehensive energy efficient lighting solutions provider 
in addition  management continues to aggressively reduce costs  as evidenced in the  decrease in operating expenses  excluding loss on impairment in  from levels 
these cost reductions have been achieved while simultaneously realigning and expanding our sales and marketing organization 
in this regard  we have been very successful in hiring highly experienced salespeople from leading fortune firms including our new vice president of sales 
further  we have aligned our entire engineering and research and development organization around sales and marketing to expedite new product introductions into our served available markets 
this realignment is readily evidenced by the introduction of multiple new products including  mr halogen replacement bulbs  led cold storage globe lamps  led lamps and fixtures pal  led light rails  led docklights  hid high bay fixtures  fluorescent fixtures  and compact fluorescent light bulbs lastly  we expect to continue our on going leadership role in the united states government s very high efficiency solar cell vhesc consortium sponsored by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa where we expect to be able to commercialize a solar cell technology that will significantly surpass current solar efficiencies ranging from 
our proven optics technology has already shown the ability to achieve approximately efficiency in a laboratory environment and we believe that this efficiency  or greater  can be achieved on a cost effective  commercially viable scale 
although we are optimistic about obtaining the funding necessary for us to continue as a going concern through internal means  there can be no assurances that this objective will be successful 
therefore  in the event that our cash reserves and bank lines of credit are deemed by management to not be sufficient to continue to fund operations throughout  we will aggressively pursue one or more of the following external funding sources obtain loans and or grants available through federal  state  and or local governmental agencies  obtain loans and or grants from various financial institutions  obtain loans from non traditional investment capital organizations  sale and or disposition of one or more operating units  and obtain funding from the sale of our common stock or other equity instruments 
obtaining financing through the above mentioned mechanisms contain risks  including government stimulus and or grant money is not allocated to us despite our focus on the design  development  and manufacturing of energy efficient lighting systems  loans or other debt instruments may have terms and or conditions  such as interest rate  restrictive covenants  and control or revocation provisions  which are not acceptable to management or our board of directors  the current global economic crisis combined with our current financial condition may prevent us from being able to obtain any debt financing  financing may not be available for parties interested in pursuing the acquisition of one or more of our operating units  and additional equity financing may not be available to us in the current economic environment and could lead to further dilution of shareholder value for current shareholders of record 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were utilized 
critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates that we believe have the most significant impact on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  long lived assets  valuation of inventories  accounting for income taxes  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable  has been earned  and when all of the following has occurred persuasive evidence or an arrangement exists  eg  a sales order  a purchase order  or a sales agreement  shipment has occurred the standard shipping term is fob ship point or services provided on a proportional performance basis or installation have been completed  price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sale generally is recognized upon shipping because of the following all sales made by the company to its customer base are non contingent  meaning that they are not tied to that customer s resale of products  standard terms of sale contain shipping terms of fob ship point  meaning that title is transferred when shipping occurs  and there are no automatic return provisions that allow the customer to return the product in the event that the product does not sell within a defined timeframe 
revenue from installation services  including design and integration services and other services where product sales are not incorporated into the contract  is recognized upon the following proportional performance method using the ratio of labor cost incurred to the total final estimated labor cost 
under this method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of anticipated revenue that has been earned 
revenue from product sales that incorporate specifically defined installation services is recognized as follows product sale at completion of installation and installation service at completion of installation 
we warrant our products against defects or workmanship issues 
we set up allowances for estimated returns  discounts  and warranties upon recognition of revenue and these allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated returns  discounts  and warranty expenses 
these allowances are based on past history and historical trends  current economic conditions  and contractual terms 
our distributor s obligation to us is not contingent upon the resale of our products and as such does not prohibit revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns  and discounts we establish allowance for doubtful accounts and returns for probable losses  based on past history  current economic conditions  and contractual terms 
the specific components are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable  and allowance for sales returns 
in  the total allowance was  with  related to accounts receivable and  related to sales return 
in  the total allowance had a balance of  with  related to accounts receivable and  related to sales return 
the company reviews these allowance accounts periodically and adjusts them according to current conditions 
long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible net assets of the businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subjected to an annual impairment test 
fixed assets are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets two to fifteen years 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or the lease term  whichever is shorter  generally three to seven years 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets may be impaired  an evaluation is performed comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount to determine whether a write down to market value or discounted cash flow is required 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test at december  the impairment test first utilized a market capitalization methodology to calculate the fair value of our goodwill as of the test date  which was less than its respective carrying value  indicating impairment 
as a result  we performed step two of our impairment analysis 
based on the results of the impairment test  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for goodwill of  in the fourth quarter of  which represents the entire carrying balance of goodwill  net of foreign currency translation 
valuation of inventories we state inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost determined using the first in first out method or market 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
during   and  we charged   and  respectively  to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventories 
included in is total expense in the amount of  related to our modification of the definition of slow moving and obsolete inventory reserve 
management deems this increase appropriate as technology developments within the lighting industry continues to accelerate 
adjustments to our estimates  such as forecasted sales and expected product lifecycles  could harm our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then must assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not certain or is unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the united states and germany  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based upon our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
share based payments in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised or fas r  share based payments 
fas r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees 
the company has applied fas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  we are required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab  which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between fas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
it also provides the sec staff s views regarding valuation of share based payment arrangements 
the application of fas r with sab had the effect of increasing stock based compensation expense and reducing earnings by  in   in  and  in we measure all employee stock based awards as an expense based on the grant date fair value of these awards 
the fair value of options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
weighted average assumptions used in the model include the expected life of the options  volatility  and risk free interest rate 
the estimated expected life of the option is calculated based on the contractual life of the option  the vesting life of the option  and historical exercise patterns of vested options 
the volatility estimates are calculated using historical pricing experience
