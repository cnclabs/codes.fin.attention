item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations information appearing under results of operations  financial position  capital resources and liquidity  critical accounting policies and the safe harbor statement in the annual report are hereby incorporated by reference 
fiscal outlook fiscal year was a challenging year  but emerson believes it is well positioned moving into the uncertain economic environment 
underlying sales for fiscal year are expected to decline in the range of negative percent to negative percent  which excludes an estimated favorable increase of percent to percent due to foreign currency translation  completed and assumed future acquisitions and potential divestitures 
reported sales for the year are forecast to be in the range of positive percent to negative percent compared with sales of billion 
the company also expects the operating profit margin to be flat to slightly down for the full year 
there can be no assurance when or if potential future acquisitions or divestitures will be completed and what impact future exchange rate changes will have 
non gaap financial measures to supplement emerson s financial information presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management uses certain non gaap financial measures as such term is defined in regulation g under the rules of the sec  to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s operating performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
for example  non gaap measures may exclude the impact of certain unique items such as acquisitions  divestitures  one time gains and losses or items outside of management s control  such as foreign currency exchange rates 
management believes that the following non gaap financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into emerson s financial position and operating performance 
underlying sales  which exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures during the periods presented  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  are provided to facilitate relevant period to period comparisons of sales growth by excluding these unique items that impact the overall comparability 
underlying sales should be viewed in addition to  and not as an alternative to  net sales as determined in accordance with us gaap 
operating profit defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses and operating profit margin defined as operating profit divided by net sales are indicative of short term operational performance and ongoing profitability 
management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability 
operating profit and operating profit margin should be viewed in addition to  and not as an alternative to  pretax earnings or profit margin as determined in accordance with us gaap 
earnings  earnings per share  return on equity and return on total capital excluding one time gains and losses provide additional insight into the underlying  ongoing operating performance of the company and facilitate period to period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items 
given the unique nature of these items  management believes that presenting earnings  earnings per share  return on equity and return on total capital excluding them is more representative of the company s operational performance and may be more useful for investors 
however  these financial measures are not intended to replace earnings  earnings per share  return on equity or return on total capital as determined in accordance with us gaap 
free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures is an indicator of the company s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations 
operating cash flow adds back non cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures 
although management believes that free cash flow is useful to both management and investors as a measure of the company s ability to generate cash  it is not intended to replace operating cash flow as determined in accordance with us gaap 
overall  while emerson believes these non gaap financial measures are useful in evaluating the company  this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
further  the calculation of these non gaap financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore they may not be comparable among companies
