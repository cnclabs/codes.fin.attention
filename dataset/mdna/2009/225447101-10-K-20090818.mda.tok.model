item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of our consolidated financial statements  including a brief discussion of our business and products  key factors that impacted our performance  and a summary of our operating results 
this executive summary should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this item  risk factors in item a and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report 
overview of our business and products we are a manufacturer of semiconductor materials and devices primarily based on sic  gan and related compounds 
we currently focus our expertise in sic and gan on led products  which consist of led chips  led components and led lighting products 
we also develop power and rf products  including power switching and rf devices 
we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our led products 
we also generate revenue from sales of sic and gan materials and power and rf products  and we earn revenue under government contracts that support some of our research and development programs to the extent the contract funding exceeds our direct cost of performing those activities 
we generate revenues from the following product lines led products 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of our led products 
our led products consist of our led chips  led components including our xlamp led components and high brightness led components and led lighting products 
materials products 
these products include our sic and gan wafers  which are used in manufacturing leds  rf and microwave devices  power devices and for research and development 
power and rf products 
these products include power switching devices made from sic  which provide faster switching speeds than comparable silicon based power devices  and also include rf microwave devices made from sic or gan  which allow for higher power densities as compared to silicon or gallium arsenide 
contracts with government agencies 
government agencies provide us with funding to support the development of primarily sic and gan based new technology 
the majority of our products are produced at our production facilities located in north carolina and china 
in some circumstances  we also use contract manufacturers for certain aspects of product fabrication 
operating segments we currently operate our business as one reportable segment 
in fiscal  we operated our business in two reportable segments 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of the cree microwave segment  our silicon based rf and microwave semiconductor business located in sunnyvale  california 
effective december   we reported cree microwave as a discontinued operation 
for further information about this business closure  see note  discontinued operations  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
industry dynamics our business is primarily focused on selling our led products 
leds are currently used in a variety of applications  including energy efficient indoor and outdoor lighting  liquid crystal display lcd backlighting  video screens  gaming  signals  automotive applications and mobile phones 
as led technology continues to develop and improve  we believe the potential market for led lighting applications will continue to expand 

table of contents select industry factors affecting our business include  among others overall demand for products and applications using leds 
although we have seen increased adoption of leds in lighting products over the last fiscal year  the global recession has reduced demand for leds in consumer  mobile and automotive applications 
the pace of adoption of led lighting technology in the general illumination market and others will impact the demand for leds 
intense and constantly evolving competitive environment 
competition in the industry is intense 
product pricing pressures exist as market participants often undertake pricing strategies to gain or protect market share 
to remain competitive  market participants generally must increase product performance and reduce costs to offset lower average sales prices 
technological innovation and advancement 
innovations and advancements in led technology continue to expand the potential commercial application of leds particularly in the general illumination market 
however  new technologies could emerge or improvements could be made in existing technologies that may reduce the demand for leds in certain markets 
rising energy costs 
led lighting technology can be more energy efficient than most traditional lighting technologies and can yield substantial reductions in energy usage for consumers 
concerns about rising energy costs have driven increased demand for more energy efficient lighting solutions 
regulatory actions concerning energy efficiency 
government regulations and programs designed to encourage or mandate increased energy efficiency  even in some cases banning forms of incandescent lighting  are advancing the adoption of more energy efficient lighting solutions such as leds 
intellectual property issues 
market participants rely on patented and non patented proprietary information relating to product development  manufacturing capabilities and other core competencies of their business 
protection of intellectual property is critical 
as such  steps such as additional patent applications  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements  as well as other security measures are generally taken 
to enforce or protect intellectual property rights  litigation or threatened litigation commonly occurs 
fiscal highlights the following is a summary of key financial results and certain non financial results achieved for the year ended june  our revenues from continuing operations for the year increased to million 
we experienced strong sales growth in our led products  which increased million or from the prior year 
revenues from the sale of our led components increased substantially from the prior year more than offsetting a decline in revenues attributable to sales of our led chips 
revenues from the sales of our led components represented over half of our total revenues from led products in fiscal our gross margin percentage increased from the prior year to approximately of revenue  reflecting our progress in improving new product introductions which more than offset increased competition in led chips and led components 
we achieved operating income of approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal we generated positive cash flow from operations of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal combined cash  cash equivalents and investments increased million or to million at june  compared to million at june  we substantially completed the integration of cotco and llf into our business 
we continued the transition of our production process from a three inch to four inch wafer 
this transition has improved our chip yield per wafer and consequently lowered our cost per chip 

table of contents business outlook we project that the markets for our products will remain highly competitive during fiscal we anticipate focusing on the following key areas  among others  in response to this competitive environment build on our leadership in led lighting and further disrupt existing lighting markets 
over the next year we look to motivate traditional lighting companies to embrace led technology for their products and expand the market for our led components by developing new lighting applications for led technology 
as we continue to develop our product offering  we also plan to further develop our sales and distribution channels to make led lighting products more accessible to a broader base of customers 
enable our lighting customers to help grow led component sales 
although sales of led component products were our primary growth driver in fiscal  led lighting still represents a very small fraction of the overall lighting market 
we plan to accelerate led penetration through the creation of more efficient led components  the development of more integrated products that are easier for traditional lighting companies to use  as well as increasing investment in our technical support capabilities by opening several new led lighting application centers around the world 
maintain the product margin levels we achieved and build operating leverage in the business 
there are some supply constraints in the led products market which should help our margins in the short term  however  the overall led market remains highly competitive 
in order to maintain long term profitability we remain focused on both cost reductions and increasing the value of our products by providing new capabilities to the customer 
build on the recent progress in our power and rf product line 
we plan to expand our customer penetration into new  higher value applications for both power and rf with products such as our new z rec line of diodes  which we anticipate will improve overall demand 
evaluate strategic opportunities 
we intend to continue to evaluate and potentially pursue appropriate strategic opportunities such as technology licensing arrangements  acquisitions  partnerships or joint ventures that complement or expand our existing business

revenues from our power and rf products were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue from our power and rf products increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in our power and rf business was primarily due to an increase in orders for sic schottky diodes and gan mmics 
revenue from our power and rf products increased million  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in unit shipments of products 
the increase in unit shipments was offset by a decrease in the blended average sales price due to changes in product mix 
contracts 
revenues from our contracts comprised approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues from contracts were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the fluctuations in contract revenue from year to year are generally due to changes in the timing of the initiation of new research contracts  the value of those contracts and timing of the work performed 
upfront licensing fees 
from time to time  we may enter into licensing arrangements related to our intellectual property 
in certain instances  these arrangements may include upfront payments to us that  depending on the specific terms and underlying nature of the arrangement  may allow for immediate revenue recognition 
for fiscal  we recognized million  or  of our total revenues related to upfront payments due for licensing arrangements 
we had no such upfront licensing fee revenues in fiscal or gross profit cost of revenue includes materials  labor and overhead costs incurred internally or paid to contract manufacturers to produce our products 
gross profit in dollars and gross margin percentages were as follows in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to products  net product gross margin contracts  net contract gross margin upfront licensing fees licensing fee gross margin total gross profit total gross margin 
table of contents total gross margin from continuing operations was  and for fiscal  and  respectively and gross profit totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit from continuing operations increased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and our gross margin percentage increased to from over the same period 
factors contributing to the increase in gross margin percentage were changes in product mix to higher margin products  operating efficiencies and higher led product yields 
certain licensing arrangements also contributed approximately million of gross profit 
gross profit from continuing operations in fiscal increased million or from fiscal  however  our gross margin percentage remained consistent at of revenues 
lower gross margins on sales of led chips in fiscal were offset by higher margins on sales of our led components 
overall declines in blended average selling prices were offset by lower costs per unit 
contract gross profit was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin percentage related to contracts will fluctuate year to year based upon the mix of active contracts between cost share versus for profit research arrangements  and mix of work actually performed on those contracts in any given year 
gross margin percentage related to contract revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products and general technology research 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  consulting costs and the cost of development equipment and supplies 
the following sets forth our research and development expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenues in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to research and development percent of total revenues research and development expenses from continuing operations increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to our continued research and development activities focusing on higher brightness led chips  improved led components  a full year of research and development with respect to led lighting products after the acquisition of llf in the third quarter of fiscal and costs related to the transition to larger wafers 
in fiscal  research and development expenses from continuing operations remained consistent at million as compared to fiscal 
table of contents sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses are composed primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and our executive and administrative personnel for example  legal  finance  information technology and human resources personnel and consist of salaries and related compensation costs  consulting and other professional services such as litigation and other outside legal counsel fees  audit and other compliance costs  facilities and insurance costs  and travel and other costs 
the following table sets forth our sales  general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of revenues in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to sales  general and administrative percent of total revenues sales  general and administrative expenses  from continuing operations increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in costs in fiscal is primarily due to increased spending on sales and marketing as we expanded our sales channels and the acquisition of llf during the third quarter of fiscal additionally  costs increased due to the general expansion of our business and increased employee compensation costs 
in fiscal  sales  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase in costs in fiscal is primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of the acquired operations of cotco in fiscal as opposed to only one quarter in fiscal and increased spending on sales and marketing 
additionally  costs increased due to the general expansion of our business  increased employee compensation costs  including costs related to salaries and stock based compensation  and higher costs related to certain patent litigation 
amortization of acquisition related intangibles as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded various intangible assets including customer relationships and developed technologies 
amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions is as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to intrinsic cotco llf total amortization of acquisition related intangibles from continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of cotco in fiscal as certain assets were fully amortized during fiscal this decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of llf in fiscal as we included a full year of amortization in fiscal as opposed to less than two quarters in fiscal during fiscal  we acquired intrinsic and cotco  resulting in million of amortizable intangible assets principally composed of customer relationships and developed technology 
in fiscal  we acquired llf  resulting in an additional million of amortizable intangible assets 
these intangible assets were principally composed of developed technology that specifically relates to technologies underlying the development of led lighting products for the general illumination market 

table of contents loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets we operate a capital intensive business 
as such  we dispose of a certain level of our equipment in the normal course of business as our production processes change whether due to production improvement initiatives or product mix changes 
due to the risk of technological obsolescence or changes in our production process  we regularly review our equipment for possible impairments in value 
the following table sets forth our loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets we recorded a loss of million on the disposal of long lived assets in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal loss was composed of losses due to the impairment of certain equipment and facilities due to manufacturing process and facility changes  the impairment of capitalized patent costs and losses on the disposal of equipment due to discontinued product initiatives 
the loss in fiscal was consistent with the loss from fiscal non operating income the following table sets forth our non operating income in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to gain on sale of investments  net other non operating income interest income  net for fiscal  we did not have any significant gains or losses realized from the sale of our investments 
for fiscal and  our recorded gains on the sale of investments were principally related to the sale of our remaining holdings of color kinetics  incorporated color kinetics common stock 
during fiscal and  we sold  shares and  shares of color kinetics common stock  respectively 
as of june  we had fully liquidated our holdings in color kinetics stock 
net interest income decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a significant decline in interest rates 
net interest income remained consistent from fiscal to fiscal we have historically invested portions of our available cash in fixed interest rate securities such as high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities and other fixed interest rate investments 
the primary objective of our investments is to preserve principal 
other non operating income is comprised primarily of miscellaneous foreign exchange gains and losses 
income tax expense the following table sets forth our income tax expense in dollars and our effective tax rate from continuing operations in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to income tax expense effective tax rate on continuing operations 
table of contents we recorded income tax expense of million from continuing operations in fiscal as compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the variation between our effective tax rate and the us statutory rate of is primarily due to the consolidation of our foreign operations  which are generally subject to income taxes at lower statutory rates 
a change in the mix of pretax income from these various tax jurisdictions can have a significant impact on our periodic effective tax rate 
in addition  our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits credits in our additional paid in capital apic pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock based compensation awards such as non qualified stock options and restricted stock are less than those originally anticipated 
in addition  current proposals have been made by various us governmental bodies to change the us tax laws that include  among other things  limiting us tax deductions for expenses related to un repatriated foreign source income and modifying the us foreign tax credit rules 
although the scope of the proposed changes is unclear  it is possible that these or other changes in us tax laws could increase our us income tax liability and adversely affect our profitability 
at this time  we cannot determine the timing that the proposed changes  if enacted  are to become effective 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in fiscal  we discontinued the operations of our cree microwave subsidiary 
the following table sets forth our income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax during fiscal  we recorded after tax losses of million from our discontinued operations compared to after tax income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal for fiscal  our losses were primarily attributable to continued expenses arising from our sunnyvale facility operating lease that was associated with the operations of our discontinued cree microwave subsidiary 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company negotiated the termination of its operating lease associated with the sunnyvale facility 
as part of this termination  the company paid to the lessor a lump sum cash payment and incurred other one time costs to terminate the lease 
this resulted in a one time net after tax loss of approximately million  which is included in the loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
in fiscal  the income was due primarily to our sale of certain patents associated with our cree microwave business that resulted in a net gain of million  which was then offset by continued expenses arising from the sunnyvale facility operating lease 
in fiscal  the primary driver of the after tax income was the release of contingent tax reserves relating to our former cree microwave business as a result of the completion of internal revenue service audits of fiscal  and in the amount of million  which was partially offset by continued expenses arising from the sunnyvale facility operating lease 
liquidity and capital resources overview we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  and to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  marketable investments and cash generated from operations 
our 
table of contents ability to generate cash from operations has been one of our fundamental strengths and has provided us with substantial flexibility in meeting our operating  financing and investing needs 
we have no debt or lines of credit and have minimal lease commitments 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments  and cash generated from operations  and our ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  contractual obligations  commitments  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next months 
from time to time  we evaluate strategic opportunities and potential investments in complementary businesses and we anticipate continuing to make such evaluations 
we may also access capital markets through the issuance of new debt or additional shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets or for other strategic opportunities 
contractual obligations at june   payments to be made pursuant to significant contractual obligations are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations cotco contingent liability other long term liabilities operating leases include rental amounts due on leases of certain office and manufacturing space under the terms of non cancelable operating leases 
these leases expire at various times through december all of the lease agreements provide for rental adjustments for increases in base rent up to specific limits  property taxes and general property maintenance that would be recorded as rent expense  if applicable 
purchase obligations generally relate to the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of business such as raw materials  supplies and capital equipment 
our purchase obligations represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
as the operations acquired through the cotco acquisition achieved certain defined ebitda targets for the year ended june   we are contractually obligated to make a payment in the amount of million to the former shareholder of cotco in fiscal  which we elected to pay in cash 
as part of the llf acquisition  if llf meets the remaining defined product development targets and key employee retention measures during calendar years and  additional consideration of up to million may be payable to the former shareholders of llf during fiscal years and financial condition the following table sets forth our cash  cash equivalents and investments dollars in thousands june  june  change cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total cash and investments 
table of contents our liquidity and capital resources depend on our cash flows from operations and our working capital 
our working capital increased to million as of june  from million at june   primarily due to positive cash flows from operations and cash generated through the exercise of employee stock options 
the following table presents the components of our cash conversion cycle june  june  change days of sales outstanding a days of supply in inventory b days in accounts payable c cash conversion cycle a days of sales outstanding dso calculates the average collection period of our receivables 
dso is based on the ending net trade receivables and the revenue for the quarter then ended 
dso is calculated by adding ending accounts receivable  net of applicable allowances and reserves  and dividing that sum by the average net revenue per day for the respective quarter 
b days of supply in inventory dsi measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product 
dsi is based on ending inventory and cost of goods sold for the quarter then ended 
dsi is calculated by dividing inventory by average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter 
c days in accounts payable dpo calculates the average number of days our payables remain outstanding before payment 
dpo is based on ending accounts payable and cost of goods sold for the quarter then ended 
dpo is calculated by dividing accounts payable by the average cost of goods sold per day for the respective quarter 
overall we significantly improved our cash conversion cycle 
our dso decreased approximately days  or 
this decrease was primarily due to our successful efforts to control the growth of our outstanding receivable balances in relation to current sales levels 
our dsi decreased approximately day  or 
this decrease was primarily due to our efforts to manage our global supply chain and better control inventory levels in relation to current demand 
dpo increased by days or 
during fiscal  as a result of a strategic change in the use of invested funds  changes in market factors surrounding certain underlying securities and consideration of the current conditions in the capital markets  we determined that we would make our complete portfolio of marketable securities available for current operations 
as of june   substantially all of our investments had investment grade ratings  and any such investments that were in an unrealized loss position at june  were in such position due to interest rate changes  sector credit rating changes or company specific rating changes 
as we intend and believe that we have the ability to hold such investments for a period of time that will be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value  we currently expect to receive the full principal or recover our cost basis in these securities 
when evaluating our investments for possible impairment  we review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below our cost basis  the financial condition of the entity in which the investment is made  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
the declines in value of the securities in our portfolio are considered to be temporary in nature and  accordingly  we do not believe these securities are impaired as of june  we believe our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we have and may continue to use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents  or funds underlying our marketable securities  to repurchase shares of our common stock 
with our strong working capital position  we believe that we have the ability to continue to invest in further development of our products and  when appropriate  make selective acquisitions or other strategic investments to strengthen our product portfolio  secure key intellectual properties  or expand our production capacity 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in fiscal 
table of contents cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended year over year change june  june  june  to to cash provided by operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities effects of foreign exchange changes net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents the following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from our customers  increased year over year operating income  and improvements in the management of our inventory 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of lower net income adjusted for a million gain on sales of investments and changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily an increase in inventories 
during fiscal   and  our cash flows from operations were primarily derived from earnings from operations prior to non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  gains realized on the sale of investments and deferred income tax income or expense  and changes in our working capital  which is primarily composed of accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by changes in current expenses such as accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
our investing activities primarily relate to transactions within our investments  strategic acquisitions  purchase of property  plant and equipment and purchase of patent and or license rights 
cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to lower proceeds from maturities of investments partially offset by lower purchases of investments and the payment of the cotco and llf contingent consideration 
cash provided by investing activities increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of increased cash generated from the maturity of our fixed income investments offset by reinvestment amounts  lower capital expenditures and less cash spent on strategic acquisitions 
as part of the acquisition of cotco  we made a cash payment of million to the former shareholder of cotco in fiscal as the operations acquired through the cotco acquisition achieved certain defined ebitda targets for the year ended june   we are contractually obligated to make a payment in the amount of approximately million to the former shareholder of cotco in fiscal  which we elected to pay in cash 
this additional payment is reflected as a current obligation and increase to goodwill in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as part of the acquisition of llf  we made a cash payment in the amount of million to the former shareholders of llf in fiscal if llf meets the remaining defined product development targets and key employee retention measures during calendar years and  additional consideration of up to million may be payable to the former shareholders of llf during fiscal years and these product development targets may or may not be met  but  if such contingent payments occur  these will be considered as additional purchase price and result in an increase in goodwill 
we will continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures  while making strategic investments to develop our existing products  pursue strategic initiatives where appropriate and invest in our manufacturing and information technology infrastructure to meet the needs of our business 
we target investing between and million in fiscal for capital expenditures 
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our cash flows from financing activities are principally composed of cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases offset by cash outflows related to our repurchase of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of lower spending on the repurchase of common stock partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee stock option exercises 
cash used in financing increased on a year over year basis from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to higher spending on the repurchase of common stock than cash proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to employee stock option exercises 
as of june   there remained approximately million shares of our common stock approved for repurchase under the repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
since the inception of our stock repurchase program  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock 
at the discretion of our management  the repurchase program can be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions 
we will determine the time and extent of repurchases based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
fair value beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments was based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to measure fair value 
observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party  whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability 
a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the company is able to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar  or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 

table of contents the financial assets for which the company performs recurring fair value remeasurements are cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
the financial assets for which the company may be required to perform non recurring fair value remeasurements eg  an impairment of assets are any investments in privately held companies 
as of june   financial assets utilizing level inputs included cash equivalents such as money market deposits and other investments with quoted prices available for identical items in active markets 
financial assets utilizing level inputs included corporate bonds  municipal bonds and other instruments 
the company does not have any significant financial assets requiring the use of level inputs 
please refer to note  fair value of financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for further information 
financial and market risks we are exposed to financial and market risks  including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and investment risk 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks  however  we may choose to do so in the future 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at june  and june  actual results may differ materially 
interest rates we maintain an investment portfolio principally composed of high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities  and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security 
in order to minimize risk  we amended our cash management policy in fiscal to permit us to only acquire investments rated aaa grade or better going forward 
prior to that amendment  we were permitted to acquire investments rated a grade or better 
at june   we had million invested in these securities  compared to million at june  although these securities generally earn interest at fixed rates  the historical fair values of such investments have not differed materially from the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market price was approximately million at june  and million at june  currency exchange rates as we operate internationally and have transactions denominated in foreign currencies  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our expenses and results of operations as well as the value of our assets and liabilities 
our primary exposures relate to the exchange rates between the us dollar  the chinese renminbi  the hong kong dollar  and the japanese yen 
investment risk we have made and may make future investments in public or privately held companies having operations or technologies in areas within our strategic focus 
these investments may be marketable in the case of investments in the common stock of other publicly traded companies or potentially non marketable in certain instances with investments in privately held companies 
whether marketable or non marketable  investments can be inherently risky as markets for the technologies or products of these companies may be in the early stages of development and may never materialize 
as of june   we held a long term investment in the equity securities of color kinetics  which was treated for accounting purposes as an investment in available for sale securities 
as such  this investment was carried at fair market value based upon the quoted market price of the stock  with any net unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
during fiscal  we fully liquidated our investments in the common stock of color kinetics and received proceeds of million and recognized a pre tax gain of million from the sale for fiscal 
table of contents as of june   we have no significant investments in individual public or privately held companies 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases primarily for certain of our us and international facilities in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are often referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of june  are detailed above in liquidity and capital resources in the section entitled contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
in the application of us gaap we are required to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates 
in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates from period to period are reasonably likely to occur 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets  tax related contingencies  valuation of inventories  contingencies and litigation  and accruals for other liabilities  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with us gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require a high degree of management judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting policies and estimates  each of which is critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our products are sold through distributors 
distributors stock inventory and sell our products to their own customer base  which may include value added resellers  manufacturers who incorporate our products into their own manufactured goods  or ultimate end users of our products 
in general  we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to our distributors 
this arrangement is often referred to as a sell in or point of purchase model as opposed to a sell through or point of sale model  where revenue is deferred 
table of contents and not recognized until the distributor sells the product through to their customer 
our distributors may be provided rights that allow them to return or exchange a portion of inventory product exchange rights or stock rotation rights and receive credits for changes in selling prices price protection rights 
we also provide our customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and product warranty claims 
in addition  some of our sales arrangements provide for limited reimbursement of certain sales costs 
as a result  we record an allowance at the time of sale  which is recorded as a reduction of product revenue in the consolidated statements of income and as a reduction to accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate an allowance for anticipated sales returns based upon an analysis considering relevant facts and circumstances 
specifically  we review historical sales returns and other relevant data and match returns or other credits to the quarter when the sales were originally recorded 
based on historical return percentages and other relevant factors  we estimate our potential future exposure on product sales that have been recorded 
the allowance for sales returns  including an allowance for price protection rights  at june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
we also record an asset for the estimated value of product returns that we believe will be returned to inventory in the future and resold 
as of june  and june   we estimated the cost of future product returns at million and million  respectively 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for awards of stock based compensation under our employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method 
accordingly  we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock based awards and amortize this fair value to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards we currently use the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our then current stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
due to the inherent limitations of option valuation models available today  including future events that are unpredictable and the estimation process utilized in determining the valuation of the stock based awards  the ultimate value realized by award holders may vary significantly from the amounts expensed in our financial statements 
for restricted stock awards  grant date fair value is based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
this fair value is then amortized to compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
we estimate expected forfeitures at the time of grant and revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
our determination of an estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based upon a review of historical experience but may also include consideration of other facts and circumstances we believe are indicative of future activity 
the assessment of an estimated forfeiture rate will not alter the total compensation expense to be recognized  only the timing of this recognition as compensation expense is adjusted to reflect instruments that actually vest 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating key assumptions  we may be required to adjust compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
recoverability of long lived assets our assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets involves significant judgment and estimation 
these assessments reflect our assumptions  which  we believe  are consistent with the assumptions hypothetical 
table of contents marketplace participants use 
factors that we must estimate when performing recoverability and impairment tests include  among others  the economic life of the asset  sales volumes  prices  cost of capital  tax rates  and capital spending 
these factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events that may indicate potential impairment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment analysis is performed 
the second step is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
however  it should be noted that the loss recognized shall not be in excess of the carrying amount 
once a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying value shall be its new accounting basis 
we evaluate all other long lived assets such as property  equipment and definite lived intangible assets such as patents for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets recorded in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated we first determine if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amounts of the asset or assets 
if so  an impairment loss is measured and recorded if the discounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of the asset or assets 
we do not restore a previously recognized impairment loss if the asset s carrying value decreases below its estimated fair value 
our impairment loss calculations require that we apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  including estimating useful lives of the assets 
to make these judgments  we may use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be required to record additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
we recorded million  million and million of long lived asset impairment charges during the fiscal years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances we have established a valuation allowance for capital loss carryforwards where we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the items will not be realized due to insufficient availability of capital gains in the carryforward period 
in addition  we have established a valuation allowance related to state income tax credits recorded on the financial statements during the year for which we believe we will have insufficient state taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize the credits 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including historical and projected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
when we establish or increase a valuation allowance  our income tax expense increases in the period such determination is made 
if we decrease a valuation allowance  our income tax expense decreases in the period such determination is made 
tax contingencies we are subject to periodic audits of our income tax returns by federal  state and local agencies 
the audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in accordance with us gaap  to account for uncertainties 
table of contents in income taxes we evaluate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
us gaap requires that a tax benefit should not be recognized for financial statement purposes for an uncertain tax filing position where it is not more likely than not likelihood of greater than for being sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to the deferred tax asset or as an increase to a liability account for uncertain tax positions included in other liabilities to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain based upon one of the following the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but for a lesser amount  the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain  we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and each tax position is evaluated without considerations of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and fully resolved 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which we have recorded an unrecognized benefit or are required to pay amounts in excess of what we have recorded our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement might require use of our cash and or result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand 
in particular  we fully reserve for all inventory greater than months old  unless there is an identified need for the inventory 
we also analyze sales levels by product type  including historical and estimated future customer demand for those products to determine if any additional reserves are appropriate 
for example  we reserve for items that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand  manufacturing process changes or new product introductions that may eliminate demand for the product 
if our estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate  or market conditions or technology change in ways that are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
contingent liabilities we provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with us gaap 
in accordance with us gaap  a loss contingency is charged to income when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter to assess the potential financial exposure 
if a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and whether such loss is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to 
table of contents these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
further  estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in determining the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable  we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability  opinions of legal counsel and recent legal rulings by the appropriate regulatory bodies  among other factors 
as additional information becomes available  we reassesses the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see also a discussion of specific contingencies in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
accruals for other liabilities we make estimates for the amount of costs that have been incurred but not yet billed for our self funded medical insurance and general services  including legal fees  accounting fees and other expenses 
our liabilities contain uncertainties because we must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating our liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including interviewing our service providers for bills that have not yet been received 
for self insured liabilities  we estimate our liabilities based on historical claims experience 
if actual costs billed to us are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  our expenses could be understated or overstated and these adjustments could materially affect our net income
