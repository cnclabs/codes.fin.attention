the company s cusip number is u business review the global economic turmoil during impacted the cell phone industry 
the industry achieved healthy growth during the first half of  but experienced a downturn during the year s second half 
market indicators show that cell phone sales in the prc dropped during weeks that include prc holidays  like national day in october and labor day in may 
total cellular phone sales in the prc grew by only during the fiscal year ended december   a significant decrease from the growth rate during fiscal year as for the company  our sales volume reached a record high of million cell phone units for the fiscal year ended december  despite the market s decline in the fourth quarter of  we achieved annual sales revenues of  representing an increase of compared with the  in revenues earned during fiscal year the company believes this increase is mainly attributable to the products strategy we set at the beginning of the year to supply feature rich  economically priced  mid level and low end products a different strategy than that of foreign brands  which tend to have higher costs and higher output prices 
our sales volume has doubled compared with our sales volume  however  because of the products we sold in were priced below rmb  approximately  our gross margin has decreased dramatically compared with our gross margin for and our net income increased at a lower pace than it did the previous year 
the company believes there are three main influences on the current state of the cellular phone market in the prc 
first  the reorganization of domestic telecommunication operators has created a lag in market demand 
in particular  the market demand for high margin products during was much lower than expected 
second  the major force driving current cell phone sales in the prc is rural customers  a majority of whom tend to favor less expensive  lower end products 
third  the international financial crisis has created an overall decline in consumer demand for cell phone related products in the fourth quarter  a quarter which has historically provided the company with a proportionally larger volume of sales than other parts of the year 
the company had planned to acquire a production facility by the end of  however  negotiations for such an acquisition have been temporarily suspended in light of the current state of the economy 
at this time  the company will continue to keep the acquisition project on hold  at least until capital market financing conditions improve 
the company is aware of the possibility that the market for cellular phones in the prc will experience further downturn in the early part of  but it still projects that the industry will be in a better position in because a the reorganization of prc telecom carriers is projected to lead to market development  and b new g technology is also likely to encourage market demand 
with these projections in mind  the company plans to employ the following three operating strategies going forward safeguard our traditional sales channels and explore the possibility of selling gsm cell phones in traditional markets 
the company will use its ability to create telephone models that respond precisely to market opportunities to target customer needs 
launch our own g products while telecom carriers are promoting the commercial use of g 
according to some news bulletins  china telecom is planning to create million g subscribers through its cdma platform in  china mobile is also targeting at million g subscribers through its tds cdma platform over the coming three years  and china unicom is expecting to have million g subscribers through its wcdma platform by based on the relationships we have already built with the telecom carriers  we believe the company will be able to achieve our market share in this new era of telecom industry 
expand our industrial structure by consummating certain acquisitions using capital market funds in order to enhance our business foundation and long term development 
in summary  the company predicts at least some growth in both sales revenues and net income during the fiscal year ended december  the following table summarizes our operating results for the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  comparison of revenue of revenue revenue cost of sales sales marketing expenses general admin

critical accounting policies and management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities

actual results may differ from these estimates because of different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations revenues revenues were  for the twelve months ended december   representing an increase of as compared to  in revenues for the corresponding period last year 
the increase is likely primarily due to the products strategy we set at the beginning of the year to supply feature rich  economically priced mid level and low end products instead of mimicking the foreign brand strategy which involves higher input costs and yields higher priced products 
for the three months ended december   our revenues declined by to  down from  in the previous year 
this decline corresponds to the decline of the global economy in the second half of  which involved a worsening job market and reduced personal income and consumer demand within the chinese economy

cost of sales for the twelve months ended december   our cost of sales was  or of revenues 
the ratio of cost of sales to revenues increased by  as compared to for the twelve months ended december  the principal reason for the increase was that both production and sales of high margin operator customized products were reduced as a result of telecom operators split and subsequent restructuring during sales and marketing expenses the company s major sales and marketing expenses are the salaries of sales personnel and the costs of marketing and transportation 
for the twelve months ended december   company sales and marketing expenses were  or of revenues a decrease of compared to analogous expenses of  or of the revenues  for the corresponding period in this decrease was caused by a reduction in personnel while changing our business model which  in turn  led to a decrease in monies needed for office expenses  transportation costs  salaries and social insurances 
in addition  the cost of after sale maintenance services was shifted to our materials suppliers  and the cost of all after sale services other than employee salaries  were borne by our cooperative partners 
this resulted in a significant reduction of our sales and marketing expenses 
research and development r d expenses our r d expenses were  or of total revenue  for the twelve months ended december   which represented a increase over the  of total revenue spent on r d during the significant increase in r d expenses was due to the company s increased investment in researching and developing g products during with the commercialization of g products  the company is expecting to launch its own g products in the market as it opens

for the twelve months ended december   the company s general and administrative expenses were  or of the total revenue  representing an increase of  or when compared with  or of the total revenues for the corresponding period in the sharp increase was primarily a result of the company granting employees stock options  which led to related compensation costs 
allowance for obsolete inventories for the twelve months ended december   the company made no allowance for obsolete inventories because the assembly  production  and materials were undertaken by the company s suppliers and the after sale servicing was performed by the company s customers  so the company did not retain any leftover or outdated handsets or products 
gross profit and gross profit margin for the twelve months ended december   our gross profit was  reflecting a decrease of   or  compared to a  gross profit for the same period of in addition  our gross profit margin for the reporting period was  representing a decrease of as compared to for the same period of the company believes that the change in its gross profit margin can be attributed to intensified competition in the domestic market and a decline in the average gross margin of products sold during the period 
when competing with foreign brands for prc customers  domestic brands usually focus on sales of low priced products as a strategy to increase their market presence and secure their traditional sales channels to create conditions for future development 
in  products that were priced below rmb  about accounted for of our total sales 
in  of our products were priced below rmb  leading us to have a gross profit margin of only in the fourth quarter 
the pending structural adjustment of chinese telecomm operators 
for the twelve months ended december   we did not receive as many high margin custom orders from telecom operators as was originally expected 
instead  we only received from that sector a small order for ultra low end cdma cell phones with a very thin gross margin from a subsidiary of china telecom 
overall  operator tailored products accounted for only of our total sales in  in  operator tailored products accounted for of our sales 
it should be noted that though our gross margin was slowing down in  it was still above 
this fact reflects our relatively stable customer group and sales channels as well as our successful product strategy 
net profit for the twelve months ended december   our net profit was  and our net profit margin was  which represents an increase of  or  compared to the  in net profit and corresponding net profit margin of earned during the same period of the company believes that this increase is attributable to our new business strategy  marketing efforts  and cost controls 
please note that in addition to operating profits  we had certain one off cancellations of debts from our suppliers in the amount of  because we were able to write off some controversial accounts payable to our suppliers in the fourth quarter of the debts were incurred at the preliminary stage of the company s development due to some confusing accounts with our suppliers 
because the debts were outstanding for long enough to fall outside the statute of limitations  they are no longer included as outstanding against the company 
excluding the earning from canceling such debts past due to our earliest suppliers  we had net profit of  and net profit margin of for the twelve months ended december   which means net profit decreased  and net profit margin decreased from the comparable figures in the fiscal year for the three months ended december   our net profit was  and out net profit margin was  representing an increase of  or  compared to the  in net profit and net profit margin of for the corresponding period of the increase of comprehensive net profit for this quarter has been greatly contributed by the reversal of certain debts up to  as we were able to cancel these debts with our old suppliers 
however  excluding this factor  our net profit decreased  to  and net profit margin decreased to from the corresponding figures for the same period in while growth has been offset by the economic downturn since june thanks to the stable growth of our sales revenues  improvement in coordination with our suppliers  and our corporate management system  in our net profit margin has been growing at a rate of least 
though the rate of increase in our net profit margin in was slightly lower than the increase in our sales revenues during  our greater than rate of increase in net profit demonstrates that our operations are stable and growing 
in  we plan to strengthen our efforts to sell products through traditional channels and will promote our business expansion within the new g network 
the company will also enhance our internal operations and management structure so we can continue to grow in the future 
liquidity and source of capital we generally finance our operations with internally generated cash flow and short term financing from domestic banks

as of december   our accounts receivable had increased by  to  as compared with  on december  the increase in accounts receivable was due mainly to company sales increases as well as and distributors business expansion leading to a reduction in their liquidity 
we will continue to pay close attention to the liquidity of our distributors 
as previously disclosed  in order to reduce the risk of default  we have limited the terms of credit offered to our major distributor in the master distributor agreement and have asked a third party surety company to guarantee the accounts receivable due from this distributor 
for additional information  please see the company s current report on its form k dated august  as of december   we had certain accounts receivable that had been outstanding for more than days because adverse macro economic development conditions had caused comparatively longer collection terms to our sales channels as a whole 
we decided it was in our best interest not to strictly enforce the terms of collection in order to maintain our current cooperation relationships  but we will modify the delivery schedule for future goods to these customers 
in this way we shall reduce the overdue accounts more than days so they only account for of the total accounts receivable by the end of the second quarter in as of december   our trade deposits paid were  which represented an increase of  as compared to  in trade deposits paid as of december  the increase was due to a larger portion of trade deposits paid over the course of the year and to early payments that went to suppliers to seek lower prices on materials or products from them

changes in currency exchange rates had caused the value of the pledged deposits to increase by  over the course of the fiscal year 
as of december   our accounts payable were  which represented an increase of  or  as compared to  in accounts payable as of december  the main reason for this increase was a higher sales volume in than in as of december   accrued expenses and liabilities were  which represented an increase of  or  as compared to the  in accrued expenses and liabilities that the company had as of december  the increase was due to an outstanding tax of  caused by differences in the timing standards for determining the value added tax vat between the usgaap and prcgaap accounting methods 
during fiscal year we made no allowance for warranty problems because  during this period  after sale services for newly launched products were undertaken by oem factories  rather than the company 
therefore  allowances were not made accordingly for these after sale services 
as of december   our taxes payable were  which represented an increase of  or  as compared to our  in taxes payable as of december  the increase was mainly due to xelent having an income tax rate of and needing to pay income taxes due in as well as taxes that were deferred from previous years

there was a change of rmb   in the aggregate amount of short term loans during fiscal year which  after converting to usd equivalents  meant the aggregate short term loans increased by  from  as of december  this increase was mainly due to the depreciation of usd against rmb 
in addition  we obtained a mortgage loan of  to purchase a company car in as of december   there was  outstanding and payable on this loan 
our gearing ratio  calculated as total debts over total assets  was  as of december  it has decreased slightly compared to as of december  contingent liabilities on june   we entered into a contract to serve as guarantor of a loan in the amount of rmb  from beijing rural bank to cect chinacom communications co  ltd

the company  in its normal course of business  is exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates with respect to bank loans 
as of december   company bank loans were  the interest rate for the twelve months ended december  was between and per annum 
currency risk the company considers rmb its functional currency since a substantial portion of the company s business activities are based in rmb 
however  the company has chosen the united states dollar as its reporting currency 
our sales and purchases are conducted within the prc in rmb 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of the rmb  there can be no assurance that its rate of exchange will not again become volatile or that the rmb will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the prc 
in addition  the rmb is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions 
transactions in currencies other than the functional currency during the period are translated into the functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange at the time of the transactions 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency are translated into functional currency at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date 
exchange gains and losses are recorded in the combined statements of operations 
for translation of financial statements into the reporting currency  assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date  equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates  and revenues  expenses  gains and losses are translated at the weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
when there are material adjustments under this process  they are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income under the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
country risk our business  assets and operations are located and conducted in the prc 
while the prc s economy has experienced significant growth in the past twenty years  growth has been uneven  both geographically and among various sectors of the economy 
the prc government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources 
some of these measures benefit the overall economy of the prc  but may also have a negative effect on us 
for example  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations applicable to us 
if there are any changes in any policies by the prc government and our business is negatively affected as a result  then our financial results  including our ability to generate revenues and profits  will also be negatively affected
