item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design and manufacture application platform solutions that enable original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and independent software vendors  or isvs that then deliver their software applications in the form of a network ready device 
application platforms are pre configured server based network infrastructure devices  engineered to deliver specific software application functionality  ease deployment challenges  improve integration and manageability  accelerate time to market and increase the security of that software application in an end user s network 
we offer our customers an extensive suite of services including solution design  integration control  global logistics  smart services  and support and maintenance 
we produce and fulfill devices branded for our customers  and derive our revenues primarily from the sale of value added hardware platforms to these customers 
our customers subsequently resell and support these platforms under their own brands to their customer bases 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made estimates and judgments in determining certain amounts included in the financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery to customers if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
in the event we have unfulfilled future obligations  revenue and related costs are deferred until those future obligations are met 
we have an inventory consignment agreement with our largest customer related to certain application platforms 
this customer notifies us when it utilizes inventory and we recognize revenues from sales to this customer based upon these notifications 
maintenance revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with the initial application platform sales and subsequent renewals 
maintenance fees are typically for one to three year renewable periods and include the right to unspecified software updates when and if available for certain agreements  hardware repairs  hour customer support  on site support  and advanced replacement of application platforms 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are included in deferred revenue 
the associated costs of maintenance are expensed in the same period as incurred 
contracts and or customer purchase orders generally serve as the evidence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and consignment usage notifications are used to verify shipment or transfer of ownership  as applicable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 

table of contents for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements  such as the sale of both product and post sales support and or extended warranty and related services element  in which software is not incidental to the product as a whole  we determine fair value based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which is typically established through contractual post sales support renewal rates whereby the residual fair value is allocated to the application platform 
for revenue arrangements that contain multiple elements in which software is not included or is incidental to the product as a whole  we allocate revenue to the extended warranty and related services element based on separately priced contractual rates for those elements 
we recognize revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for each element of the sale are met 
if we are not able to derive the fair value of the undelivered element of the sale ie maintenance  all revenues from the arrangement are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the support arrangement  which is typically one to three years 
we include shipping and handling costs reimbursed by our customers  if any  as net revenues and cost of revenues 
we record provisions for estimated sales returns in the same period the related revenues are recorded  as a reduction of revenue 
these provisions are based on historical return experience 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market value  and determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future 
any rapid technological changes and future product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
agreements with certain of our customers include inventory protection provisions  however  these provisions may not provide us with complete protection from loss due to excess or obsolete inventory 
product warranty obligations we offer a standard warranty on our products that generally provides for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue and record warranty expense as a component of cost of revenues 
costs included in our standard warranty obligation include shipping  internal and external labor  and travel 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating our warranty reserve 
although our application platform solutions primarily use standards based technologies  certain of our application platform solutions incorporate proprietary technologies  which may increase our risks related to product warranty obligations 
in the past we have experienced unexpected component failures in certain of our application platform solutions  which have required us to increase our product warranty accruals 
at the time any unexpected component failure arises  we assess the costs to repair any defects and record what we believe to be an appropriate warranty obligation based on the information available 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs associated with servicing those claims  or use estimates that prove to be materially different from actual claims  our product warranty obligations may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross profits 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize that cost as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 

table of contents we determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date using an option pricing model 
such an option pricing model requires us to make judgments for certain assumptions used  in particular  the expected term of the option and the expected volatility over that term 
for stock options granted on or after january   we determined the expected term based on analysis of our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation behavior 
for stock options granted prior to january   we determined the expected term using the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the options  also known as the simplified method 
we have determined the expected volatility based on a weighted average of the historical volatility of the market price of our common stock 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  judgment is also required to estimate forfeitures of the awards based on the probability of employees completing the required service periods 
historical forfeitures are used as a starting point for developing our estimate of future forfeitures 
goodwill and intangible assets we review long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
factors that could lead to an impairment of acquired customer relationships include a worsening in customer attrition rates compared to historical attrition rates  or lower than initially anticipated cash flows associated with customer relationships 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated over the asset s remaining life 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on the excess of the carrying value over fair value 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
during the year ended september   we performed our annual impairment review  which required us to determine the fair value of the company as a whole since it is considered the reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated 
we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing industry accepted valuation techniques that included the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and a market multiple approach  which considered our market capitalization adjusted for a control premium 
step one of this assessment resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value 
in step two of the impairment analysis  we compared the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined to be zero 
consequently  we determined that goodwill was fully impaired  resulting in an impairment charge of million for the year ended september  income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
at september   we determined that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the resulting reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit 
to the extent that net operating losses  when realized  relate to stock option deductions of approximately million  the resulting benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts management judgment is required in assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable  for which we do not require collateral 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debt write offs  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic conditions  accounts receivable aging trends and the payment terms we extend to our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  we may have to record additional allowances 
the allowance for bad debts can vary depending on the level and timing of quarterly revenues as well as the timing of the resolution of specifically reserved doubtful accounts receivable  either through collection or write off 
comparability of financial information on october   we completed our acquisition of alliance systems  which is fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  in item our financial results only include the financial results of alliance systems for periods subsequent to october  as such  the presentation of historical financial information and any discussion regarding the comparison of historical financial information does not include any financial information for alliance systems prior to october   unless otherwise indicated

discussion of fiscal years and net revenues our revenues are derived primarily from sales of application platform solutions to our oem and isv customers 
net revenues decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to decreases in sales volumes to many of our customers as a result of the global economic downturn 
these decreases were partially offset by revenues generated from 
table of contents new customer wins secured in recent periods 
sales volumes have also decreased in part due to the fact that some of our storage customers are using larger hard disk drives  enabling them to provide their customers with the same storage capacity with fewer appliances 
in addition  during fiscal year  we began transitioning away from some of our non strategic  transactional revenues to projects that are more in line with our business model 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues recognized less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of materials  manufacturing costs  warranty costs  inventory write downs  shipping and handling costs and customer support costs 
manufacturing costs are primarily comprised of compensation  contract labor costs and  when applicable  contract manufacturing costs 
gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to manufacturing costs remaining fairly constant from the prior year relative to the decrease in net revenues  changes in customer and product mix  and an increase in inventory write downs 
gross profit is affected by customer and product mix  component material costs  pricing and the volume of orders as well as by the mix of product manufactured internally compared to product manufactured by a contract manufacturer  which carries higher manufacturing costs 
in addition  during fiscal year  we won some new business which has gross margins that are lower than current levels 
we have pursued such opportunities in order to increase revenues and leverage those revenues over a fixed infrastructure to improve operating margins 
we may seek opportunities to win additional new revenues with gross margins which are lower than current levels 
operating expenses the most significant components of our operating expenses are research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses

compensation and related expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in headcount  and lower employee bonus expense 
average headcount was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year lower average headcount was primarily attributable to the completed integration of alliance systems 
employee bonuses are based on the achievement of certain targets for net revenues and results of operations 
for the year ended september   targets were partially achieved for the first half of the year  resulting in certain employee bonus payouts  which are included in compensation and related expenses 
no employee bonus expense was recorded for the year ended september  because targets for revenue and results of operations were not achieved 
stock based compensation expense decreased primarily due to variations in the timing and fair values of stock options awarded in the current year and prior years  and the periods over which the expenses related to those awards have been recognized 
our application platform development strategy emphasizes the utilization of standard component technologies  which utilize off the shelf components 
however  we expect that in some cases  significant development efforts will be required to fulfill our current and potential customers needs using customized platforms 
because prototype and consulting costs are largely project driven  we expect that these costs will be variable and could fluctuate depending on the timing and magnitude of our development projects 

table of contents selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for personnel engaged in sales and marketing  and costs associated with our marketing programs  which include costs associated with our attendance at trade shows  public relations  product literature costs  web site enhancements  and travel

travel expenses decreased primarily due to the decrease in headcount and efforts undertaken during fiscal year to reduce non essential employee travel 
the decrease in other costs was primarily driven by lower outside consulting expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  finance  information technology and human resources personnel  professional services  which include legal  accounting  audit and tax fees  and director and officer insurance

also  we incurred  in severance charges related to the termination of certain former alliance systems employees during the year ended september  the decrease in consulting and professional services expenses was primarily due to costs incurred during the year ended september  related to the acquisition and completed integration of alliance systems 
this decrease was partially offset by higher legal expenses due to the acquisition dispute and arbitration 
amortization of intangible asset amortization of the intangible asset decreased to million for the year ended september   as compared to year ended september  amortization expense for the intangible asset decreases annually over its life of years  to reflect the fact that the economic benefit expected to be received from the intangible asset declines over time 
settlement of acquisition dispute the acquisition of alliance systems was structured to include an adjustment to decrease the purchase price based on the net working capital of alliance systems as of october   as defined in the merger agreement  and therefore approximately million of the cash paid was contingently returnable to us and therefore previously recorded as contingently returnable acquisition consideration 
the former alliance systems shareholders disputed the amounts claimed by us under this provision of the merger agreement 
in september  we engaged in arbitration with the former alliance systems shareholders to resolve the disputed claims as provided for in the merger agreement 
in october  the arbitrator s decision was rendered 
as a result  approximately million of the contingently returnable consideration was returned to us from escrow funds on november   as such this amount has been recorded as refundable acquisition consideration in our consolidated balance sheet as 
table of contents of september  the  not returned to us was recorded as settlement of acquisition dispute in the fiscal year statement of operations 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net decreased to million for the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to net foreign currency exchange losses of  recorded for the year ended september   compared to net foreign currency exchange gains of  recorded during the year ended september  these gains and losses relate primarily to vat refunds receivable 
the refundable vat amounts  which we pay on products and services purchased from our contract manufacturer located in ireland  are denominated in euros 
interest income decreased by  which was attributable to lower interest rates on the cash balances held by us during the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september  provision for income taxes there was no provision for income taxes for the year ended september  because we generated a taxable loss for the year 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended september  was million  due to the taxable income generated during the year 
discussion of fiscal years and net revenues net revenues increased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to the acquisition of alliance systems on october  if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal year  net revenues would have decreased by approximately million  when comparing pro forma net revenues for the years ended september  and the pro forma decrease would have been attributable primarily to lower sales volumes during the second half of fiscal year in the years ended september  and  net revenues from sales to emc totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total net revenues  respectively 
in addition  net revenues from other customers totaled million for the year ended september  as compared to million for the year ended september  this growth was primarily attributable to the acquisition of alliance systems 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to lower gross margins associated with the alliance systems business and changes in customer and product mix

we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing industry accepted valuation techniques that included the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  and a market multiple approach  which considered our market capitalization adjusted for a control premium 
these valuation techniques require significant judgments by management  including estimates and assumptions about our projected future operating results  discount rates  and long term growth rates

in addition  we considered the expected gross margins attainable in the future and the required level of operating expenses needed to conduct our business 
step one of our impairment assessment resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value 
in step two of our impairment analysis  we compared the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value

this stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares  does not have an expiration date  and may be terminated at any time by our board of directors 
all repurchases are expected to be funded from our current cash balances or from cash generated from operations 
to facilitate repurchases of shares under this program  we have established rule b plans intended to comply with the requirements of rule b and rule b under the securities exchange act of a rule b plan permits the repurchase of shares by a company at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of company blackout periods  provided that the plan is adopted when the company is not aware of material non public information

we believe that our available cash resources  cash that we expect to generate from sales of our products  and borrowings available to us will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
in the event that our available cash resources and our silicon valley bank line of credit are not sufficient  or if an event of default occurs  such as failure to achieve certain financial covenants  that limits our ability to borrow under the line of credit  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
additional equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders 
if additional financing is needed and is not available on acceptable terms  we may need to reduce our operating expenses and scale back our operations

in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends previously issued guidance to require an entity to use an estimated selling price when vendor specific objective evidence or acceptable third party evidence does not exist for any products or services included in a multiple element arrangement 
the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the products and services based upon their relative selling prices  thus 
table of contents eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we engage in certain transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro 
these transactions may subject us to exchange rate risk based on fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which occur between the time such a transaction is recognized in our financial statements and the time that the transaction is settled 
however  based on the historical magnitudes and timing of such transactions  we do not believe we are subject to material exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
in the past  we have invested excess cash balances in cash equivalents and short term investments  and if we were to do so in the future  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
in addition  we believe that a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
