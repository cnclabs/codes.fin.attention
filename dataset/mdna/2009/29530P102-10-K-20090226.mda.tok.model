overview the discussions below focus heavily on our three segments management operations  insurance underwriting operations and investment operations 
the segment basis financial results presented throughout management s discussion and analysis herein are those which management uses internally to monitor and evaluate results and are a supplemental presentation of our consolidated statements of operations 
economic and industry wide factors because we are a management company  our earnings are driven largely by the management fee revenue we collect from the exchange that is based on the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group 
the property casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the property casualty insurance industry has been well capitalized in recent years  however  the turmoil in the securities markets  the volatile economic environment  and the return of severe tropical storm losses have all taken a toll on industry results 
conning research consulting estimates the industry combined ratio to be in  which is a deterioration from the actual industry combined ratio of in while favorable loss reserve development benefited industry underwriting results  continued price softening  high catastrophe losses and significant underwriting losses contributed to the deterioration 
these market conditions for insurers may be a precursor to increases in pricing on property and casualty policies 
conning research consulting is predicting that slower economic growth in will contribute to slow exposure growth 
while premium rates appear to be hardening  the effect of the softening economy  in terms of auto and home sales  could lead to weakness in the growth of top line premium 
the cyclical nature of the insurance industry has a direct impact on our income from management operations  as our management fee revenues are based on the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group and the 
table of contents management fee rate we charge 
periods of flattening premiums  generally result in lower margins from management operations 
our management fee revenue reflected minimal growth of in  as direct written premiums of the property and casualty group increased only compared to the property and casualty group implemented price reductions of approximately million in  however we believe our pricing will stabilize in and anticipate approximately million in direct written premium increases from rating actions taken in these increases could be offset by the effects on our business from the softening economy 
the upheaval in the financial markets in the third and fourth quarters of had a negative impact on our investment operations 
what began in the second half of as a subprime mortgage crisis has grown to a global crisis in the financial markets 
we record impairment writedowns on investments in instances where the fair value of the investment is substantially below cost  and we conclude that the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
impairment charges were also affected by our proactive tax strategies which precluded us from asserting our intent to hold these investments to recovery 
during  we impaired million of securities primarily for investments in the banking and finance industries 
included in the total impairment charge were million in charges on fixed maturities and million in charges on preferred stock 
the exchange also recognized substantial impairment charges in of million with million in bonds  million in preferred stock and million in common stock 
many of these securities are performing in line with anticipated or contractual cash flows 
the valuation of our entire investment portfolio was significantly affected by the upheaval in the financial markets 
net unrealized losses on fixed maturities at december  were million compared with million in net unrealized gains at december   with unrealized losses in the financial sector being the primary driver 
there were also million in net unrealized losses in equity securities at december  compared with million at december  our trading securities portfolio was similarly affected  with a net unrealized loss of million at december  compared to a million gain at december  our alternative investments were also impacted by the market declines 
equity in earnings of limited partnerships decreased million in over the valuation adjustments in the limited partnerships are based on information received from our general partners  which is generally received on a quarter lag 
as a result  the partnership earnings do not reflect the valuation changes that were impacted by the upheaval in the financial markets in the fourth quarter of revenue generation we have three primary sources of revenue 
our most significant source of revenue is generated by providing management services to the exchange 
the management fee is calculated as a percentage  not to exceed  of the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group 
the board of directors establishes the rate at least annually and considers such factors as relative financial strength of the exchange and company and projected revenue streams 
our board set the rate at  its maximum level 
second  we generate revenues from our property casualty insurance subsidiaries  which consist of our share of the pooled underwriting results of the property and casualty group 
all members of the property and casualty group pool their underwriting results 
under the pooling agreement  the exchange assumes of the property and casualty group s net written premium 
through the pool  our subsidiaries  erie insurance company and erie insurance company of new york  currently assume of the property and casualty group s net written premium  providing a direct incentive for us to manage the insurance underwriting discipline as effectively as possible 
finally  we generate revenues from our fixed maturity  equity and alternative investment portfolios 
the portfolios are managed with a view toward maximizing after tax yields and limiting credit risk  and we actively evaluate our portfolios for impairments 
due to the global liquidity crises surrounding the credit markets and more broadly the financial services industry in  we recognized million of impairment charges as a result of continued declines in fair value and credit deterioration on certain of our bonds and preferred stocks predominately in the banking and finance industry sectors 
the majority of the impairments relate to securities that are artificially depressed due to current market conditions  but continue to meet interest and dividend obligations 
we also had net losses on common stocks of million and reduced valuation adjustments recorded by our real estate limited partnerships as a result of the general slow down and recent economic downturn in the real estate markets 
we have consistently generated high levels of cash flows from operations  which amounted to million in our net cash flows from operations have been used to pay shareholder dividends and to repurchase shares of our stock under our repurchase program 

table of contents opportunities  challenges and risks in order to grow our management fee revenue  our key challenges in will be to continue to generate profitable property casualty revenue growth while containing the growth of expenses in our management operations 
expense management is further challenged by our need to enhance technology and improve ease of doing business for our agents and policyholders 
we continued to pursue opportunities in our current territories through the appointment of new agencies in during  we plan to continue this momentum by appointing another agencies 
we continued to develop the personal lines pricing plan  by introducing additional variables that further segment risks and allow us to be price competitive for the best risks 
the property and casualty group continues to evaluate potential new product offerings and product extensions to meet consumer demands 
we plan to continue to control the growth in the cost of management operations by controlling salary and wage costs and other discretionary spending in however  we also intend to continue making targeted investments in technology to enhance customer service  ease of doing business with our agents and customers  and to improve our productivity 
in  we expect to incur additional expenses on our various technology initiatives aimed at improving our competitiveness

financial overview years ended december  change change over over in thousands  except per share data income from management operations underwriting income net loss revenue from investment operations  nm   income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net income per share diluted nm not meaningful key points decrease in net income per share diluted in was driven by net realized losses on investments as a result of the upheaval in the financial markets  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of in the year  we recognized million of impairment charges on fixed maturities and preferred stock  million of net realized losses on common stock and a drop in our equity in earnings of limited partnerships of million 
gross margins from management operations decreased slightly to in from in gaap combined ratios of the insurance underwriting operations increased to in from in driven by slightly higher catastrophe losses and less favorable development of prior accident year loss reserves when compared to results 
management operations management fee revenue increased and in and  respectively 
the two determining factors of management fee revenue are the management fee rate we charge  and the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group 
the management fee rate was for both and direct written premiums of the property and casualty group were largely unchanged at billion for and in  the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group increased compared to a decline in new policy direct written premiums of the property and casualty group increased in compared to in  while renewal premiums increased in compared to a decline of in new business policies in force increased in compared to in  and renewal business policies in force increased in compared to in despite the growth in policies in force  rate reductions of million led to minimal growth in  and rate reductions of million contributed to the decline in 
table of contents the cost of management operations increased  or million  to million in  primarily due to the increase in non commission expenses commissions total commission costs decreased  or million  to million in driven by a decrease in agent bonuses as a result of a reduction in the profitability component of the award 
offsetting this reduction were increases in normal scheduled rate commissions  a private passenger auto bonus and other promotional incentives classified as commissions 
total costs other than commissions all other non commission expense increased  to million in  driven by personnel  sales and policy issuance costs and other operating costs 
personnel costs increased primarily due to higher average pay rates and higher staffing levels coupled with increases in executive severance costs and management incentive plan expense 
sales and policy issuance costs rose due to increased agent advertising program expense 
other operating costs increased due to various corporate technology initiatives that resulted in additional contract labor fees and software costs 
insurance underwriting operations contributing to underwriting income of million and a gaap combined ratio in  compared to underwriting income of million and an gaap combined ratio in  were the following factors catastrophe losses totaling points  or million  in due to remnants of hurricane ike in ohio  pennsylvania and indiana  compared to points  or million  in  and favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves of points  or million  in  compared to points  or million  of favorable development in  and increase in the underlying non catastrophe accident year combined ratio as a result of slightly declining average premiums and increased loss costs 
investment operations net investment income decreased in compared to  as invested assets declined in to fund stock repurchases of million 
net realized losses on investments totaled million in compared to realized losses of million primarily due to impairment charges on fixed maturities and preferred stock of million and net realized losses on common stock of million 
equity in earnings of limited partnerships decreased to million in from million in as a result of fair value declines across all limited partnerships categories due to lingering anemic financial market conditions 
equity in efl losses was million in compared to earnings of million in efl recognized impairment charges of million in primarily related to fixed maturities and preferred stock investments in the financial services industry sector  of which our share was million 
the topics addressed in this overview are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 
critical accounting estimates in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment 
if actual events differ 
table of contents significantly from the underlying assumptions  there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually  and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings 
investment valuation we make estimates concerning the valuation of all investments 
valuation techniques used to derive fair value of our available for sale and trading securities are based on observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  such as prices obtained from nationally recognized pricing services for identical instruments in active markets 
observable inputs other than quoted prices would include prices obtained from third party pricing services that model prices based on observable inputs 
unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions regarding exit market pricing for these securities 
fair value for these securities  that comprise only of our total investment portfolio  are determined using comparable securities or valuations received from outside broker dealers 
investments are evaluated monthly for other than temporary impairment loss 
some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other than temporary include the extent and duration for which fair value is less than cost  historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer  short and long term prospects of the issuer and its industry based on analysts recommendations  specific events that occurred affecting the issuer  including rating downgrades  and our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value 
an investment deemed other than temporarily impaired is written down to its estimated fair value 
impairment charges are included as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests is financial statements prepared by the general partner 
because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements  the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners generally result in a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our consolidated statements of operations 
due to this delay  these financial statements do not reflect the volatility in market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter we expect additional deterioration to be reflected in the general partners year end financial statements  which we will receive in  and such declines could be significant 
nearly all of the underlying investments in our limited partnerships are valued using a source other than quoted prices in active markets 
our limited partnership holdings are considered investment companies where the general partners record assets at fair value 
several factors are to be considered in determining whether an entity is an investment company 
among these factors are a large number of investors  low level of individual ownership and passive ownership that indicate the entity is an investment company 
we have three types of limited partnership investments private equity  mezzanine debt and real estate 
our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are diversified among numerous industries and geographies to minimize potential loss exposure 
the fair value amounts for our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are based on the financial statements of the general partners  who use various methods to estimate fair value including the market approach  income approach and the cost approach 
the market approach uses prices and other pertinent information from market generated transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
such valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a single discounted present value amount 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
the cost approach is derived from the amount that is currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset 
if information becomes available that would impair the cost of investments owned by the partnerships  then the general partner would generally adjust to the net realizable value 
real estate limited partnerships are recorded by the general partner at fair value based on independent appraisals and or internal valuations 
real estate projects under development are generally valued at cost and impairment tested by the general partner 
we minimize the risk of market decline by avoiding concentration in a particular geographic area and are diversified across residential  commercial  industrial and retail real estate investments 

table of contents we perform various procedures in review of the general partners valuations  and while we rely on the general partners financial statements as the best available information to record our share of the partnership unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuation changes  we adjust our financial statements for impairments of the partnership investment where appropriate 
as there is no ready market for these investments  they have the greatest potential for variability 
we survey each of the general partners quarterly about expected significant changes plus or minus compared to previous quarter to valuations prior to the release of the fund s quarterly and annual financial statements 
based on that information from the general partner  we consider whether recording of a valuation adjustment or additional disclosure is warranted 
property casualty insurance liabilities reserves for property casualty insurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect our best estimate of future amounts needed to pay losses and related expenses with respect to insured events 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported 
they also include estimates of all future payments associated with processing and settling these claims 
reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims 
case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claims 
incurred but not reported reserves represent the difference between the actual reported loss and loss adjustment expenses and the estimated ultimate cost of all claims 
the process of estimating the liability for property casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is complex and involves a variety of actuarial techniques 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past development trends are an appropriate indicator of future events 
reserve estimates are based on our assessment of known facts and circumstances  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by internal factors  including changes in claims handling procedures and changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process  and external events  such as economic inflation  regulatory and legislative changes 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used  final loss settlements may vary significantly from the current estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
our actuaries review reserve estimates for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data  on a quarterly basis  for all direct reserves except the reserves for the pre automobile catastrophic injury claims and the workers compensation catastrophic injury claims that are reviewed semi annually 
these catastrophic injury reserves are reviewed semi annually because of the relatively low number of cases and the long term nature of these claims 
for reserves that are reviewed semi annually  our actuaries monitor the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters to either confirm that the estimate of ultimate losses should not change  or if necessary  perform a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change 
significant changes to the factors discussed above  which are either known or reasonably projected through analysis of internal and external data  are quantified in the reserve estimates each quarter 
the quarterly reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis 
the various methods generate different estimates of ultimate losses by product line and product coverage combination 
thus  there are no reserve ranges  but rather point estimates of the ultimate losses developed from the various methods 
the methods that are considered more credible vary by product coverage combination based primarily on the maturity of the accident quarter  the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the method 
paid loss development patterns  generated from historical data  are generally less useful for the more recent accident quarters of long tailed lines since a low percentage of ultimate losses are paid in early periods of development 
reported loss including cumulative paid losses and case reserves development patterns  generated from historical data  estimate only the unreported losses rather than the total unpaid losses as this technique is affected by changes in case reserving practices 
combinations of the paid and reported methods are used in developing estimated ultimate losses for short tail coverages  such as private passenger auto property and homeowners claims  and more mature accident quarters of long tail coverages  such as private passenger auto liability claims and commercial liability claims  including workers compensation 
the bornhuetter ferguson method combines a reported development technique with an expected loss ratio technique 
an expected loss ratio is developed through a review of historical loss ratios by accident quarter  as well as expected changes to earned premium  mix of business and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the accident quarter being evaluated 
this method is generally used on the first four to eight accident quarters on long tail coverages because a low percentage of losses are paid in the early period of development 

table of contents the reserve review process involves a comprehensive review by our actuaries of the various estimation methods and reserve levels produced by each 
these multiple reserve point estimates are reviewed by our reserving actuaries and reserve best estimates are selected 
the selected reserve estimates are discussed with management 
numerous factors are considered in setting reserve levels  including  but not limited to  the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications  the maturity of the accident year  pertinent claims frequency and severity trends observed over recent years  the level of volatility within a particular line of business and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to prior periods 
we also perform analyses to evaluate the adequacy of past reserve levels 
using subsequent information  we perform retrospective reserve analyses to test whether previously established estimates for reserves were reasonable 
our retrospective reserve analysis indicated the property and casualty group s december  direct reserves  excluding salvage and subrogation recoveries  had an estimated redundancy of approximately million  which was of reserves 
the property and casualty group reduced reserves related to automobile bodily injury bi and uninsured underinsured motorist um uim bodily injury by approximately million in this change in estimate resulted from improvements in frequency trends  and to a lesser extent  severity trends  that developed primarily on and accident years 
the property and casualty group s reserves for auto bi and um uim were million at december  and million at december  the pre automobile catastrophic injury reserves were reduced by approximately million in this change in estimate resulted from lower than expected future attendant care costs and affected various accident years before these reserve estimates were reduced to reflect reduced attendant care costs on these claims 
the additional data was incorporated in the reserve estimates as it became known in each quarter throughout the property and casualty group had pre automobile catastrophic injury reserves of million at december  and million at december   which are net of million and million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables for and  respectively 
in and  the property and casualty group s direct reserves had an estimated redundancy at december of million  or of reserves  and million  or of reserves  respectively 
the favorable frequency and severity trends in automobile bi and um uim began in and these trends developed more fully in in  the trends reflected in the activity were incorporated into our reserve estimates 
the property and casualty group s coverage with the greatest potential for variation are the catastrophic injury liability reserves 
the automobile no fault law in pennsylvania before and workers compensation policies provide for unlimited medical benefits 
the estimate of ultimate liabilities for these claims is subject to significant judgment due to variations in claimant health  mortality over time and health care cost trends 
workers compensation catastrophic injury claims have been segregated from the total population of workers compensation claims 
because the coverage related to the automobile no fault and workers compensation claims is unique and the number of claims is about  the previously discussed methods are not used  rather ultimate losses are estimated on a claim by claim basis 
an annual payment assumption is made for each of these claimants who sustained catastrophic injuries and then projected into the future based upon a particular assumption of the future inflation rate  including medical inflation and life expectancy of the claimant 
the most significant variable in estimating this liability is medical cost inflation 
our medical inflation rate assumption in setting this reserve for is for a annual increase grading down after the first year  then grading down per year to an ultimate rate of 
our medical inflation rate assumption in setting this reserve for was a annual increase grading down per year to an ultimate rate of 
the life expectancy assumption mortality underlying this reserve estimate reflects experience to date 
our mortality rate assumption gives weight to our own mortality experience and weight to a disabled pensioner mortality table 
our actual mortality experience for disabled lives of catastrophically injured people is based on a relatively small number of lives 
we believe weighting the mortality assumption to incorporate the disabled pensioner mortality table  which has longer life expectancies than our experience  is reasonable in estimating our ultimate liability for these claims 
actual experience  different than that assumed  could have a significant impact on the reserve estimate 
at december   the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for the pre automobile catastrophic injury liabilities  which is our best estimate of this liability at this time  was million  which is net of million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
our property casualty subsidiaries share of the net 
table of contents automobile catastrophic injury liability reserve is million at december  each basis point change in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in a change in net liability for us of million 
at december   the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for workers compensation catastrophic injury reserves  which is our best estimate of this liability at this time  was million  which is net of million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
our property casualty insurance subsidiaries share of the workers compensation catastrophic injury reserves is million at december  each basis point change in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in a change in net liability for us of million 
retirement benefit plans our pension plan for employees is the largest and only funded benefit plan we offer 
our pension and other retirement benefit obligations are developed from actuarial estimates in accordance with financial accounting standard sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets 
we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience  current market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  and expected future trends 
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments 
we discount those cash payments using the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
in determining the discount rate  we performed a bond matching study 
the study developed a portfolio of non callable bonds rated aa or higher with at least million outstanding at december  these bonds had maturities primarily between zero and thirty years 
for years beyond year  there were no bonds maturing 
in these instances  the study estimated the appropriate bond by assuming that there would be bonds available with the same characteristics as the available bond maturing in the immediately preceding year 
outlier bonds were excluded from the study 
the cash flows from the bonds were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan  which have a duration of about years 
this bond matching study supported the selection of a discount rate for the pension expense 
the expense was based on a discount rate assumption of 
a change of basis points in the discount rate assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million impact on net pension and other retirement benefit costs in  before consideration of expense allocation to affiliates 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over a year period  which represents the expected remaining service period of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation on the statements of financial position and accumulated other comprehensive income in in accordance with fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
these amounts are systematically recognized as an increase to future net periodic pension expense in accordance with fas in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected long term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions  as there are typically not significant changes in the asset mix 
the long term rate of return is based on historical long term returns for asset classes included in the pension plan s target allocation 
a reasonably possible change of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million impact on net pension benefit cost before consideration of reimbursement from affiliates 
we use a four year averaging method to determine the market related value of plan assets  which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense 
under this methodology  asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market related value of assets on a level basis over a four year period 
the component of the actuarial loss generated during that related to the actual investment return being different from assumed during the prior year was million 
recognition of this loss will be deferred over a four year period  consistent with the market related asset value methodology 
once factored into the market related asset value  these experience losses will be amortized over a period of years  which is the remaining service period of the employee group 

table of contents the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining our pension and retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations
