risk factors 
an investment in capitol s common stock is subject to the risks inherent to capitol s business 
the material risks and uncertainties that capitol believes affect it are described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones capitol faces 
additional risks and uncertainties that capitol is not aware of or focused on  or risks currently deemed immaterial  may also impair business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  capitol s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of capitol s common stock could decline significantly  and shareholders could lose all or a portion of their investment 
capitol s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
since december  the united states has been in a recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are experiencing serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
unemployment has increased significantly 
since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to all mortgage and real estate asset classes  to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset classes  including equity securities 
global markets have been characterized by substantially increased volatility  short selling and an overall loss of investor confidence  initially in financial institutions  but more recently in companies in a number of other industries and in the broader markets 
market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent financial institutions 
financial institution failures or near failures have resulted in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties 
furthermore  declining asset values  defaults on mortgages and consumer loans  and the lack of market and investor confidence  as well as other factors  have all combined to increase credit default swap spreads  to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings  and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity  despite very significant declines in federal reserve borrowing rates and other government actions 
some banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses and have become reluctant to lend  even on a secured basis  due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral 
the foregoing has significantly weakened the strength and liquidity of some financial institutions worldwide 
in  the us government  the federal reserve board and other regulatory agencies took numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence  including investing approximately billion in the equity of other banking organizations  but asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to be very limited 
capitol s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of its banks borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where capitol operates and in the united states as a whole 
the current recession is characterized by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  falling commercial and residential real estate values  inactive or nonexistent markets for the sale of real estate  or a combination of these or other factors 
overall  during  the business environment was adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
the business environment outside of michigan and in some other markets in which capitol operates has been less adverse than in the united states generally but continues to deteriorate 
it is expected that the business environment in the united states and worldwide will continue to deteriorate for the foreseeable future 
there item a 
risk factors continued 
can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term 
such conditions have and could continue to adversely affect the credit quality of capitol s loans  results of operations and financial condition 
young banks are likely to incur significant operating losses that could negatively affect the availability of earnings to support future growth 
many of capitol s bank subsidiaries are less than three years old 
capitol engaged in significant new bank development activity in recent periods 
young banks are expected to incur operating losses in their early periods of operation because of an inability to generate sufficient net interest income to cover operating costs and may never become profitable 
those operating losses can be significant and can occur for longer periods than planned depending upon the ability to control operating expenses and generate net interest income  which could affect the availability of earnings retained to support future growth 
if capitol is unable to manage its growth  its ability to provide quality services to customers could be impaired and cause its customer and employee relations to suffer 
capitol has rapidly and significantly expanded its operations in recent periods 
capitol s rapid growth has placed significant demands on its management and other resources 
to manage its growth  capitol will need to attract  hire and retain highly skilled and motivated officers and employees and improve existing systems and or implement new systems for transaction processing  operational and financial management  and training  integrating and managing capitol s growing employee base 
capitol s banks small size may make it difficult to compete with larger institutions because capitol is not able to compete in the offering of significantly larger loans 
capitol endeavors to capitalize its newly formed banks with a moderate dollar amount permitted by regulatory agencies 
as a result  the legal lending limits of capitol s banks severely constrain the size of loans that those banks can make 
in addition  many of the banks competitors have significantly larger capitalization and  hence  an ability to make significantly larger loans 
the inability to offer larger loans limits the revenues that can be earned from interest amounts charged on larger loan balances 
capitol s banks are intended to be small in size 
most operate from single locations 
they are small relative to the dynamic markets in which they operate 
each of those markets has a variety of large and small competitors that have resources far beyond those of capitol s banks 
while it is the intention of capitol s banks to operate as niche players within their geographic markets  their continued existence is dependent upon being able to attract and retain loan customers in those large markets that are dominated by substantially larger regulated and unregulated financial institutions 
if capitol cannot recruit additional highly qualified personnel  capitol s customer service could suffer  causing its customer base to decline 
capitol s strategy is also dependent upon its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for such employees among financial institutions is intense 
availability of personnel with appropriate community banking experience varies 
if capitol does not succeed in attracting new employees or retaining and motivating current and future employees  capitol s business could suffer significantly 
item a 
risk factors continued 
capitol and its banks operate in an environment highly regulated by state and federal government  changes in federal and state banking laws and regulations could have a negative impact on capitol s business 
as a bank holding company  capitol is regulated primarily by the federal reserve board 
capitol s current bank affiliates are regulated primarily by the state banking regulators  the fdic  the ots and  in the case of one national bank  the occ 
various federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous aspects of the banks operations  including adequate capital and financial condition  permissible types and amounts of extensions of credit and investments  permissible nonbanking activities  and restrictions on dividend payments 
federal and state regulatory agencies have broad discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies 
capitol and its banks also undergo periodic examinations by one or more regulatory agencies 
following such examinations  capitol may be required  among other things  to change its asset valuations or the amounts of required loan loss allowances or to restrict its operations 
those actions would result from the regulators judgments based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the banks operations are required to follow a wide variety of state and federal consumer protection and similar statutes and regulations 
federal and state regulatory restrictions limit the manner in which capitol and its banks may conduct business and obtain financing 
those laws and regulations can and do change significantly from time to time  and any such change could adversely affect capitol 
the banks allowances for loan losses may prove inadequate to absorb actual loan losses  which may adversely impact net income or increase operating losses 
capitol believes that its consolidated allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolios at the balance sheet date 
management s estimates are used to determine the allowance and are based on historical loss experience  specific problem loans  value of underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
these estimates are subjective and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events 
actual future losses may differ from current estimates 
depending on changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that are generally beyond capitol s control  actual loan losses could increase significantly 
as a result  such losses could exceed current allowance estimates 
no assurance can be provided that the allowance will be sufficient to cover actual future loan losses should such losses be realized 
loan loss experience  which is helpful in estimating the requirements for the allowance for loan losses at any given balance sheet date  has been minimal at many of capitol s banks 
because many of capitol s banks are young  they do not have seasoned loan portfolios and it is likely that the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans may need to be increased in future periods as the loan portfolios become more mature and loss experience evolves 
if it becomes necessary to increase the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  such increases would be accomplished through higher provisions for loan losses  which may adversely impact net income or increase operating losses and could result in net losses on a consolidated basis 
the domestic economy is in a severe recession and capitol s levels of nonperforming loans have increased significantly 
capitol s loan losses increased significantly in it is anticipated that levels of nonperforming loans and related loan losses will continue to increase as economic conditions  locally and nationally  evolve 
item a 
risk factors continued 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their supervisory functions  periodically review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
regulatory agencies may require capitol or its banks to increase their provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs based upon judgments different from those of management 
any increase in the allowance required by regulatory agencies could have a negative impact on capitol s operating results 
loan origination activities  for both commercial and residential mortgages  involve collateral valuation risks and the risk of the subsequent identification of origination fraud or other losses which could exceed capitol s allowance for loan losses 
capitol s banks use an enterprise wide loan policy which provides for conservative loan to value guidelines when loans are originated 
in today s difficult real estate economy in many parts of the country  falling property values and significant foreclosure activity of both residential and commercial real estate property are resulting in significant loan losses at many financial institutions  including capitol 
further  although most residential mortgage loans originated by capitol s banks have been sold away to investors  if it is subsequently determined that such loans were originated with any element of alleged fraud  such as exaggerated borrower income or assets  for example  the originating institution may be liable for any losses with such loans and may have to buy back those loans 
the potential for additional loan losses from valuation issues or fraud is unknown 
fraud risks are particularly difficult to identify and quantify  especially when the duration of the risk is the same as the term of the loan  often as long as years or more 
occurrences of fraud are often more prevalent during an economic downturn or recession 
potential losses from valuation issues or occurrences of fraud could significantly exceed capitol s allowance for loan losses  adversely affecting capitol s profitability 
new accounting or tax pronouncements or interpretations may be issued by the accounting standard setters  regulators or other government bodies which could change existing accounting methods 
changes in accounting methods could negatively impact capitol s results of operations and financial condition 
current accounting and tax rules  standards  policies  and interpretations influence the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
events that may not have a direct impact on capitol  such as the bankruptcy of major us companies  have resulted in legislators  regulators  and authoritative bodies  such as the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  the public company accounting oversight board  and various taxing authorities responding by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
a change in accounting standards may adversely affect reported financial condition and results of operations 
capitol s business continuity plans or data security systems could prove to be inadequate  resulting in a material interruption in  or disruption to  its business and a negative impact on the results of operations 
capitol relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems  whether due to severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  criminal activity or other factors  could result in failures or disruptions in general ledger  deposit  loan  customer relationship management and other systems 
while capitol has disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of capitol s information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of capitol s information systems could damage the reputation of capitol and its banks  result in a loss of customer business  subject capitol and its subsidiary banks to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose capitol to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on capitol s results of operations 
item a 
risk factors continued 
capitol could face unanticipated environmental liabilities or costs related to real property owned or acquired through foreclosure 
compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those related to investigation and clean up of contaminated sites  could have a negative effect on expenses and results of operations 
a significant portion of capitol s affiliate banks loan portfolio are secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  capitol s affiliate banks may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  capitol s affiliate banks may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require capitol s affiliate banks to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit capitol s affiliate banks ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase capitol s affiliate banks exposure to environmental liability 
although capitol s affiliate banks have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
capitol s commercial loan concentration to small businesses and collateralized by commercial real estate increases the risk of defaults by borrowers and substantial credit losses could result  causing shareholders to lose their investment in capitol s common stock 
capitol s banks make various types of loans  including commercial  consumer  residential mortgage and construction loans 
capitol s strategy emphasizes lending to small businesses and other commercial enterprises 
capitol typically uses commercial real estate as a source of collateral for many of its loans 
recently  regulatory agencies have expressed concern with banks having large concentrations in commercial real estate due to the recent downturn in the real estate market in certain areas of the country  leading to increased risk of credit loss and extended periods of sale 
loans to small and medium sized businesses are generally riskier than single family mortgage loans 
typically  the success of a small or medium sized business depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business 
in addition  small and medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial variations in operating results  any of which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan 
during  due to borrower performance difficulties and adverse real estate market conditions  levels of nonperforming loans  foreclosures and loan losses increased significantly at capitol  resulting from the current severe recessionary environment 
substantial further credit losses could result  causing shareholders to lose their entire investment in capitol s common stock 
actions by the open market committee of the federal reserve board frbomc may adversely affect capitol s net interest income 
changes in net interest income 
capitol s profitability is significantly dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
therefore  any change in general market interest rates  whether as a result of changes in monetary policies of the federal reserve board or otherwise  can have a significant effect on net interest income 
capitol s assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristic of assets and liabilities 
as a result  changes in interest rates can affect net interest income in either a positive or negative way 
recently  the frbomc has decreased interest rates to an unprecedented level to near zero 
future stability of interest rates and frbomc policy  which impact such rates  are uncertain 
item a 
risk factors continued 
changes in the yield curve 
changes in the difference between short and long term interest rates  commonly known as the yield curve  may also harm capitol s business 
for example  short term deposits may be used to fund longer term loans 
when differences between short term and long term interest rates shrink or disappear  the spread between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly  decreasing net interest income 
capitol relies on dividends from its wholly owned subsidiaries 
capitol is a separate and distinct legal entity from its wholly owned subsidiaries 
it receives dividends from its subsidiaries to help pay interest and principal on its debt obligations 
capitol does not own  directly or indirectly  all of the equity of all of its subsidiaries 
capitol currently does not rely on dividends from partially owned subsidiaries 
to the extent any partially owned subsidiaries do pay dividends or make distributions  the other holders of equity will participate pro rata with capitol 
various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the banks and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to the holding company 
in the event the banks are unable to pay sufficient dividends to capitol  it may not be able to service its debt obligations or pay its other obligations 
the inability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on capitol s business  financial condition and results of operations 
capitol may participate in the us treasury s capital purchase program which may be dilutive to capitol s common stock 
the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa enacted by the us congress in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions was signed into law on october  on october   the us department of treasury us treasury announced the troubled asset relief program s capital purchase program tarp 
this program made billion of capital available to us financial institutions from the initial billion authorized by the eesa in the form of preferred stock investments by the us treasury under the following general terms the preferred stock issued to the us treasury would pay dividends for the first five years  and then dividends thereafter  in connection with the purchase of preferred stock  the us treasury will receive warrants entitling the us treasury to buy the participating institution s common stock equivalent in value to of the preferred stock  the preferred stock may not be redeemed for a period of three years  except with proceeds from high quality private capital  the consent of the us treasury will be required to increase common dividends per share or any share repurchases  with limited exceptions  during the first three years  unless the preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred to third parties  and participating companies must adopt the u 
s treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the us treasury holds the equity issued under the tarp 
on october   capitol submitted an application to sell up to million in preferred stock to the us treasury 
if capitol s application is approved and its board of directors determines to move forward with participation in the program  it would  as previously stated  generally be prohibited from increasing the dividend paid on the shares of its common stock or repurchasing any shares of its common stock  for three years after the preferred stock is sold  unless capitol obtains the us treasury s prior consent 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that capitol will increase  or even pay  dividends on the shares of its common stock 
item a 
risk factors continued 
in addition  participation on the terms set forth in cpp would require capitol to issue a year warrant permitting the us treasury to purchase up to million in shares of capitol s common stock  which would be immediately exercisable 
the proceeds from these transactions would be allocated on a relative fair value basis between the preferred stock and the warrant purchased by the us treasury 
the preferred stock and the warrant would both be classified in stockholders equity in capitol s consolidated balance sheet 
the issuance of the preferred stock and the warrant issued by the u 
s 
treasury  including preferred stock dividends  would result in a reduction of basic and diluted earnings per common share 
on february   the us treasury announced its new capital assistance program cap under which us banking organizations may apply for a us treasury investment in mandatorily convertible preferred stock in an amount of up to or of risk weighted assets 
the purpose of the cap is to provide eligible banking organizations with capital in the form of a preferred security which is convertible into common equity 
participating banking organizations would also issue warrants to the us treasury 
eligibility will be consistent with the criteria and deliberative process established under the tarp cpp 
the cap is open immediately and the application deadline for participation is in may capitol has not yet determined whether it will submit a cap application 
capitol s participation in the cpp or cap would have a dilutive effect on capitol s common stock 
there is no assurance capitol will be approved to participate in the tarp or  if approved  whether it will choose to participate 
capitol has trust preferred securities outstanding which may prohibit future cash dividends on capitol s common stock or otherwise adversely affect regulatory capital compliance 
capitol also has several series of trust preferred securities outstanding  with a liquidation amount totaling about million  which are treated as capital for regulatory ratio compliance purposes 
although these securities are viewed as capital for regulatory purposes  they are debt securities which have numerous covenants and other provisions which  in the event of noncompliance  could have an adverse effect on capitol and or the value of the trust preferred securities 
for example  these securities permit capitol to defer the periodic payment of interest of up to twenty consecutive quarters  however  if such payments are deferred  capitol is prohibited from paying cash dividends on its common stock during deferral periods and until accumulated deferred interest is paid 
future payment of interest on the trust preferred securities is dependent upon capitol s bank subsidiaries earnings and dividends  which may be inadequate to service the obligations 
capitol s board of directors could elect to defer or regulatory agencies could require capitol to defer the payment of interest as is permitted under the terms of the trust preferred securities 
continued classification of these securities as elements of capital for regulatory purposes is subject to future changes in regulatory rules and regulations and the actions of regulatory agencies  all of which is beyond the control or influence of capitol 
capitol s banks have restricted investments in federal home loan banks which may be subject to future impairment 
as of december   capitol s banks had investments in several federal home loan banks approximating million 
such investments are restricted securities which may be redeemed only by the issuer 
future redemption of the securities is subject to the issuer s liquidity and capital adequacy which are  in part  dependent upon valuation of the issuer s significant mortgage backed securities portfolios 
capitol s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented  which could have a material adverse effect on capitol s business  results of operations and financial condition 
capitol regularly reviews and updates its internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
item a 
risk factors continued 
any failure or circumvention of controls and procedures  or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures  could have a material adverse effect on capitol s business  results of operations and financial condition 
capitol s bylaws  as well as certain banking laws  may have an anti takeover effect 
provisions of capitol s bylaws  the michigan control share act  and certain federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire capitol  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to shareholders 
the combination of these provisions effectively inhibits a non negotiated merger or other business combination which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of capitol s common stock 
capitol s bank subsidiaries have decentralized management which could have a negative impact on the rate of growth and profitability of capitol and its bank subsidiaries 
capitol s bank subsidiaries have independent boards of directors and management teams 
this decentralized structure gives the banks control over the day to day management of the institution  including credit decisions  the selection of personnel  the pricing of loans and deposits  marketing decisions and the strategy in handling problem loans 
this decentralized structure may impact capitol s ability to uniformly implement corporate or enterprise wide strategy at the bank level 
it may slow capitol s ability to react to changes in strategic direction due to outside factors such as interest rate changes and changing economic conditions 
this decentralized structure may cause additional management time to be spent on internal issues and could negatively impact the growth and profitability of the banks individually and the parent company
