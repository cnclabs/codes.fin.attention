item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions as described under the note regarding forward looking statements that appears earlier in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  sell and support precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe card products and solutions 
semiconductor manufacturers use our wafer probe cards to perform wafer sort and test on the semiconductor die  or chips  or the whole semiconductor wafer  which is prior to singulation of the wafer into individual separate chips 
we work closely with our customers to design  develop and manufacture custom wafer probe cards 
each wafer probe card is a custom product that is specific to the chip and wafer designs of the customer 
we operate in a single industry segment and have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards incorporating our proprietary microspring interconnect technology 
the oversupply of memory devices in the early part of our fiscal  coupled with the overall global economic downturn and uncertainty in fiscal had a significant impact on global semiconductor device manufacturing  which resulted in a significant decrease in demand and a challenging environment for our advanced wafer probe cards 
our revenues declined by  or million  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this revenue decline was in each of the product markets we address dynamic random access memory  or dram  nand and nor flash memory and system on a chip  or soc 
these results were due to a number of factors including the relative supply and demand of various semiconductor devices and end products incorporating those devices  semiconductor manufacturers efforts to curtail spending and conserve cash by taking capacity offline  reducing production  delaying the transition to new technology nodes and postponing the implementation of tooling cycles 
we expect the deteriorated market conditions for our semiconductor customers to continue or worsen in fiscal  which could cause our dram based revenue to further decline in light of the protracted oversupply of dram devices  the delay of probe card purchases by some of our dram customers and the delay of technology transitions by some of our dram customers 
we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal as compared to net income of million for fiscal  primarily due to lower revenues  the inclusion of million of restructuring charges  million of impairment charges related to long lived assets  and million in provision for bad debt reserve due to the heightened risk of non payment of certain accounts receivable 
we implemented two cost reduction plans in fiscal which consisted primarily of global workforce reductions  facility consolidation  and property and equipment impairments 
we expect continued decline in demand for our products that address the dram  flash and soc markets to persist which will affect our revenues and profitability into fiscal given the overall weakness of the united states economy and the global macroeconomy  and the current downturn in the semiconductor industry and its effects on demand for our products  we are unable to precisely forecast when or if revenues and profitability will return to previous levels 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately million as of december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances was primarily due to the use of cash for operating 
table of contents activities in fiscal we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
if we are unsuccessful in improving our operating efficiency  reducing our cash outlays or increasing our available cash through financing  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will further decline in the first quarter of fiscal in response to the continued deterioration in semiconductor market conditions  we are focusing on aligning our operations and improving our operating efficiency to achieve operating cash flow break even in the current business environment and to better position our company for long term  profitable growth 
in january  we initiated a global reorganization and cost reduction plan designed to lower the company s cash breakeven level in order to enable us to sustain ourselves financially in the current market environment 
as part of the plan  we reduced our workforce by 
we also implemented certain non severance measures that we expect to result in future cost savings 
in addition  we are restructuring our operations through our global regionalization strategy by  for example  placing more decision making in regions close to our semiconductor customers to enhance customer relationships  strengthening our local design  application and service capabilities to improve customer responsiveness  changing our manufacturing structure for shorter cycle time and improved product delivery capabilities  and realigning our research and development efforts 
we believe the following information is important to understanding our business  our financial statements and the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations fiscal year 
fiscal years ended december   december  and december  had weeks each 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from product sales of wafer probe cards 
revenues from our customers are subject to fluctuations due to factors including  but not limited to  design cycles  technology adoption rates  competitive pressure to reduce prices  cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold and market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
historically  increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products  the introduction of new  more complex products and the penetration of new markets 
we expect that revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials  payroll and manufacturing related overhead 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes costs related to the start up of our new manufacturing facility  which was completed in early and costs of the expansion of our manufacturing facility which was completed in our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products  some of which are a sole source 
we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders 
tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues 
we expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions or write offs of inventory as cost of revenues 
we design  manufacture and sell a fully custom product into the semiconductor test market  which is subject to significant variability and demand fluctuations 
our wafer probe cards are complex products that are custom to a specific chip design and must be delivered on relatively short lead times as compared to our overall manufacturing process 
as our advanced wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
we record an adjustment to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolete and non saleable 
table of contents inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering and material costs 
almost all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development activities to improve and enhance existing technologies and to develop new technologies for current and new markets and for new applications 
in fiscal  our relative percentage of revenue expenditure on research and development increased as compared to our expenditures in our fiscal and fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in revenues for fiscal we expect our relative investment in research and development to retain at the higher relative percentage of revenues for the short term  including through our fiscal  due to our continued commitment to product improvement  and new product and technology development 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  provision for doubtful accounts  internal and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other sales  marketing  and administrative activities 
these expenses also include costs for enforcing our patent rights and regulatory compliance costs 
restructuring 
restructuring charges include expenses related to employee termination severance pay and benefits and property  equipment and facility impairment charges incurred as part of our global cost reduction plans 
impairment of long lived assets 
asset impairment charges include charges associated with the write down of assets that have no future expected benefit or assets for which circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting 
our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations reported in our financial statements and related disclosures 
we have identified the following accounting policies as being critical because they require our management to make particularly difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
our management has discussed the development  selection  application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 

table of contents delivery has occurred 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
revenues from product sales to our customers other than our distributor are recognized upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of sale 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of our customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as our customer s payment history 
in instances where final acceptance of our product  is specified by our customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
in multiple element arrangements  we determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we then allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting based on relative fair value of individual elements 
we offer product maintenance and repair arrangements to our customers 
amounts due from our customers under these arrangements are initially recorded as deferred revenues 
the fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period and related costs are recorded as incurred 
revenues from the licensing of our design and manufacturing technology  which have been insignificant to date  are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled 
warranty accrual we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record adjustments to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolescence or non saleable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
inventory write downs once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world 
in order to monitor potential credit losses  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a 
table of contents quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
we take into consideration any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  and our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  or if other circumstances arise  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  and additional allowances could be required  which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our estimates of income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
while management has considered taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in additional income tax expense in such period 
we have evaluated the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and based on the weight of the available evidence we have concluded that it is more likely than not we will be able to realize all of our us deferred tax assets 
we have also evaluated our foreign deferred tax assets related to certain net operating losses and have concluded that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be utilized and therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  by expiration of or lapses in the r d tax credit laws  by transfer pricing  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  by tax costs related to intercompany realignments  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  or accounting principles  including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof 
additionally  our current and deferred tax provision is based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed 
differences between our tax provision and tax return may occur and such adjustments are recorded when identified 

table of contents effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which is a change in accounting for income taxes 
fin contains a two step recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as a result of the implementation of fin  our tax assets and liabilities did not differ from the assets and liabilities before adoption  therefore  we did not record any adjustments as of the adoption date 
in addition  consistent with the provisions of fin  we reclassified million of income tax liabilities from current to non current liabilities because payment of cash was not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date and we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority would occur 
at the adoption date of december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefit of which million net of federal impact on state benefit of unrecognized tax benefits would impact our effective tax rate if recognized 
see note income taxes in the notes consolidated financial statements in this form k  for additional information 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities which might result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is judgmental in nature 
however  we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to those matters 
our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
we have concluded that it is still more likely than not that we will be able to realize all of our domestic deferred tax assets 
for the deferred tax assets resulting from foreign net operating losses we have concluded that it is more likely than not that this asset will not be utilized and therefore  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed 
differences between our tax provision and tax return may occur and such adjustments are recorded when identified 

table of contents stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  we measure compensation expense for all employee share based payment awards using a fair value based method  reduced by estimated award forfeitures  and record such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we consider our accounting policy for share based compensation to be critical as determining the fair value of awards involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of input assumptions  including the expected life  expected price volatility of the underlying stock  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  changes to the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value of our employee stock options 
sfas no 
r also requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based payment awards that we expect to vest 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including the type of award and historical experience  and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the most significant assumptions impacted by management s judgment are the expected volatility and the expected life of the options 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
expected volatility 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of traded options to purchase shares of our common stock 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock 
expected life 
the expected life also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  longer option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  employees are not required to wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  we are required to estimate the expected term of the option 
when establishing the expected life of a newly granted option  the company applies the simplified method approach as outlined in staff accounting bulleting no 
the simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant  or for each vesting tranche for awards with graded vesting 
the mid point between the vesting date and the expiration date is used as the expected term under this method 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
changes to the input assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our share based payment awards 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of revenues fiscal fiscal fiscal revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses operating loss income interest income  net other income expense  net loss income before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net loss income fiscal years ended december  and december  revenues fiscal fiscal decrease change in thousands revenues by market dram flash soc total revenues total revenues declined by  or million  in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to weak demand for our advanced wafer probe cards caused by the downturn in the semiconductor market 
for certain of our products we also experienced pricing pressure in light of the availability of competitive products  which also contributed to the decrease in revenues 
our revenues for fiscal were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
revenues for our products that address the dram segment decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to weak market conditions in which dram device pricing fell precipitously  to pricing pressure from our customers on certain of our dram products due to the competitive environment  and from increased competition 
given the price trend of dram devices in fiscal  our customers that manufacture dram devices took certain actions to curtail spending and conserve cash  including decisions to delay test capacity expansions and ramping of key devices 
revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers also decreased significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to sales decline of our nor flash wafer probe cards in light of the reduced product ordering pattern of one of our primary nor flash device customers  to 
table of contents pricing pressure from our customers on certain of our flash products due to the competitive environment  and from increased competition for full wafer contactor products in the nand flash market 
market conditions for flash memory devices weakened during fiscal and  as a consequence  our customers that manufacture flash memory devices took certain actions similar to our dram customers which 
in turn  impacted the demand for our products 
the weakness in nor flash can be attributed to certain key customers pushing their production ramp of nanometer into we also experienced market share reduction as a result of pricing pressure on certain flash memory products due to the competitive environment 
revenues from manufacturers of soc devices decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to delayed production ramp of a key customer s ongoing transition to advanced technology nodes in both chipset application and high performance flip chip microprocessors  which are used in personal computer  gaming and graphics applications 
this revenue decline was partly offset by growth in the wire bond soc market segment 
we have experienced continued pressure on revenues resulting from the global economic downturn and continued economic uncertainty  particularly as it relates to the lower demand for devices manufactured by our semiconductor customers 
we expect weak demand for our products that address the dram  flash and soc segments to persist  which will affect our revenues and profitability into fiscal if our customers continue to defer purchases of our products until general economic and semiconductor market conditions improve  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
given the nature of the global macroeconomic weakness  the current downturn in the semiconductor industry and its effects on demand for our products  we are unable to precisely forecast when or if revenues and profitability will return to previous levels 
revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth our revenues by geographic region for the periods indicated fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands japan north america taiwan south korea europe total revenues geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we send the customer invoices 
for example  certain south korean customers purchase through their north american subsidiaries and accordingly  revenues derived from sales to such customers are reflected in north america revenues 
the decrease in revenues across all geographic regions was due to generally to the semiconductor industry downturn  characterized by weak demand for semiconductor devices  delayed production ramps and weak device pricing environments 
gross profit fiscal fiscal in thousands gross profit gross margin 
table of contents gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels  product mix  selling prices  factory loading  and material costs 
for fiscal  gross margin declined compared to fiscal primarily due to the significant decline in revenue driving lower factory utilization  thereby increasing unit manufacturing costs  as well as inventory write downs and declines in average selling prices 
this decline was partially mitigated by lower personnel costs as a result of our fiscal global cost reduction plans 
excess custom inventories are not uncommon as our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs that must be delivered on relatively short lead times  and often requires us to acquire and start certain production activities prior to a firm customer commitment 
charge offs to inventories increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal due primarily to customer cancellations 
gross margin for fiscal includes stock based compensation expense of million  or of revenue compared to million  or of revenue for fiscal the decline  in absolute dollars  was primarily as a result of reductions in headcount as a result of our global cost reduction plans 
in future periods  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of those products 
additionally  near term gross margins will likely be adversely affected by lower levels of product revenues in comparison to the same periods in the prior fiscal year 
research and development fiscal fiscal in thousands research and development of revenues research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in product development related costs offset by a decrease in personnel costs 
during fiscal  expenses related to new technology and product development increased million  and depreciation and facilities and information technology allocations increased million due to investment in research and development facilities and development equipment 
in fiscal personnel costs decreased million due to the work force reductions as well as the temporary suspension of our company s key employee bonus and profit sharing plans 
stock based compensation included within research and development was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  with the decrease in absolute dollars being primarily due to reductions in headcount as a result of our global reorganization plans 
as a percent of revenues  research and development expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the declining revenue base 
our future operating results depend significantly on our ability to timely deliver reliable  cost effective products that meet our customers testing requirements and that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace 
to do this  we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development 
we are continuing our strategic investments in research and development  including the development of our next generation parallelism architecture and products  fine pitch memory and logic products  advanced microspring interconnect technology and new process technologies 
we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies 

table of contents selling  general and administrative fiscal fiscal in thousands selling  general and administrative of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in legal costs and allowance for doubtful accounts offset in part by a decrease in personnel costs 
during fiscal  outside legal services incurred for protecting our intellectual property portfolio  tax services and other expenses increased by approximately million  provision for doubtful debts increased by million primarily due to the heightened risk of collection from a customer  and personnel related costs decreased by approximately million primarily due to the work force reductions as well as the temporary suspension of our key employee bonus plan and profit sharing plan 
in addition  stock based compensation included within selling  general and administrative expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  the decrease being primarily due to reductions in headcount as a result of our global reorganization plans 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the declining revenue base 
restructuring fiscal fiscal in thousands restructuring charges of revenues in both the first and second quarters of fiscal  we implemented global cost reduction plans that included reducing our global workforce 
as part of the first quarter action  our workforce was reduced by and as part of the second quarter action  we reduced our workforce by 
the first quarter action also included facility consolidation charges related to vacating buildings in livermore  california 
both plans were implemented to restructure our company to better align with the market environment 
all expenses  including adjustments associated with our restructuring plans are included in restructuring in the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we paid million  representing substantially all of the employee related expenses for the cost reduction plans and million primarily related to a non cancellable contract 
the remaining employee related charges will be paid in the first half of fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets fiscal fiscal in thousands impairment of long lived assets of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to construction in progress assets in singapore based on our decision not to proceed with the construction of a new manufacturing facility at the proposed site in singapore 
the impaired 
table of contents construction in progress assets consisted primarily of building design costs as well as costs of temporary construction structures 
interest and other income expense  net fiscal fiscal in thousands interest income expense of revenues other income expense  net of revenues the decrease in interest income on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily a result of lower interest rates and lower average cash balances during fiscal as compared to fiscal seeking greater investment safety  we re allocated our investment securities from longer maturity  higher yield municipal securities to u

benefit from provision for income taxes fiscal fiscal in thousands benefit from provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective income tax rate was a benefit in fiscal year versus a provision of in fiscal the fiscal benefit was negatively impacted by tax charges for tax losses in singapore but was positively impacted by the reinstatement of the us federal research and development credit and the favorable resolution of issues related to our company s irs examination during the singapore losses are due to the initial phase of a worldwide structure implemented to align our worldwide affiliates with the geographic mix of our customers 
in  we initiated the first phase of our current plan to establish operations in singapore to provide operational and financial services to the region 
a significant element of the new structure involves the sharing of certain expenses related to the ongoing development of intangible property 
tax charges to implement the new structure negatively impacted the effective tax rate by approximately and percentage points in fiscal and  respectively 
these charges consisted primarily of payments associated with our intellectual property shared between singapore and the u 
s 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be in the mid range in fiscal and possibly a lower rate in future years depending on profitability and the taxing jurisdiction as we begin to realize operational and tax efficiencies resulting from this alignment plan and improvement of the current economic and semiconductor industry climate 
on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of was signed into law 
under this law  the research tax credit was retroactively extended through january  from december  this extension of the credit benefited our fourth quarter and full year effective tax 
table of contents rate by less than one percentage point 
the california budget bill assembly bill  enacted on september   resulted in two temporary changes to the california income tax 
first  the bill suspends the use of net operating loss carryovers for the fiscal and second  the bill limits the use of research tax credit carryovers to no more than of the tax liability before credits 
while these changes did not affect our effective tax rate  they may impact our tax provision depending on our profitability in fiscal years ended december  and december  revenues fiscal fiscal increase decrease change in thousands revenues by market dram flash soc total revenues revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal our revenues for fiscal were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices  which accounted for more than half of our revenue growth in fiscal the increase was driven by accelerated tooling cycles for probe cards as a result of our customers continued migration to nanometer nodes to reduce their cost of test and improve productivity  and by volume production ramps for gb devices 
additionally applications such as mobile ram and graphic ram contributed to our dram revenue growth 
the increase in dram revenues was offset by a seasonal weakness in the mobile dram business due to decreased demand for mobile and consumer applications 
in the fourth quarter  the increase in dram revenues was also offset in part due to early execution issues with our harmony architecture based dram products 
approximately of our dram revenues for fiscal were derived from nanometer and below technology products compared to for fiscal revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers increased mainly due to increased demand for our nor flash wafer probe cards by a significant customer whose high volume ramp resulted from the growing demand for consumer applications which utilize multi chip packages 
revenues generated from sales to flash memory device manufacturers also increased for our nand flash wafer probe cards 
consumer applications which utilize multi chip packages were a major driver for both categories of flash devices 
semiconductors that are integrated into multi chip packages often benefit from increased wafer level testing to validate device performance before packaging 

table of contents revenues from manufacturers of soc devices increased primarily due to the new technology node transition for area array flip chip microprocessor products and existing and key customers engagements for our truescale applications in the mobile communications  digital consumer  and automotive controller markets 
revenue by geographic region fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands north america europe japan south korea taiwan total revenues geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we send the customer invoices 
for example  certain south korean customers purchase through their north american subsidiaries and accordingly  revenues derived from sales to such customers are reflected in north america revenues 
the decrease in revenues in north america was due primarily to decreased sales related to product transitions combined with decreased customer demand resulting from new product delays 
the increase in the percentage of revenues in japan was primarily due to increased demand from one customer as a result of a major nanometer and gb tooling cycle 
the increase in percentage of revenues in asia pacific was primarily due to growth in our business with taiwan and south korean customers and strong demand related to nanometer and gb transitions 
revenues in europe were primarily flat year over year as a percent of total revenue 
gross profit fiscal fiscal in thousands gross profit gross margin the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to higher revenues combined with improved factory productivity  cost reductions and lower charges for inventory reserves which in turn improved gross margin percentage 
these improvements were partially offset by higher warranty expense associated with the introduction of a new product technology and in the fourth quarter  by lower production levels 
excess custom probe card inventory write downs decreased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal due to cycle time reductions  increase in yields and improvement in our order fulfillment process 
excess custom inventories are not uncommon for us as our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  which requires us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
gross margin for fiscal includes additional stock based compensation expense of million  or of revenue  compared to  million  or of revenue for fiscal  due to the adoption of fas r in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents research and development fiscal fiscal in thousands research and development of revenues research and development expenses increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in personnel  new technology  product development related costs and facility expansion 
personnel costs increased million due to increased headcount while expenses related to new technology and product development increased million 
facilities related costs and depreciation increased million due to new investment in r d equipment and facilities expansion at our livermore  california  facilities while stock based compensation remained fairly consistent for the same periods 
we continued the development of our next generation parallelism architecture and products  fine pitch memory and soc products  advanced microspring interconnect technology and new process technologies 
we also made incremental investments in new technologies and products as we focus on new market opportunities 
selling  general and administrative fiscal fiscal in thousands selling  general and administrative of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increases in expenses related to personnel costs  facilities expansion  outside legal and other professional fees and stock based compensation 
personnel costs increased million primarily due to increased headcount while facilities related costs and depreciation increased million for fiscal legal and other professional incurred for protecting our intellectual property portfolio  tax and accounting services  and other expenses increased million 
in addition  stock based compensation expense also increased million primarily due to increased headcount and the one time modification charge of million  incurred during the first quarter of fiscal resulting from the accelerated vesting of unvested stock options and restricted stock units in conjunction with the severance agreement of our company s former president 
interest and other income expense  net fiscal fiscal in thousands interest income expense of revenues other income expense  net the increase in interest income was due to larger cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances throughout fiscal compared to fiscal while yields remained relatively flat

table of contents provision for income taxes fiscal fiscal in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal provision was impacted by tax charges related to our plan to align the structure of our worldwide affiliates with the geographic mix of our customers 
to effect this alignment  we initiated the first phase of our current plan to establish operations in singapore to provide operational and financial services to the region 
a significant element of the new structure involves the sharing of certain expenses related to the ongoing development of intangible property 
tax charges to implement the new structure impacted the fiscal effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
these charges consisted primarily of royalty prepayments associated with the buy in for our transfer of intellectual property to singapore that will be taxed in the u 
s 
and the loss of certain us tax deductions related to research and development and certain other administration expenses 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be in the mid range in fiscal and  and possibly a lower rate in future years  as we begins to realize operational and tax efficiencies resulting from this alignment plan 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities working capital the decrease in working capital in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances caused by our company s use of cash for operating activities in fiscal  partially offset by cash provided by investing and financing activities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits held at major banks  money market funds and u 
s 
government securities that at the time of purchase had maturities of days or less 
marketable securities consist of u 
s 
government and agency securities and municipal bonds 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities include million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december  days sales outstanding from receivables  or dso  was days at december  compared with days at december  the increase in dso is primarily due to the increase in mix of customers with longer standard payment terms 
in addition  with the recent challenges in the semiconductor market  a few of our customers which are in cash preservation mode are extending payments past their due dates 
fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands cash used in provided by operating activities cash provided by used for investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by the operating loss of million incurred during the fiscal year ended december  non cash 
table of contents charges included in net loss consisted of million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  million in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  million in reserves for doubtful accounts and million of asset impairment charges 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities in the fiscal year ended december  of million consisted primarily of an increase in inventories and refundable income taxes and increase in an accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
cash flows from investing activities the cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal primarily relate to the proceeds from the sale and maturities of a portion of our investment portfolio consisting primarily of municipal bonds offset in part by the purchase of us government and agency securities 
in addition  cash was used for capital expenditures in support of new product technology  factory capability  and service center and information technology system upgrades 
we carefully monitor our investments to minimize risks and have not experienced other than temporary investment losses 
except for experiencing declining yields  our investment portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the recent economic turmoil in the credit markets 
cash flows from financing activities the cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal were primarily attributable to net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year ended december  were significantly lower than tax benefits for the fiscal year ended december  due to the decrease in stock option exercises 
our available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities declined in each quarter of fiscal given the uncertainty in the global economy and the downturn in the semiconductor industry coupled with the decrease in demand for our products  we are focusing on improving our operating efficiency to achieve operating cash flow break even 
our actions have included operational expense reduction initiatives  re timing or eliminating certain capital spending and research and development projects and re negotiating longer payment terms with our vendors 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we are also considering to establish manufacturing and technology partnerships  or to seek short and long term debt obligations  or to obtain new financing facilities which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
however  if we are unsuccessful in improving our operating efficiency  reducing our cash outlays or increasing our available cash through financing  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will further decline in the first quarter of fiscal the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  payments due in fiscal years after total in thousands operating leases inventory purchase obligations total the table above excludes our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million as of december  and are classified as deferred and other long term tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the settlement period for our income tax liabilities cannot be determined  however  it is not expected to be due within the next twelve months 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  we were not involved in any such off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification agreements we from time to time in the ordinary course of our business enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that include indemnification obligations 
under these contractual arrangements  we have agreed to defend  indemnify and or hold the third party harmless from and against certain liabilities 
these arrangements include indemnities in favor of our customers in the event that our wafer probe cards infringe a third party s intellectual property and our lessors in connection with facility for leasehold liabilities that we may cause 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers  and our bylaws contain indemnification obligations in favor of our directors  officers and agents 
these indemnity arrangements may limit the type of the claim  the total amount that we can be required to pay in connection with the indemnification obligation and the time within which an indemnification claim can be made 
the duration of the indemnification obligation may vary  and for most arrangements  survives the agreement term and is indefinite 
it is not possible to determine or reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification obligations due to the varying terms of such obligations  the history of prior indemnification claims  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular contractual arrangement and in each potential future claim for indemnification  and the contingency of any potential liabilities upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable 
we have not had any requests for indemnification under these arrangements 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification arrangements on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  we believe that substantially all of our indemnities and commitments provide for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
however  we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of liability related to our indemnities and commitments because such liabilities are contingent upon the occurrence of events which are not reasonably determinable 
management believes that any liability for these indemnities and commitments would not be material to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements please refer to the discussion of our recent accounting pronouncements in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item in this form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct certain operations in foreign currencies 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion  but not all  of existing foreign currency denominated amounts 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on the currency forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company recognized net gain of million for the fiscal year ended december   from the fluctuation in 
table of contents foreign exchange rates and the valuation of these hedge contracts in our financial statements under other expense 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in a number of securities including us agency discount notes  municipal bonds and notes and money market funds 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high grade investment securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to an issuer  except us treasuries and us agencies 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposures nor do we invest for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
if overall interest rates had fallen by in fiscal  our reported interest income would have declined approximately million  assuming consistent investment levels
