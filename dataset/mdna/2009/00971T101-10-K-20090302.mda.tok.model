item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the internet 
we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
in recent years  however  we have entered into increasing numbers of customer contracts that have minimum usage commitments that are based on quarterly  twelve month or longer periods 
our goal of having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly or annual recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functions that our existing customers purchase 
at the same time  we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than  or at the same rate as  our revenues 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of quality  price and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or md a  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  or divestitures of business combinations that may be announced after the date hereof

table of contents we were profitable for fiscal years  and  however  we cannot guarantee continued profitability or profitability at the levels we have recently experienced for any period in the future 
we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future during each quarter of  the dollar volume of new recurring revenue contracts that we booked exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations  terminations and non payment 
a continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenues 
during each quarter of  unit prices offered to some new and existing customers declined  including contracts signed with certain customers at higher committed service levels that reflected volume discounts 
additionally  increased competition from new entrants into the market that are willing to use low unit prices as a method of differentiation contributed to these price declines 
if we continue to experience decreases in unit prices for new and existing customers  our operating profit percentage could decrease 
during each quarter of  we reduced our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions offered by our existing suppliers 
additionally  we continue to invest in internal use software development to improve the performance and efficiency of our network 
due to increased traffic delivered over our network  however  our total bandwidth costs increased during these quarters 
we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels  but we anticipate continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
if we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing or we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers  total network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in during each quarter of  no customer accounted for or more of our total revenues 
we expect that customer concentration levels will continue to decline compared to those in prior years if our customer base continues to grow 
during the year ended december   revenues derived from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues 
we expect revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues to be between and in as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to record compensation expense for employee stock awards at fair value at the time of grant 
for the years ended december   and  our stock based compensation expense was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect that stock based compensation expense will continue at the current level  because we have a significant number of unvested employee awards outstanding that we expect will be offset by grants of stock based compensation awards in the future at lower fair values than those previously granted 
as of december   our total unrecognized compensation costs for stock based awards were million  which we expect to recognize as expense over a weighted average period of years 
this expense is expected to be recognized through depreciation and amortization expense related to our network equipment and internal use software development costs increased by million during as compared to due to expected future purchases of network equipment during  we believe that depreciation expense related to our network equipment will continue to increase in we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings and capitalize stock based compensation expense attributable to employees working on such projects  which would increase the amount of capitalized internal use software costs 
as a result  we believe that the amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenues  will increase in as compared to 
table of contents as of december   we have recorded a pre tax cumulative unrealized loss in stockholders equity of million related to the temporary impairment of our marketable security investments and million of realized loss in our statement of operations related to the other than temporary impairment of our investments in auction rate securities  or ars 
we also recorded a realized gain of million related to an agreement we entered into with one of our investment advisors 
under the terms of the agreement  the investment advisor agreed to repurchase  in june  the ars it previously sold to us 
the gain represented by the put option incorporated into this agreement was included in gain loss on investments  net in our statement of operations 
based upon our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of million and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business during we believe we have the ability to hold these ars until a recovery of the auction process  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer  or until maturity 
during the year ended december   our effective income tax rate was 
while we expect our annual effective income tax rate to remain relatively consistent during  we do not expect to make significant cash tax payments due to the continued utilization of our deferred tax assets 
in november  we announced a workforce reduction affecting employees across all functional areas 
we recorded million as a restructuring charge for the amount of one time benefits provided to affected employees 
included in these costs is a net reduction in non cash stock based compensation of million  reflecting a modification to certain stock based awards previously granted to affected employees 
additionally  in december  in connection with excess and vacated facilities under long term non cancelable leases  we recorded million as a restructuring charge for the estimated future lease payments  less estimated sublease income  for these vacated facilities 
we expect that million of these liabilities will be paid in based on our analysis of  among other things  the aforementioned trends and events  as of the date of this annual report on form k  we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly and annual basis during  however  our future results are likely to be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers through long term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  offset unit price declines for our services with higher volumes of traffic delivered on our network as well as increased sales of our value added solutions  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including generating positive net income  in any future period 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related reserves  valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities  capitalized internal use software costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  tax reserves  impairment 
table of contents and useful lives of long lived assets  loss contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to assess a range of potential outcomes 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize service revenue in accordance with the commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we primarily derive revenues from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly  quarterly or annual level of usage and specify the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly  quarterly or annual minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge customers an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive income from services sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue when the event or usage has occurred 
when more than one element is contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period commencing when all services have begun to be provided 
for most multi element service arrangements we have entered into to date  the fair value of each element has not been objectively determinable 
therefore  all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period commencing when we have begun to provide all services ordered 

table of contents at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an estimate as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on a combination of factors  including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review  our collection experience with the customer and other forms of payment assurance 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 
we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract  plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless the product or service received has a separate and identifiable benefit and the fair value to us of the vendor s product or service can be objectively established 
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
we record revenue for these transactions on a gross basis when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  prepayments made by customers for future periods  deferred installation and activation set up fees  and amounts billed under customer arrangements with extended payment terms 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
in addition to trade accounts receivable  our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month 
we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts and revenue from certain customers on a cash basis 
increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
increases in the reserve for cash basis customers are recorded as reduction of revenue 
the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers for which collection is no longer assured 
the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer specific  account by account basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a cash basis reserve until we receive consistent payments 

table of contents valuation and impairment of investments and marketable securities effective january   we implemented sfas no 
 fair value measurement  or sfas no 
 for our financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period  and non financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at least annually 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
we have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value principally cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities that have been classified as level  or within the fair value hierarchy as described in sfas no 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
included in our short and long term marketable securities at december  and are ars that are primarily aaa rated bonds  most of which are collateralized by federally guaranteed student loans 
ars are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates that may reset through a dutch auction process that is designed to occur every seven to days 
historically  the carrying value par value of ars approximated fair market value due to the resetting of variable interest rates 
beginning in mid february and continuing throughout the period ended december   however  the auctions for ars then held by us were unsuccessful 
as a result  the interest rates on ars reset to the maximum rate per the applicable investment offering statements 
we will not be able to liquidate affected ars until a future auction on these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside the auction process  the securities are called or refinanced by the issuer  or the securities mature 
due to the long term nature of the underlying student loan bonds and the failure of the auction process to provide a current market  we classified these investments as long term on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in light of these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments 
the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions  the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates  collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december  assumes a weighted average discount rate of and expected term of five years 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaa rated ars market 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
as a result  as of december   we have estimated an aggregate loss of million  of which million was related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity and of which million was related to the 
table of contents impairment of ars deemed other than temporary and included in gain loss on investments  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
despite the failed auctions  we continue to receive cash flows in the form of specified interest payments from the issuers of ars 
in addition  except for ars with respect to which we have entered into an agreement allowing us to sell such ars in june  we have the intent and ability to hold our ars until a recovery of the impairment because we believe we have sufficient cash and other marketable securities on hand and from projected cash flows from operations such that we do not anticipate a need to sell our ars prior to a recovery to par value 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if this comparison indicates that impairment is present  the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets  the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairments on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of december  and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of december  and we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of december  and december  these tests did not result in an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of completed technologies  customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements arising from acquisitions of businesses and acquired license rights 
purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value derived from the related intangible assets 
goodwill is carried at its historical cost 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability 
material loss contingencies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
tax reserves our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 

table of contents we currently have significant deferred tax assets  comprised of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
our management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as of the date of adoption  we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  including accrued interest and penalties  and did not record any cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting fin as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  including accrued interest and penalties 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to determine fair value of stock option awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
our assumptions may differ from those used in prior periods because of adjustments to the calculation of such assumptions based upon the guidance of sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
should our actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
for stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and deferred stock units  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards vesting periods for those awards that contain only a service vesting feature 
for awards with a performance condition vesting feature  we recognize compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the awards expected vesting periods 
capitalized internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal use software projects 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization 
once the project is complete  we estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 

table of contents results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increases in revenue during the years presented were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts  as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers 
increased sales to existing customers contributed to increases in the average revenue per customer during each year  partially offset by reduced unit prices offered to new and renewing customers 
we believe that the continued growth in use of the internet by businesses and consumers was the principal factor driving increased purchases of our services 
we expect this trend to continue in but at lower rates of growth due to general economic conditions and a leveling off of the rate of increased growth in use of the internet 
also contributing to the increase in revenues for the years ended december  and were revenues generated through our acquisitions of acerno  which added million of revenue during the fourth quarter of  netli  nine systems and red swoosh 
as of december   we had  customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to  at december  and  at december  for and  and  respectively  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which and of total revenues  respectively  was derived from operations in europe 
for  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which of total revenues was derived from operations in europe 
other than the united states  no single country accounted for or more of our total revenues during these periods 
we expect international sales to increase slightly as a percentage of our total sales in as compared to prior years 
resellers accounted for of revenues in  in and in for  and  no single customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and stock based compensation expense for network operations personnel  cost of software licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software 
cost of revenues was comprised of the following in millions for the years ended december  bandwidth  co location and storage fees payroll and related costs of network operations personnel stock based compensation depreciation and impairment of network equipment amortization of internal use software total cost of revenues cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  these increases were primarily due to an increase in the amounts paid to network providers due to higher traffic levels  partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit  and increases in depreciation expense of network equipment and amortization of internal use software as we continued to invest in our infrastructure 
additionally  in  and  cost of revenues included stock based compensation expense  such expense decreased by million in as compared to and increased by million in as compared to cost of revenues during  and also included credits received of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing disputes related to bandwidth contracts 
credits of this nature may occur in the future  however  the timing and amount of future credits  if any  will vary 

table of contents we have long term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co location with various networks and internet service providers 
for the years ending december  and  the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co location services are approximately million and million  respectively 
we believe cost of revenues will increase in we expect to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic  however  such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit 
additionally  for  we anticipate increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal use software development costs  along with increased payroll and related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network with the expectation that our customer base will continue to expand 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and stock based compensation expense for research and development personnel who design  develop  test  deploy and enhance our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except for certain internal use software development costs eligible for capitalization 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  net of impairments 
these development costs consisted of external consulting  payroll and payroll related costs for personnel involved in the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
additionally  for the years ended december   and  we capitalized as internal use software million  million and million  respectively  of non cash stock based compensation 
these capitalized internal use software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 
research and development expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the research and development expense decrease in as compared to was due to decreases in stock based compensation expense and travel costs as well as an increase in amount of costs capitalized as internal use software  partially offset by an increase in payroll and related costs resulting from higher headcount 
the research and development expense increase in as compared to the prior year was due to increases in payroll and related costs resulting from higher headcount  as well as additional stock based compensation expense 
the following table quantifies the net changes in the various components of our research and development expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation capitalized salaries and other total net decrease increase we believe that research and development expenses will increase in because we expect to continue to hire additional development personnel in order to make improvements in our core technology  develop new services and make refinements to our other service offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expense and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and support functions  as well as advertising and promotional expenses 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs  particularly commissions for sales and marketing personnel  attributable to revenue growth and as a result of higher marketing related costs  particularly for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the following table quantifies the net increase in the various components of our sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in sales and marketing expenses to to payroll and related costs stock based compensation marketing and related costs other expense total net increase we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales of our services  offset by a reduction in payroll and related costs due to a decrease in our sales and marketing personnel and other marketing costs such as advertising 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components payroll  stock based compensation expense and other related costs  including expenses for executive  finance  business applications  network management  human resources and other administrative personnel  depreciation of property and equipment we use internally  fees for professional services  rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties  the provision for doubtful accounts  insurance costs  and non income related taxes 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses during both periods was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth 
additionally  facilities related costs increased due to office expansions  and we incurred increased expenditures for professional services  particularly legal and consulting fees 
this increase was offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense during in comparison to

amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights 
amortization of other intangible assets increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december  increased by million  or  over amortization of other intangible assets in the year ended december  of million 
the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in as compared to was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions of acerno in november and a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the red swoosh acquisition in april the increase in amortization of intangible assets in as compared to was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of netli in march and a full year of amortization of intangible assets from the nine systems acquisition in december based on our currently owned intangible assets  we expect amortization of other intangible assets to be approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december     and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities 
interest income decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in the interest rates  offsetting higher cash and marketable securities balances driven by an increase in our cash from operations 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in our total invested marketable securities as a result of an increase in our cash from operations 
interest expense 
interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year 
table of contents ended december  interest expense during these periods was primarily attributable to interest payable on the outstanding amount of our convertible senior notes 
based upon our outstanding indebtedness at december   we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations  including deferred financing amortization  will not exceed million in other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily represents net foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented as well as gains on legal settlements 
other income  net decreased  or  to other income  net of million for the year ended december  as compared to other income  net of million for the year ended december  other income  net was million for the year ended december  other income  net for the year ended december  consisted of million of foreign exchange gains and  of net gains on legal settlements 
other income  net of million for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  of foreign exchange gains and million of net gains on legal settlements 
for the year ended december   other income  net of million consisted of approximately  of foreign exchange losses  offset by million of net gains on legal settlements 
other income expense  net may fluctuate in the future based upon movements in foreign exchange rates  the outcome of legal proceedings and other events 
gain loss on investments  net 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net loss on investments of million  which reflects a loss of million due to other than temporary impairments on marketable securities  a gain of million realized on a put option received from one of our investment advisors in november  and a gain of million on the sale of marketable securities 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded a net gain on investments of  and million  respectively  from the sale of marketable securities 
we do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during  we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of  as a result of conversions to common stock of million in principal amount of our convertible notes in august and  in principal amount of such notes in january we did not record any loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the or provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate of was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate applicable to corporations due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation  partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 
for the years ended december  and december   our effective tax rates of and respectively  were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to state income taxes and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation  partially offset by the benefit recorded for research and development tax credits 
provision for income taxes increased by  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  provision for income taxes increased by  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  these increases were primarily due to increases in our operating income 
while we expect our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in to remain relatively consistent with  this expectation does not take into consideration the effect of discrete items recorded as a result of our compliance with sfas no 
r or any potential tax planning strategies 
our effective tax rate could be materially different depending on the nature and timing of the disposition of incentive and other employee stock options 
further  our effective tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year and from quarter to quarter  due to items arising from discrete events  including settlements of tax audits and assessments  the resolution or identification of tax position uncertainties and acquisitions of other companies 

table of contents because of the availability of nols  a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a non cash expense  consequently  the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  annualized effective tax rates  and cash paid for income taxes  management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate tax liability or benefit from of these matters may be materially greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions private sales of capital stock and subordinated notes  which notes were repaid in  an initial public offering of our common stock in october  which generated net proceeds of million  the sale in june of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  which generated net proceeds of million and were repaid or redeemed in full between december and september  the sale in december and january of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which generated net proceeds of million  the public offering of million shares of our common stock in november  which generated net proceeds of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock awards  and cash generated by operations 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which consisted of corporate debt securities  us treasury and government agency securities  commercial paper  corporate debt securities and student loan backed ars  totaled million 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 
we held approximately million and million in par value of ars at december  and  respectively 
the ars are primarily aaa rated bonds  most of which are guaranteed by the us government as part of the federal family education loan program through the us department of education 
none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed or collateralized debt obligations 
in mid february  all of our ars experienced failed auctions  which failures continued throughout the rest of as a result  we have been unable to liquidate most of our holdings of ars 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments to have a material impact on our financial 
table of contents condition or results of operations in in november  we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors that provides for the repurchase in june of million of the ars we hold if we have been unable to achieve liquidity with respect to such securities before that time 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an expected increase in cash collections related to higher revenues  partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries and higher commissions 
current economic conditions could negatively impact our cash provided by operating activities if we are unable to manage our days sales outstanding or our business otherwise deteriorates

table of contents changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as deferred revenue  accounts payable  accounts receivable and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure  including debt repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events

in january  the line of credit for million was approved by the investment advisor 
we have not yet used the line of credit 
we believe  based on our present business plan  that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
we may not  however  be able to sell equity or debt securities on terms we consider reasonable or at all 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders

 as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  which included approximately million of accrued interest and penalties 
we do not expect to recognize any of these tax benefits in we are not  however  able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
letters of credit as of december   we had outstanding million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third party beneficiaries  primarily related to facility leases 
approximately million of these letters of credit are collateralized by restricted marketable securities  of which million are classified as short term marketable securities and million are classified as long term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet at december  the restrictions on these marketable securities lapse as we fulfill our obligations or as such obligations expire under the terms of the letters of credit 
these restrictions are expected to lapse at various times through may the remaining million of irrevocable letters of credit are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect until december off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various indemnification arrangements with third parties  including vendors  customers  landlords  our officers and directors  shareholders of acquired companies  joint venture partners and third party licensees of our technology 
generally  these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by third parties due to various events  such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any significant liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion of these indemnification agreements 
the conversion features of our convertible senior notes due december  are equity linked derivatives 
as such  we recognize these instruments as off balance sheet arrangements 
the conversion features associated with these notes would be accounted for as derivative instruments  except that they are indexed to our common stock and classified in stockholders equity

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio 
in our investment portfolio  we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit 
our investment policy also limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times and maximizing returns subject to our investment policy 
at december   we held million in par value of ars that have experienced failed auctions  which has prevented us from liquidating those investments 
as a result  we have classified these investments as long term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  due to these liquidity issues  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of these ars investments 
the discounted cash flow analysis we performed considered the timing of expected future successful auctions  the impact of extended periods of maximum interest rates  collateralization of underlying security investments and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
the discounted cash flow analysis performed as of december  assumes a weighted average discount rate of and expected term of five years 
the discount rate was determined using a proxy based upon the current market rates for similar debt offerings within the aaa rated ars market 
the expected term was based on management s estimate of future liquidity 
as a result  as of december   we have estimated an aggregate loss of million  of which million was related to the impairment of ars deemed to be temporary and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity and of which million was related to the impairment of ars deemed other than temporary and included in gain loss on investments  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
based on our ability to access our cash and short term investments and our expected cash flows  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these ars will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations during or our ability to operate our business in our valuation of the ars is sensitive to market conditions and management s judgment and could change significantly based on the assumptions used 
if we had used a term of three years or seven years and discount rate of  the gross unrealized loss on the million in par value of ars classified as available for sale would have been million or million  respectively 
if we had used a term of five years and discount rate of or  the gross unrealized loss on the million in par value of ars classified as available for sale would have been million or million  respectively 
during november  we entered into an agreement with one of our investment advisors providing for it to repurchase the ars held through such advisor at par value beginning on june  the ars covered by this agreement had a par value of million at december  we expect to continue to hold these long term debt instruments until the earlier of the settlement date or the date on which the market for active trading of ars at par value is re established 
at any time during the period up until the june  our investment advisor can call the ars at par value 
we elected to apply the fair value option under sfas no 
to the put option incorporated in this repurchase agreement 
the million fair value of such put option is grouped with other long term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet with the resultant gain offsetting million of the related ars impairment included in other income  net 
the fair value of the put option is determined by comparing the fair value of the related ars  as described above  to their par values and also considers the credit risk associated with our investment advisor 
this put option will be adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value 
the valuation of our million in par value of ars subject to the put option is also sensitive to market conditions and management s judgment and could change significantly based on assumptions used  resulting in a change in the realized loss on investments recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
any change in the realized loss on the ars would  however  be offset by a corresponding change in the realized gain on the valuation of the put option related to these ars recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
any net gain loss from future changes in market conditions is not expected to be material because the changes in valuations of the ars and related put option will generally offset each other 

table of contents our convertible senior notes are subject to changes in market value 
under certain conditions  the holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to redeem the notes on or after december  as of december   the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of the convertible senior notes were million and million  respectively 
we have operations in europe  asia  australia and india 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
additionally  we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations  which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
we do not have any foreign currency hedge contracts
