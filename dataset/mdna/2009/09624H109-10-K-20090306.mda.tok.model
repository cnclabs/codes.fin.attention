overview company background bluelinx is a leading distributor of building products in the united states 
as of january   we distributed more than  products to approximately  customers through our network of more than warehouses and third party operated warehouses which serve all major metropolitan markets in the united states 
we distribute products in two principal categories structural products and specialty products 
structural products include plywood  osb  rebar and remesh  lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support  walls and flooring in construction projects 
structural products represented approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 
specialty products include roofing  insulation  moulding  engineered wood  vinyl products used primarily in siding and metal products excluding rebar and remesh 
specialty products accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 

table of contents a number of factors cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
many of these factors are seasonal or cyclical in nature 
conditions in the united states housing market are at historically low levels and continued to deteriorate throughout fiscal our operating results have declined during the past two years as they are closely tied to us housing starts 
additionally  the mortgage markets have experienced substantial disruption due to a rising number of defaults in the subprime market 
this disruption and the related defaults have increased the inventory of homes for sale and also have caused lenders to tighten mortgage qualification criteria which further reduces demand for new homes 
forecasters continue to have a bearish outlook for the housing market and we expect the downturn in new housing activity will continue to negatively impact our operating results for the foreseeable future 
we continue to prudently manage our inventories  receivables and spending in this environment 
however  along with many forecasters  we believe us housing demand will improve in the long term based on population demographics and a variety of other factors 
selected factors that affect our operating results our operating results are affected by housing starts  mobile home production  industrial production  repair and remodeling spending and non residential construction 
we believe a substantial percentage of our sales are directly related to new home construction 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in product prices 
structural products prices can vary significantly based on short term and long term changes in supply and demand 
the prices of specialty products also can vary from time to time  although they generally are significantly less variable than structural products

gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars compared to fiscal was primarily driven by a decrease in specialty and structural product volumes due to the continued decline in the housing market and a lower of cost or market reserve charge of million during fiscal related to a decline in prices for our structural metal inventory 
the increase in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to an increase in certain structural metal prices earlier in the year and a shift in product mix from structural to higher margin specialty products 
additionally  we estimate that the stock keeping unit sku rationalization program negatively impacted gross margin by approximately basis points in fiscal structural gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal specialty gross margin increased to in fiscal from a year ago 
selling  general and administrative expenses

table of contents market 
the increase in gross margin percentage of is primarily attributable to a shift toward the warehouse channel  which typically provides higher gross margins  and a slight shift in product mix from structural to higher margin specialty products  offset in part by a decline in underlying product prices compared to the prior year as well as our sku rationalization initiative during the fourth quarter of we estimate that the sku rationalization program negatively impacted gross margin by approximately basis points in fiscal during fiscal  we remained focused on maintaining gross margin through our ongoing management of structural product pricing

seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the building products distribution industry 
the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market 
our second and third quarters are typically our strongest quarters  reflecting a substantial increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions 
our working capital and accounts receivable and payable generally peak in the third quarter  while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the summer building season 
although  we generally expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future  we have reduced our inventory as part of our effort to manage to the current weakened demand environment in the housing market 
additionally  our accounts receivable balance has declined due to the weakened demand environment for the products we distribute 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures  dividends and acquisitions 
we believe that the amounts available 
table of contents from this and other sources will be sufficient to fund our routine operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the credit markets have recently experienced adverse conditions  which may adversely affect our lenders ability to fulfill their commitment under our revolving credit facility 
based on information available to us as of the filing date of this form k  we have no indications that the financial institutions included in our revolving credit facility would be unable to fulfill their commitments 
part of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions 
accordingly  depending on the nature of the acquisition or currency  we may use cash or stock  or a combination of both  as acquisition currency 
our cash requirements may significantly increase and incremental cash expenditures will be required in connection with the integration of the acquired company s business and to pay fees and expenses in connection with any acquisitions 
to the extent that significant amounts of cash are expended in connection with acquisitions  our liquidity position may be adversely impacted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing acquisitions in the future or in implementing our acquisition strategy 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy  see the risk factor integrating acquisitions may be time consuming and create costs that could reduce our net income and cash flows set forth under item a risk factors 
the following tables indicate our working capital and cash flows for the periods indicated 
january  december  dollars in thousands working capital year ended year ended year ended january  december  december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities working capital working capital decreased by million  primarily as a result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  and an increase in current maturities of long term debt of million 
these changes were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of million 
the remaining decreases were related to reductions in other receivables and cash collateral 
additionally  cash increased from million at december  to million at january   primarily due to reductions in working capital 
the million of cash on our balance sheet at january  primarily reflects cash generated due to reductions in working capital and customer remittances received in our lock boxes on friday and saturday that are not available until the next monday  which is part of the following period 
operating activities during fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million 
the primary driver of cash flow from operations was an increase in cash flow from operations related to working capital of million reflecting decreases in accounts receivable and a reduction in inventory partially offset by a contribution to the hourly pension plan of million  and a net loss  as adjusted for non cash charges  of million

the primary drivers of cash flow from operations were net income  as adjusted for non cash charges  of million and an increase in cash flow from operations related to working capital of million reflecting decreases in accounts receivable and a reduction in structural product inventory  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and a slight increase in specialty products inventory 
investing activities during fiscal and fiscal  cash flows provided by used in investing activities totaled million and million  respectively 
during fiscal and fiscal  our expenditures for property and equipment were million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were used primarily to purchase mobile equipment consisting of trucks  trailers  forklifts and sales force automobiles 
we estimate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million for normal operating activities 
our capital expenditures are anticipated to be paid from our current cash 
proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment totaled million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the proceeds of million during fiscal included million of proceeds related to the sale of certain real properties 
for fiscal  the proceeds of million included million from an insurance settlement related to property damage from hurricane katrina 
during fiscal  cash flows used for investing activities totaled million 
the primary driver of cash flows from investing activities in fiscal was acquisition related expenditures and expenditures for property and equipment of million and million  respectively 
the expenditures for property and equipment were primarily for mobile equipment 
proceeds from the disposition of property totaled million in fiscal financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal and million during fiscal the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal primarily reflected a net decrease in our revolving credit facility of million  a decrease in bank overdrafts of million  principal payments on our mortgage of million  and prepayment fees associated with principal payments on our mortgage of million 
the net cash used in financing activities in fiscal primarily reflected a net decrease in our revolving credit facility of million  decrease in bank overdrafts of million  and common dividend payments of million 
there were no common dividend payments during fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  which primarily resulted from the retirement of the old mortgage of million  a net decrease in the revolving credit facility of million  common dividends payments of million  and a decrease in bank overdrafts of million 
these decreases were offset by proceeds from the new mortgage of million 
debt and credit sources as of january   advances outstanding under our revolving credit facility were approximately million 
borrowing availability was approximately million and outstanding letters of credit on this facility were approximately million 
as of january   the interest rate on outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility was 
on june   certain special purpose entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries of ours entered into a million mortgage loan with the german american capital corporation 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced the principal amount of the mortgage loan by million 
the mortgage has a term of ten years and is now secured by distribution facilities and office building owned by the special purpose entities 
the stated interest rate on the mortgage is fixed at 
the mortgage loan requires interest only payments for the first five years followed by level monthly payments of principal and interest based on an 
table of contents amortization period of thirty years 
the balance of the loan outstanding at the end of ten years will then become due and payable 
german american capital corporation assigned half of its interest in the new mortgage loan to wachovia bank  national association 
this mortgage replaced our previously existing million floating rate mortgage  which had a interest rate when it was terminated  with a fixed rate mortgage loan 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold certain real properties that ceased operations and were closed during the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the sale of one of these properties  we reduced our mortgage loan by million and incurred a mortgage prepayment penalty of million 
the sale of these properties resulted in a recognized gain of million  a note receivable of million recorded in other non current assets and a deferred gain of million recorded in other non current liabilities 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with goldman sachs capital markets  to hedge against interest rate risks related to our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and the terms call for us to receive interest monthly at a variable rate equal to the day libor and to pay interest monthly at a fixed rate of 
this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge 
through january   the hedge was highly effective in offsetting changes in expected cash flows as the critical terms of the interest rate swap generally match the critical terms of the variable rate revolving credit facility 
fluctuations in the fair value of the ineffective portion  if any  of the cash flow hedge are reflected in current period earnings 
these amounts were immaterial during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal at january  and december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million and million  respectively 
these balances were included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
at january   we had approximately million of cash collateral held related to the interest rate swap liability 
accumulated other comprehensive loss income at january  and december  included the net loss on the cash flow hedge net of tax of million and million  respectively  which reflects the cumulative amount of comprehensive loss recognized in connection with the change in fair value of the swap 
during january  we reduced our borrowings under the revolving credit facility by million at which point the hedge became ineffective in offsetting changes in expected cash flows during the remaining term of the interest rate swap 
we used cash on hand to pay down this portion of our revolving credit debt 
the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million recorded in interest expense at the payment date 
the remaining million of other comprehensive loss will be amortized over the remaining month term of the interest rate swap and recorded as interest expense 
approximately million will be amortized over the next months and recorded as interest expense 
all future changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap during the remaining term of the interest rate swap will be recorded as interest expense 
any further reductions in borrowings under our revolving credit facility will result in a pro rata reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the payment date with a corresponding charge recorded to interest expense

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
as with all judgments  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  current economic trends in the industry  information provided by customers  vendors and other outside sources and management s estimates  as appropriate 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated as fob free on board 
table of contents shipping point 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
all product sales are recorded at gross in accordance with the guidance outlined by emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf and in accordance with standard industry practice 
the key indicators used to determine this are as follows we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfillment  we hold title to all reload inventory and are responsible for all product returns  we control the selling price for all channels  we select the supplier  and we bear all credit risk 
we also provide delivery and product management services for which the associated revenues are recognized upon completion of services 
these revenues represent less than of our net sales 
all revenues recognized are net of trade allowances  cash discounts and sales returns 
cash discounts and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations and historical experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for each aging category on our aged trial balance based on our historical loss experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of specific customers inability to meet their financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or other evidence of liquidity problems 
as we determine that specific balances will be ultimately uncollectible  we remove them from our aged trial balance 
additionally  we maintain reserves for cash discounts that we expect customers to earn as well as expected returns 
at january  and december   these reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and uncollectible accounts have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal inventory valuation inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that first quality  actively moving inventory  when viewed by category  is carried at the lower of cost or market 
at january  and december   the lower of cost or market reserve totaled million and million  respectively 
additionally  we maintain a reserve for the estimated value impairment associated with damaged  excess and obsolete inventory 
the damaged  excess and obsolete reserve generally includes inventory that has turn days in excess of days  excluding new items during their product launch  or discontinued items 
at january  and december   our damaged  excess and obsolete inventory reserves totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to damaged  excess and obsolete estimates have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  shared based payment sfas r  we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value for all share based payment awards that are expected to vest 
this expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award  unless the awards are subject to market or performance conditions  in which case we recognize 
table of contents compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche 
all compensation expense related to our share based payment awards is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
compensation expense arising from stock based awards granted to employees and non employee directors is recognized as expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
as of january   there was million  million  million and million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares  respectively 
the unrecognized compensation expense for stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares is expected to be recognized over a period of years  years  years and years  respectively 
as of december  there was million  million million and million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares  respectively 
the unrecognized compensation expense for stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares was expected to be recognized over a period of years  years  years and years  respectively 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  our total stock based compensation expense was million  million  and million  respectively 
we also recognized related income tax benefits of million  million and million  respectively 
consideration received from vendors and paid to customers each year  we enter into agreements with many of our vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates  generally based on achievement of specified volume purchasing levels and various marketing allowances that are common industry practice 
we accrue for the receipt of vendor rebates based on purchases  and also reduce inventory value to reflect the net acquisition cost purchase price less expected purchase rebates 
at january  and december   the vendor rebate receivable totaled million and million  respectively 
in addition  we enter into agreements with many of our customers to offer customer rebates  generally based on achievement of specified volume sales levels and various marketing allowances that are common industry practice 
we accrue for the payment of customer rebates based on sales to the customer  and also reduce sales value to reflect the net sales sales price less expected customer rebates 
at january  and december   the customer rebate payable totaled million and million  respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to rebate estimates have been insignificant for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal impairment of long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
our fair value estimate for fixed assets and intangible long lived assets are considered to be level measurements in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets to fair value 
these costs were included in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of 
table of contents operations 
there were no adjustments to earnings resulting from the impairment of long lived assets for fiscal and fiscal income taxes deferred income tax assets and income tax benefits are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
if  for some reason  the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of temporary differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
sfas requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  our ability to carryback losses against prior taxable income  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  tax planning strategies  our forecast of future taxable income and the existence of an excess of appreciated assets over the tax basis of our net assets in amounts sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating and non operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
during fiscal  we recorded a million valuation allowance primarily related to state deferred tax assets  of which million reduced the benefit from income taxes 
we have recorded deferred income tax assets of million and million at january  and december   reflecting the benefit of million and million of deductible temporary differences  respectively 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future years 
in fiscal  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return including a discussion of whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
the cumulative effect of applying fin is reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
adoption of fin on december  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
restructuring charges during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million and million related to certain cost reduction initiatives 
in connection with those cost reduction initiatives  we vacated leased office space and certain distribution facilities 
we accounted for these transactions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at fair value in the period in which it is incurred or when the entity ceases using the right conveyed by a contract ie  the right to use a leased property 
our restructuring charges included accruals for estimated losses on facility costs based on our contractual obligations net of estimated sublease income based on current comparable market rates for leases 
we will reassess this liability periodically based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either do not materialize or change 
at january  and december   the vacant property reserve totaled and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded approximately million of expense related to a change in estimate associated with one of our exited facilities 
these costs were included in selling  general and administrative expense in the 
table of contents consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities  and in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at january  and december  self insurance it is our policy to self insure  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
our self insured deductible for each claim involving workers compensation  comprehensive general liability including product liability claims  and auto liability is limited to million  million  and million  respectively 
we are also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property million per occurrence and the majority of our medical benefit plans 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
a provision for claims under this self insured program  based on our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  is revised and recorded annually 
the estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to actuarial estimates 
the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although  we believe that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect our self insurance obligations  future expense and cash flow 
at january  and december   the self insurance reserves totaled million and million  respectively

 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in 
table of contents determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
fsp was effective immediately upon issuance  and includes prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we applied the guidance contained in fsp in determining fair values beginning on september   although it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
sfas classifies inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  which may affect our operating results and financial position 
when deemed appropriate  we minimize our risks from interest rate fluctuations through the use of an interest rate swap 
this derivative financial instrument is used to manage risk and is not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the swap is valued using a valuation model that has inputs other than quoted market prices that are both observable and unobservable 
we endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring the fair value of the interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
to determine fair value of the interest rate swap we used the discounted estimated future cash flows methodology 
assumptions critical to our fair value in the period were i 
the present value factors used in determining fair value ii 
projected libor  and iii 
the risk of counterparty non performance risk 
these and other assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management 
we have determined that the fair value of our interest rate swap is a level measurement in the fair value hierarchy 
the level measurement is the risk of counterparty non performance on the interest rate swap liability that is not secured by cash collateral 
the risk of counterparty non performance did not affect the fair value at january  due to the fact that the interest rate swap was supported by cash collateral 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million and million at january  and december   respectively 
the implementation of sfas for financial assets and financial liabilities  effective december   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we have elected the provisions of fsp  however  we do not expect the implementation of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks such as changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we employ a variety of practices to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading  and are not used to address risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we record derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
less than of our net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and we do not believe our total exposure to currency fluctuations to be significant 
we believe that general inflation did not significantly affect our operating results or markets in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal as discussed above  our results of operations were both favorably and 
table of contents unfavorably impacted by increases and decreases in the pricing of certain commodity based products 
commodity price fluctuations have from time to time created cyclicality in our financial performance and may do so in the future 
on june   certain special purpose entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries of ours entered into a million mortgage loan with the german american capital corporation 
the mortgage has a term of ten years and a fixed interest rate of 
by entering into this mortgage  we insulated ourselves from changes in market interest rates on a portion of our indebtedness 
this mortgage replaced our previously existing million floating rate mortgage  which had a interest rate when it was terminated 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with goldman sachs capital markets  to hedge against interest rate risks related to our variable rate revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and the terms call for us to receive interest monthly at a variable rate equal to the day libor and to pay interest monthly at a fixed rate of 
this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge 
at january  and december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million and million  respectively 
these balances were included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
at january   we had approximately million of cash collateral held related to the interest rate swap liability 
accumulated other comprehensive loss income at january  and december  included the net loss on the cash flow hedge net of tax of million and million  respectively  which reflects the cumulative amount of comprehensive loss recognized in connection with the change in fair value of the swap 
our revolving credit facility accrues interest based on a floating benchmark rate the prime rate or libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
a change in interest rates under the revolving credit facility would have an impact on our results of operations 
a change of basis points in the market rate of interest would have an immaterial impact based on borrowings outstanding at january  additionally  to the extent changes in interest rates impact the housing market  we would be impacted by such changes
