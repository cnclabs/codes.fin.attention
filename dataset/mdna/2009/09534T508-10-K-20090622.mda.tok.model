overview we sell a family of proxy appliances and related software and services 
proxy appliances are computer hardware devices that  together with internal software  optimize and secure the delivery of business applications and other information over a wan or across an enterprise s internet gateway  where its local computer network links to the public internet 
on june   we acquired packeteer  a pioneer in delivering sophisticated wan traffic prioritization  for a purchase price of approximately million 
packeteer developed and sold application classification and performance management products 
much of our focus during fiscal was on integrating the business of packeteer into our existing business and creating a single organization including an integrated sales force designed to take advantage of cost  management  technology  sales and market synergies 
as well  we sought to make the packeteer products  in particular the packetshaper product  a key part of our product offering and business strategy 
in fiscal  we developed  articulated and commenced implementation of our business strategy to be the leader in the market for products and services that comprise an application delivery network adn infrastructure 
we look at an adn infrastructure as a set of products and services that provides visibility into the business applications operating on a network  as well as securing and optimizing the delivery of those applications 
while much of our focus during the past two fiscal years has been in the area of wan optimization  we believe that our ability to differentiate wan optimization with our traditional secure web gateway products and technologies and with the application performance monitoring products and technologies we acquired from packeteer is fundamental to our current and continued success 

table of contents we continue to monitor the current unfavorable and uncertain global macroeconomic conditions  and their actual and anticipated impact on it spending 
while we believe that our adn products offer an attractive return on investment and that sales of our products have been less affected by current conditions than many it products  the current economy has affected our ability to close sales transactions 
we believe that many customers are postponing spending  which means that sales can take longer to close 
despite the challenging economic environment  we continued to hire sales personnel during fiscal to address and grow our current and anticipated market 
we have recently revised our sales and logistics operations in significant respects to better and more efficiently serve our customers and end users 
while historically we have assigned territory based sales teams to provide sales coverage  we have tiered our sales model to provide sales managers focused on the level of sales opportunity  which we classify as strategic  large enterprise and mid tier 
we also have allocated and aligned our sales support personnel  such as sales engineers  based on their skill sets  rather than assigning them to a single sales team 
these changes are intended to increase product revenue and to decrease our selling costs as a percentage of revenue  as well as to provide more focused service to our customers 
in fiscal  we developed a plan to revise our global logistics practices to ship directly to our end user customers and value added resellers worldwide 
we will be implementing these revised practices in fiscal this will not materially impact our distribution practices in north america  latin america and asia pacific  where most of our distributors do not stock inventory 
however  it will constitute a significant change in our europe  middle east and africa region  where the stocking of our products is common 
while we will continue using a two tier distribution scheme where distributors provide added value  such as professional services and training  pre sales support  post sales support and marketing activities  the added value will no longer include stocking and shipping our products 
we believe that this model will prove more efficient and cost effective  and will result in a higher level of customer satisfaction 
we track many financial metrics as key measures of our business performance  including net revenue  operating margin  deferred revenue  cash flow from operations  and cash position 
net revenue net revenue  which includes product and service revenue  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net product revenue in fiscal was million  a million increase compared to fiscal the increase in product revenue was primarily due to revenue attributable to packeteer products and increased sales of existing products 
net product revenue primarily includes sales of our proxy and packetshaper appliances and licenses to our blue coat webfilter product 
included in product revenue is million in sales attributable to packeteer products 
we recognized million in service revenue in fiscal  a million increase compared to fiscal included in service revenue is million attributable to packeteer services 
the balance of the increase was driven primarily by the continued growth in our installed base  resulting in an increase in sales of service contracts and renewal service contracts 
operating margin in fiscal  our operating income decreased to million from operating income of million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease was attributable to a reduction in our gross profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal  as well as increased operating expenses of million which were of revenue for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year our fiscal gross profit margin was negatively impacted by million as a consequence of the sale of acquired packeteer inventory that had been written up to its estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and additionally  by the loss of million of service revenue due to the write down of packeteer s deferred service revenue to fair value  in each case  as required by purchase accounting rules 
at april   million of the fair value write up on the acquired packeteer inventory and million of the fair value write down on packeteer s 
table of contents deferred service revenue remained to be recognized 
operating expenses primarily consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets 
personnel related costs  including stock based compensation  are the primary driver of each of these expense categories and the increase in operating expenses in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we incurred restructuring  integration and transition costs of million 
as of april  we had  employees  an increase of from the  employees at april  the majority of the headcount increases in fiscal were in sales  research and development and customer support 
deferred revenue net deferred revenue was million at april  compared to million at april  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in new service contracts sold with our appliances  as well as the renewal of service contracts  offset by a reduction in inventory held by our distributors attributable to distributor inventory management in anticipation of our change to a new fulfillment model during fiscal to direct shipment of our products to end user customers and value added resellers 
once this transition is complete  our distributors will no longer hold inventory and  consequently  distributor inventory stocking orders will no longer be included in our deferred revenue at sales value  but will be included in our inventory at cost 
cash flow from operations and cash position during fiscal  we generated cash flow from operations of million  compared to million generated during fiscal the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher cash collections  offset by certain payments made related to our packeteer acquisition  including transaction costs  severance payments and other liabilities assumed as a result of the packeteer acquisition  and lower net income of million 
our cash  restricted cash and short term investments were million at april   compared to million at april  the overall decrease in our cash and equivalents balance was primarily due to the cash used for our packeteer acquisition  partially offset by the proceeds received from our convertible debt issuance on june  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  supply chain liabilities and valuation of inventories  acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  income taxes  and legal and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 
we have discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments that materially affect our financial statements and are critical to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts stock based compensation 
table of contents supply chain liabilities and valuation of inventories acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets income taxes legal and other contingencies revenue recognition our products include stand alone software and software that is essential to the functionality of our appliances 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades through maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  sop and all related interpretations 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we define each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and  in certain instances  sales contracts or agreements 
delivery or performance has occurred 
we use shipping and related documents  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance 
through fiscal  most of our sales were made through distributors under agreements that  in most cases  allow for stock rotation rights 
net revenue and the related cost of net revenue resulting from shipments of products to distributors are deferred until the distributors report that our products have been sold to a customer 
product revenue in china is deferred until the customer registers its purchase of the proxy appliance 
for direct sales to end users and value added resellers  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which generally is upon shipment 
we do not accept orders from value added resellers when we are aware that the value added reseller does not have an order from an end user customer 
we generally do not have significant obligations for future performance  such as rights of return or pricing credits  associated with sales to end users and value added resellers 
the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection on a customer by customer basis 
we subject our customers to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for our products and services 
if we conclude that collection is not probable based upon our initial review  we do not recognize revenue until cash is received 
for products in an arrangement that includes multiple elements  such as appliances  maintenance or software  we use the residual method to recognize revenue for the delivered elements 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements  provided that vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we analyze our stand alone maintenance renewals by sales channel and service offering strata 
we determine the vsoe of fair value for maintenance by analyzing our stand alone maintenance renewals and noting that a substantial majority of transactions fall within a narrow range for each stratum 
in limited cases  vsoe of fair value has been based on management determined prices 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized at the earlier of delivery of those elements or establishment of fair value for the remaining undelivered elements 
when vsoe of fair value cannot be determined for any undelivered maintenance  subscription or service elements  revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the maintenance  subscription or service period 

table of contents maintenance and subscription revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract  with the related expenses recognized as incurred 
maintenance and subscription contracts usually have a term of one to three years 
unearned maintenance and subscription revenue is included in deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer geographic concentrations  customer solvency  current economic and geographic trends  and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of such allowance  and record any required changes in the allowance account to general and administrative expense 
we write off accounts receivable when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
stock based compensation effective may   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expenses recognized beginning on that date include a compensation expense for all unvested share based payments granted prior to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate this compensation expense 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of options  the expected price volatility of the stock underlying such options  the risk free interest rate  and the expected forfeiture rate 
for options granted before may   we amortize the fair value on a graded basis over the vesting period  which results in greater expense recorded in earlier years than the straight line method 
for options granted on or after may   we amortize the fair value of stock based compensation on a straight line basis for options expected to vest 
the fair value of all options is amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our total and per share net income or loss 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on our historical experience of grants  exercises and post vesting cancellations 
beginning with our adoption of sfas no 
r on may  until april   the expected option term was years 
effective may  and continuing through april   we estimated the expected option term at years based on our updated experience of grants  exercises and post vesting cancellations 
we estimate the volatility of our stock options at the date of grant using a combination of historical and implied volatilities  consistent with sfas no 
r and sab no 
we base the risk free rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the expected term of our option grants 
stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  which requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
effective may  and continuing through april   we estimated our forfeiture rate at based on an analysis of historical pre vesting forfeitures  and have reduced stock based compensation expense accordingly 
from may  until april   we used a forfeiture rate of 

table of contents supply chain liabilities and valuation of inventories we outsource most of our manufacturing  product fulfillment  repair  and supply chain management operations to contract manufacturers  and a significant portion of our cost of revenues is a result of this activity 
our contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on demand forecasts that we prepare 
these forecasts are based on estimates of future product demand and are adjusted for overall market conditions 
if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted  it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market  after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand  the timing of new product introductions  economic trends and market conditions 
acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value of intangible assets  including acquired technology and customer relationships  is based on significant judgments made by management 
we typically engage third party valuation appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of the assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the assets include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
acquisition related identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives  which are three to seven years for developed technology and patents  five years for core technology  five to seven years for customer relationships and two years for trade name 
we perform annual goodwill impairment tests in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  during our fourth fiscal quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the first step of the test identifies whether potential impairment may have occurred  and the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
an impairment of goodwill is recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires the application of significant judgment 
for purposes of the annual impairment test  we consider our market capitalization compared to the carrying amount of our assets on the date of the test  since we have only one reporting unit 
we performed our annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that no impairment existed at april  we periodically evaluate potential impairments of our long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value as calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 

table of contents income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our income tax expense and calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary difference resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of the amortization of certain intangible assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to an amount that we estimate is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will be realizable by either refundable income taxes or future taxable income  the valuation allowance will be reduced and the related tax impact will be recorded as a reduction to the tax provision in that quarter 
likewise  should we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be recorded as an increase to the tax provision in the period such determination was made 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  the availability of tax credits and carryforwards  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  and the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
on may   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we review our uncertain tax benefits quarterly  and we may adjust such uncertain tax benefits because of proposed assessments by tax authorities  changes in facts and circumstances  issuance of new regulations or new case law  previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination  negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices  resolution with respect to individual audit issues  the resolution of entire audits  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
in addition  our tax contingency reserve includes certain amounts for potential tax assessments for pre acquisition tax years of acquired companies  which  if recognized  will be recorded to our provision for income taxes upon our adoption of sfas r  business combinations  in fiscal legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for damages arising from litigation or other loss contingencies only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the 
table of contents financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending loss contingencies and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

gross profit the following is a summary of gross profit by fiscal year year ended april  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was consistent with the increase in net revenue 
gross profit margin in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal  primarily attributable to higher costs associated with acquired packeteer products  including million of higher costs of net revenues associated with sale of inventories written up to fair value in connection with the packeteer acquisition  million of amortization of acquired intangible assets  and the million write down of deferred service revenue to fair value in connection with the packeteer acquisition  all as required by purchase accounting rules 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit margin compared to fiscal were increased manufacturing expenses and other cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue 
we expect gross margins to improve in fiscal due to a decreased impact on cost of goods sold and service revenue from the remaining packeteer fair value purchase accounting adjustments 
fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was attributable to the increase in net revenue and higher gross profit margin 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit margin in fiscal increased to from in fiscal  primarily due to more favorable product pricing  a product mix favoring higher margin products such as blue coat webfilter  and higher overall revenue resulting in more effective leverage of fixed product costs  partially offset by higher royalty expense

the increase in sales and marketing expense was consistent with our plans to invest resources in the wan optimization market and promotion of our application delivery network strategy 

table of contents sales and marketing headcount was at april  and at april  during fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales force  increase sales in both us and international markets and establish and expand new distribution channels  however  we expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue to decline as we manage our discretionary spending  as well as through organizational efficiencies 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing expense increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales and marketing expense increased as we continued to expand our sales force and invest in marketing personnel 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a million increase in salaries and benefits as a result of this activity and related expenses such as an million increase in commission expense  primarily due to the increase in revenue  coupled with more aggressive sales incentives for wan acceleration deployments and further development of emerging markets 
also contributing to the increase in sales and marketing expense was an increase in stock based compensation expense of million and an increase in advertising of million

amortization of intangible assets we completed the acquisition of packeteer on june  the acquired intangible assets associated with the packeteer acquisition consist of developed technology and patents  customer relationships and trade name 
developed technology is comprised of products that have reached technological feasibility and are a part of packeteer s product lines  and patents related to the design and development of packeteer s products 
customer relationships represent packeteer s underlying relationships with its customers 
trade name represents the fair value of brand and name recognition associated with the marketing of packeteer s products and services 
the amounts assigned to customer relationships  developed technology and patents  and trade name were million  million  and million  respectively 
we amortize customer relationships  developed technology and patents  and trade name on a straight line basis over their weighted average expected useful life of   and years  respectively 
for the fiscal years  and  the amortization of intangible assets was related to our acquisition of packeteer  our september  acquisition of certain assets of the netcache business from network appliance  inc  our march  acquisition of permeo  inc  our november  acquisition of cerberian  inc 
and our november  acquisition of ositis software  inc the amortization of developed technology  patents and trade name is charged to cost of goods sold  while the amortization of core technology and customer relationships is charged to operating expense 
total amortization expense for our identifiable intangible assets for the fiscal years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
restructuring charges in connection with our acquisition of packeteer  we committed to a plan that resulted in the termination of the employment of employees of blue coat 
restructuring charges consist primarily of personnel related severance costs and stock based compensation expenses 
stock based compensation included in restructuring 
table of contents resulted primarily from the additional vesting of unvested option shares and restricted shares upon termination of the employment of those employees pursuant to the terms of their separation agreements 
the termination of employment of all employees occurred during the first quarter of fiscal  and we recorded a restructuring accrual of million in our consolidated statements of operations  including million of stock based compensation related to the modification of certain equity awards 
during fiscal  we paid severance in the amount of million related to this accrual 
we do not anticipate future charges related to this plan and anticipate the remaining balance of the restructuring accrual to be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal interest income  interest expense and other expense interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and marketable securities 
cash has historically been invested in highly liquid investments such as time deposits held at major banks  commercial paper  us government agency discount notes  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with maturities at the date of purchase of days or less 
at april   our cash was predominately invested in money market mutual funds 
other expense consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains or losses  banking fees  and non recurring gains or losses realized outside our normal course of business 
the following is a summary of interest income  interest expense and other expense by fiscal year year ended april  in thousands interest income interest expense other expense fiscal compared to fiscal interest income decreased for fiscal year compared to fiscal as a result of our reduced cash balances together with a decrease in our average investment yield due to lower interest rates and because a majority of our cash and cash equivalents was invested in money market funds 
in addition  interest expense increased in fiscal due to the amortization of the fair value of our warrants and a beneficial conversion feature associated with our convertible senior notes 
other expense consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange losses of million and an impairment charge of million taken on a note receivable 
foreign exchange losses increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  particularly during the first half of the fiscal year when the us dollar strengthened against foreign currencies during the comparable period in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal interest income increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal primarily as a result of higher average cash and investment balances throughout the year 
other expense consisted primarily of foreign currency exchange gains or losses 
in addition  other expense for fiscal and included payroll taxes and related penalties for the disqualification of stock options caused by the revised measurement dates determined during the investigation of historical stock option granting practices 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended april  was million compared to million for the year ended april  the provision primarily reflects current us federal and state income taxes  foreign income taxes in taxable foreign jurisdictions and changes in our valuation allowance

table of contents on february   the california budget act of was signed into law which revised certain provisions of the california state tax code  including the option to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to california for tax years beginning on or after january  we now expect that in fiscal years and beyond  our income subject to tax in california will be lower than under prior tax law 
this change in law did not impact our current tax provision nor do we expect it to have a material impact on our future effective tax rate 
our provision for income taxes increased for the year ended april  compared to the year ended april   primarily due to lower current year earnings  an increase in the valuation allowance for the current fiscal year  partially offset by a reduction in the amount of unbenefitted foreign losses 
the benefit for income taxes of million for fiscal is primarily related to a partial reversal of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that was recorded as a reduction to income tax expense  partially offset by foreign income taxes and the current tax provision for us federal and state taxes due primarily from a prepayment of certain intercompany expenses associated with our foreign subsidiaries 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including operating results  our history of losses and forecasts of future taxable income 
our conclusion that a portion of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not to be realized is strongly influenced by our projections of future taxable income 
our estimate of future taxable income considers available positive and negative evidence regarding our current and future operations  including projections of income in various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we believe our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable  however  it is inherently uncertain  and if our future operations generate taxable income greater than projected  we may record reductions to our valuation allowance 
conversely  if our ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the deferred tax asset is materially reduced  we may record additions to our valuation allowance 
at april   our projections of future taxable income enabled us to conclude that it is more likely than not that we can realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we have recognized deferred tax assets of million million of federal and million of state at april  the recognition of deferred tax assets in the current year was recorded as a provision for income taxes of million and a credit to goodwill related to recognition of packeteer deferred tax assets of million 
at april  and  we had a valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively  which when released will benefit the income tax provision 
the net increase in the valuation allowance was primarily due to a tax accounting methodology change and certain adjustments identified upon filing our federal and state income tax returns 
as of april   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in fiscal years ending in through if not utilized 
we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in fiscal years through if not utilized 
of the total tax attributes  we have million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax asset was recorded until the tax benefit relating to excess stock compensation deduction is realized in accordance with footnote of sfas r 
we also had federal and california credit carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively 
the federal research credit carryforwards will expire in fiscal years  and if not utilized 
the federal alternative minimum tax credit and california credit carryforwards are not subject to expiration 
utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
annual limitations have resulted in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization of approximately million and million  respectively 
utilization of federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  respectively  as well as million and million of 
table of contents federal and state credits  respectively  are subject to annual limitations ranging from approximately million to million 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of april   and were million  million and million  respectively 
included in our gross unrecognized tax benefits as of april  is approximately million of tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in an adjustment to our effective tax rate 
in accordance with fin  we have elected to classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes 
accrued interest and penalties relating to our unrecognized tax benefits was approximately million  million and million as of april   and  respectively  with approximately million and million included as a component of our provision for income taxes for fiscal year and  respectively 
due to our taxable loss position from inception through fiscal year  all tax years are subject to examination in us federal and state jurisdictions 
we are also subject to examination in various foreign jurisdictions for tax years forward  none of which are individually material 
we are unable to anticipate the change in the balance of the unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to the possibility of tax examinations and our continued assessment of potential contingencies 
acquisitions we acquired packeteer  a provider of sophisticated wan traffic prioritization technologies  on june   by means of a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into packeteer  such that packeteer became our wholly owned subsidiary 
of the total estimated purchase price of million for packeteer  approximately million was allocated to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill resulting from business combinations subsequent to june  is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually more frequently if certain indicators are present 
in the event that management determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired  the combined company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made 
our acquisition of packeteer did not result in the creation of a new business segment 
on june   we issued million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  the convertible senior notes and warrants the warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of to manchester securities corp  an affiliate of elliott associate  llp manchester and francisco partners ii  lp and francisco partners parallel fund ii  lp together  the fp entities in a private placement 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash provided by operating activities  private sales of preferred and common stock  bank loans  equipment leases  private sales of convertible notes and warrants and an initial public offering of our common stock 
cash equivalents and short term investments we consider all highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date based on our intent and ability to use such funds for current operations 
short term investments consist primarily of commercial paper and corporate 
table of contents securities with original maturities between three months and one year 
to date  all of our investments have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  if any  included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurement  except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not required to be measured on a recurring basis as deferred under sfas no 
the fair value of these securities is determined in accordance with sfas and is based on quoted market prices in active markets 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million 
we paid million in cash for the packeteer acquisition  which closed during the first quarter of fiscal the packeteer acquisition was funded primarily from our cash balance of million as of april  and the issuance of the convertible senior notes and associated warrants  which generated net proceeds of million 
in addition  we acquired cash of million as a result of the packeteer acquisition 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and anticipated cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
we may seek to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial condition  facilitate expansion and pursue strategic acquisitions or investments  or to take advantage of other business opportunities as they arise 
the following summarizes cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash april  dollars in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments restricted cash percentage of total assets should prevailing economic conditions or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our future cash requirements  or if cash is used for unanticipated purposes  we may need additional capital sooner than expected 
although we believe that we can achieve our planned cash flow for fiscal  we cannot guarantee such achievement 
as well  given the current uncertainty in debt and equity capital markets  we cannot guarantee that  should it be required  sufficient debt or equity capital will be available to us under acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
cash flow year ended april  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers who purchase our products and services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  product costs  and facility related payments 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher cash collections  reflected by our days sales outstanding decreasing from days at april  to days at april  these increases were offset by certain payments made related to our packeteer acquisition  including transaction costs  severance payments and other liabilities assumed as a result of the packeteer acquisition and lower net income 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this increase was largely attributable to growth in net income for the fiscal year as well as net changes in our working capital 
increases in working capital sources of cash were primarily driven by increases in deferred revenue as a result of an increase in new service contracts sold with our appliances and the renewal of service contracts from our expanding installed base  both of which are recognized ratably over the service period  increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to increased operating expenses  and increases in accrued payroll and related benefits due to increased headcount and a higher commission accrual 
working capital uses of cash during fiscal included an increase in our accounts receivable balance of million  largely due to higher net revenue in fiscal and an increase in our days sales outstanding from days at april  to days at april   which was largely attributable to a greater concentration of revenue recognized in the last month of fiscal year compared to fiscal also contributing to working capital uses of cash was an increase in net deferred tax assets of million as a result of the partial release in our valuation allowance 
cash provided by used in investing activities fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million provided by investing activities in the same period last year 
the increase in cash used by investing activities in comparison to fiscal was primarily due to cash used to purchase packeteer of million  net of cash acquired  and million of increased purchases of property and equipment  consisting primarily of furniture and leasehold improvements 
fiscal included million of cash used for the purchase of packeteer common stock and million used for the purchase of property and equipment  offset by million related to the escrow release from the netcache acquisition and net proceeds from the sale and maturities and purchases of investment securities of million

cash provided by financing activities fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million provided in the same period last year 
the increase in financing activities was primarily due to the net proceeds of million from our issuance of the convertible senior notes and associated warrants  offset by lower employee stock option exercises and purchases of our stock under our employee stock purchase plan and related tax benefits 
the net cash provided by our financing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases of our stock under our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and a tax benefit related to stock based compensation of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily related to net proceeds of million received from our sale of series a preferred stock 
our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and short term investments 
contractual obligations below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations as of april  year ended april  thereafter total in thousands long term debt obligations future minimum lease payments purchase and other commitments total we lease certain office equipment and office facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through the facility leases generally require us to pay operating costs  including property taxes  insurance and maintenance  and contain scheduled rent increases and certain other rent escalation clauses 
rent expense is recognized in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases after consideration of rent holidays and improvement allowances  if applicable 
any assets purchased using a lessee improvement allowance are capitalized as fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the lease term 
in september  we commenced a five year operating lease of a building that serves as our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
on june   we amended the lease for our corporate headquarters 
pursuant to the lease amendment  we added  additional square feet of space comprising an additional building and extended the term of the lease through november  the lease amendment provides for an annualized base rent ranging from million to million for the new premises during the term of the lease applicable to the new premises  which commenced on november  the lease amendment provides for an annualized base rent ranging from million to million for the existing premises during the extension term  which commences on september  in connection with the lease  we are required to maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit with a major financial institution as a form of security 
the amount of the letter of credit was reduced to million during fiscal from million at april  and the expiration date was extended to february the letter of credit is secured by deposits and provides for automatic annual extensions  without amendment  for a period of one year on each successive expiration date  but no later than the lease expiration of november  the deposits securing the letter of credit are classified as long term restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of april  and  respectively 
at april   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million 
due to uncertainties with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at april   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 

table of contents we have firm purchase and other commitments with various suppliers and contract manufacturers to purchase component inventory  manufacturing material and equipment 
these agreements are enforceable and legally binding against us in the short term and all amounts under these arrangements are due to be paid by the end of fiscal our minimum obligation under these arrangements at april  was million 
in addition  we have obligations under a cross patent license agreement of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities  nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  or obligations that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements for information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including changes in exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposures to exchange and interest rate risks  and we are not a party to any risk management transactions 
we also do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for hedging  speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of million 
these amounts are primarily held in money market funds 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which is intended to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the majority of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we primarily develop products in the united states and sell them throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign markets 
because all of our sales are currently billed and collected in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could potentially make our products less price competitive in foreign markets 
if the events described above were to occur  our net revenue and earnings could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings are derived from international operations 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net revenue was derived from customers outside of north america 
in contrast  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  however  we do not expect that the risks associated with our international operations will be material
