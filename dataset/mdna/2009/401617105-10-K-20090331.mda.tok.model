item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general unless the context indicates otherwise  when we refer to we  us or the company in this form k  we are referring to guess  inc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
business segments the business segments of the company are retail  wholesale  european and licensing operations 
information relating to these segments is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes this segment reporting reflects how its four business segments are managed and each segment s performance is evaluated 
the retail segment includes the company s retail operations in north america 
the wholesale segment includes the wholesale operations in north america and our asian operations 
the european segment includes both wholesale and retail operations in europe and the middle east 
the licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the company 
the business segments operating results exclude corporate overhead costs  which consist of shared costs of the organization 
these costs are presented separately and generally include  among other things  the following unallocated corporate costs information technology  human resources  accounting and finance  global advertising and marketing  executive compensation  facilities and legal 
we acquired focus europe srl focus  our former licensee for guess by marciano products in europe  the middle east and asia  in december  and its spanish subsidiary focus spain in october we also acquired barn srl barn  our former kids licensee in europe  in january each of these entities is reported in our european segment 
g by guess is a relatively new retail brand concept that was launched in early fiscal and is included in our retail segment 
our south korea business  which we have operated directly since january  and our greater china business  launched in april  are also relatively new businesses for us and are reported in our wholesale segment 
products we derive our net revenue from the sale of guess men s and women s apparel  g by guess men s and women s apparel  guess by marciano men s and women s apparel  and our licensees products through our worldwide network of retail stores  wholesale customers and distributors  as well as our on line stores 
we also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities 
recent global economic developments the global economic environment has deteriorated over the past several months 
the declining values in real estate  reduced credit lending by banks  solvency concerns of major financial institutions  increases in unemployment levels and recent significant declines and volatility in the global financial markets have negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items 
this has affected our business as it is dependent on consumer demand for our products 
in north america we have experienced a significant slowdown in customer traffic and a highly promotional environment 
these same conditions are now spreading to many international markets 
if the global macroeconomic environment continues to be weak or deteriorates further  there will likely be a negative effect on the company s revenues and earnings across all of our segments for fiscal in addition  the recent deterioration in the global economic environment has resulted in significant volatility in the global currency markets 
the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the canadian dollar  the euro and the korean won 
the recent volatility has resulted in a substantial strengthening of the us dollar against these three currencies 
a relatively stronger us dollar will result in our international operating results translating into lower us 
table of contents dollar amounts 
these conditions could negatively impact our results of operations and the company s ability to generate both revenue and earnings growth 
in addition  certain transactions that occur in canada  europe and south korea are denominated in us dollars and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their local functional currencies 
these types of transactions include us denominated purchases of merchandise and intercompany liabilities 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts and currency swaps  to manage exchange risk on certain foreign currency transactions 
the company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency 
other on january   the board of directors of the company approved a change in the company s fiscal year end from december to the saturday nearest january of each year 
the change  which became effective for the company s fiscal year  aligned the company s reporting cycle with the national retail federation nrf fiscal calendar to provide for more consistent year to year comparisons 
the company s fiscal year began on february  and ended on february   resulting in a one month transition period that began january  and ended february  the audited results for the one month ended february  are included in item exhibits  financial statement schedules 
unless specifically indicated otherwise  fiscal relates to the twelve months ended january   fiscal relates to the twelve months ended february  and fiscal relates to the unaudited twelve months ended february  for purposes of this md a  the company has presented the financial performance comparison of the fiscal year versus the fiscal year and the fiscal year versus the fiscal year 
fiscal years and include weeks while fiscal includes weeks 
the company reports nrf calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for its full price retail and factory outlet stores in the us and canada 
a store is considered comparable after it has been open for full months 
if a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than  or involves a relocation or a change in store concept  the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size  in its new location or under its new concept for full months 
executive summary the company the company s operations generated net earnings of million  or diluted earnings of per share  for the year ended january   compared to net earnings of million  or diluted earnings of per share  for the year ended february  the fiscal results included the benefit over the prior year of a lower effective tax rate which favorably impacted tax expense by million or per diluted share and a favorable impact of currency translation to earnings from operations of million or per diluted share 
this was partially offset by an unfavorable impact in fiscal of long lived asset impairment charges of million or per diluted share 
the asset impairment charge reflected the write down of the asset base for a number of our retail stores in north america and asia as a result of adverse retail conditions arising from the recent deterioration in the global economic environment 
total net revenues increased to  million for the year ended january   from  million for the year ended february  all our business segments contributed to this growth 
the european segment was the largest contributor to the growth in revenues  representing over half of the consolidated revenue growth 
retail store expansion in north america and the expansion of our operations in asia also contributed to the growth in revenues  while our licensing business increased revenues across all key accessories categories and footwear 

table of contents gross margin decreased basis points to for the year ended january  compared to the prior year 
the decline in the overall gross margin was attributable to lower product margins in our retail and wholesale segments partially offset by higher product margins in europe and a higher mix of european net revenues  which generated a relatively higher gross margin than the other segments 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended february  the increase in sg a expenses was driven by higher variable costs to support the higher sales in our existing businesses  asset impairment charges in north america and asia  investments in our newer businesses and investments in infrastructure in europe

the asset impairment charge negatively impacted sg a expense as a percentage of revenues by basis points 
earnings from operations increased to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the same period a year ago 
operating margin declined basis points to for the year ended january  compared to the prior year due to the lower gross margin and the increase in sg a spending as a percentage of net revenues 
the asset impairment charge negatively impacted operating margin by basis points 
net interest income decreased million for the year ended january  primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances and higher average debt balances in europe 
other expense  net increased by million for the year ended january  primarily due to the decline in the value of insurance policy investments and other non operating assets 
our effective income tax rate decreased basis points to for the year ended january   compared to in the prior year  primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents as of january   compared to million as of february  total debt  including capital lease obligations  as of january   was million  a decrease of million from million as of february  the decrease in debt was the combined result of a lower euro denominated balance at january  compared to the prior year end and the favorable translation effect of the relatively stronger us dollar 
accounts receivable increased by million  or  to million at january   compared to million at february  the increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from the revenue growth in europe 
changes in currency translation rates reduced the current year s accounts receivable balance by approximately million compared to the prior year 
approximately million of our european  us and canadian receivables  or of the million in accounts receivable at january   were insured for collection purposes or subject to certain bank guarantees 
inventory increased by million  or  to million as of january   compared to million as of february  most of the inventory increase was related to anticipated sales growth in our existing european operations 
the current year s inventory balance includes a negative translation impact of approximately million due to currency fluctuations compared to the prior year 
retail our retail segment  comprising north american full priced retail and factory outlet stores and e commerce  generated net sales of million during the year ended january   an increase of from million in the prior year period 
this growth was driven by a larger store base  which represented a net increase in average square footage compared to the year ended february   and an increase in comparable store sales of for the year ended january  retail earnings from operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the prior year period 
in addition  the operating margin decreased by basis 
table of contents points to for the year ended january   compared to for the year ended february  the declines in both earnings from operations and operating margin were driven by asset impairment charges in the retail segment of million and lower product margins 
the decrease in earnings from operations was partially offset by the increased earnings due to the increased sales volume from the larger store base and lower advertising and marketing costs 
the asset impairment charges negatively impacted operating margin by basis points 
we opened new stores  closed five underperforming stores and converted one full price retail store to a guess accessories store in the us and canada during fiscal at january   we operated stores in the us and canada  comprised of guess full priced retail stores  guess factory outlet stores  guess by marciano stores  g by guess stores and guess accessories stores

earnings from operations for the wholesale segment decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the prior year period 
the decrease was driven by lower product margins in our north american wholesale business as well as higher product related costs and additional occupancy and sg a expenses  largely to support our expanding asian operations 
operating margin decreased by basis points to in the year ended january   compared to for the prior year period 
the lower north american wholesale product margins  additional operating expenses in asia and the overall mix of our asia business  where operating margins are lower than in our north american wholesale business  drove the operating margin decrease 
europe in europe  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended february  the majority of the revenue growth was generated by the european wholesale business  driven by growth in both our existing accessories and apparel businesses and our acquisition of barn in january in addition  at january   we directly operated stores in europe  compared to stores at the prior year end 
as a result  european retail revenues  including new stores  increased by for the year ended january   compared to the prior year

licensing our licensing business revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended february  this increase was driven by growth in sales of several product categories  especially watches  jewelry  footwear  eyewear and handbags 
licensing segment earnings from operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the prior year period 
operating margin increased basis points to for the year ended january  compared to for the prior year period 

table of contents outside of the us and canada  in the year ended january   together with our partners we opened new stores  including in europe  in asia and in the combined area of mexico  central and south america 
we ended the year with stores outside of the us and canada  of which were guess stores  were guess accessories stores  and were guess by marciano stores 
of the stores  were operated by the company and were operated by licensees or distributors 
this store count does not include jean and accessory concessions located in asia and europe because of their smaller store size in relation to our standard international store size 
corporate overhead corporate overhead  included in sg a  decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended january   from million for the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to lower compensation related expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  sales return allowances  loyalty accrual  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes  workers compensation accruals  litigation accruals  pension obligations and stock based compensation 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria is performed 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net revenues  and are included in the allowance for accounts receivable 
historically  these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of the economic conditions 
during fiscal  the company renegotiated its arrangements with its major customers in the us to fix the percentage of sales that will be expensed as markdown allowances 
the negotiation of a fixed rate allows the company to process credit memos against the outstanding balance immediately which has resulted in a reduction of our outstanding markdown allowance accrual 

table of contents sales returns reserves the company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience 
the company s policy allows retail customers a day period to return merchandise following the date of sale 
substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost primarily weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors its off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
an asset is considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
we use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates 
future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management s estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life  if shorter 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of the amendment of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
the discount rate is an important element of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate this critical assumption annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for supplemental executive retirement plan related information 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected favorable or unfavorable 
table of contents outcome of each claim 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and will revise estimates as appropriate 
as new claims arise  such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payments  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized after january  included a compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for new grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility 
implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the company s common stock 
the expected life used prior to november was based on the simplified method described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
for options granted beginning november  the expected term is determined based on historical trends 
the dividend yield for the one month period ended february  and prior years was zero 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the board of directors authorized and approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend 
the expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data 
compensation expense for new stock options and nonvested stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in addition  the company grants certain nonvested stock awards and stock options that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order for these awards to vest 
if the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved  no expense is recorded during the period 
taxes the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  in january fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the adoption of fin in accordance with sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized

gift card breakage gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods 
beginning with the quarter ended august   these estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed 
the company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns  which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the recognition of gift card breakage

the company s derivative financial instruments are recorded in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates 
the us dollar forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases over specific months 
changes in the fair value of the us dollar forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of product sales in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold 
the swiss franc forward contracts are used to hedge certain anticipated swiss operating expenses over specific months

sensitivity analysis at january   a sensitivity analysis of changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the us dollar indicates that  if the us dollar had uniformly weakened by against all of the us dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives totaling us million  the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by us million 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all of the us dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives  the fair value of these instruments would have increased by us million 
any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments may be more than or partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions primarily us dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate 
the ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle

the change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap increased other expense  net by million during fiscal year substantially all of the company s remaining indebtedness  principally consisting of short term borrowings under the short term european borrowing agreements  is at variable rates of interest 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s results of operations in future periods 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended january  by approximately million 
the fair value of the company s debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the company s incremental borrowing rate 
at january   the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value  as the interest rate on the company s debt approximates rates currently available to the company
