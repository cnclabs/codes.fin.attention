item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
company risks the uncertain global economic environment could reduce our revenues and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current global economic recession could materially hurt our business in a number of ways including  longer sales and renewal cycles  delays in adoption of our products  increased risk of competition for our products  increased risk of inventory obsolescence  higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue  delays in signing or failing to sign customer agreements  or signing customer agreements at reduced purchase levels 
in addition  our suppliers  customers  potential customers  and business partners are facing similar challenges  which could materially and adversely affect the level of business they conduct with us 
the current economic downturn may lead to a reduction in corporate  university  or government budgets for research and development in sectors including the automotive  aerospace  mobility  and medical sectors  which use our products 
sales of our products may be adversely affected by cuts in these research and development budgets 
furthermore  a prolonged tightening of the credit markets could significantly impact our ability to liquidate investments or reduce the rate of return on investments 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   have a history of losses  expect to experience losses in the future  and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
since  we have incurred losses in all but four recent quarters 
we need to generate significant ongoing revenue to return to profitability 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur expenses as we continue to develop our technologies  
table of contents increase our sales and marketing efforts  attempt to expand the market for touch enabled technologies and products and change our business  protect and enforce our intellectual property  pursue strategic relationships  acquire intellectual property or other assets from third parties  and invest in systems and processes to manage our business 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have little or no control or influence on our licensees design  manufacturing  promotion  distribution  or pricing of their products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  upon which we generate royalty revenue 
a key part of our business strategy is to license our intellectual property to companies that manufacture and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
sales of those products generate royalty and license revenue for us 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our total revenues were royalty and license revenues 
we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by our licensees  nor can we control consolidation within an industry which could either reduce the number of licensing products available or reduce royalty rates for the combined licensees 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from our licensees that they will continue to use our technologies in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our technologies may not be brought to market  achieve commercial acceptance  or otherwise generate meaningful royalty revenue for us 
for us to generate royalty revenue  licensees that pay us per unit royalties must manufacture and distribute products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion and generate consumer demand through marketing and other promotional activities 
if our licensees products fail to achieve commercial success or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
peak demand for products that incorporate our technologies  especially in the video console gaming and computer gaming peripherals market  typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand during the year end holiday season 
if our licensees do not ship products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion or fail to achieve strong sales in the fourth quarter of the calendar year  we may not receive related royalty and license revenue 
we may not be able to continue to derive significant revenues from makers of peripherals for popular video gaming platforms 
a significant portion of our gaming royalty revenues come from third party peripheral makers who make licensed gaming products designed for use with popular video game console systems from microsoft  sony  and nintendo 
video game console systems are closed  proprietary systems  and video game console system makers typically impose certain requirements or restrictions on third party peripheral makers who wish to make peripherals that will be compatible with a particular video game console system 
if third party peripheral makers cannot or are not allowed to obtain or satisfy these requirements or restrictions  our gaming royalty revenues could be significantly reduced 
furthermore  should a significant video game console maker choose to omit touch enabling capabilities from its console system or somehow restrict or impede the ability of third parties to make touch enabling peripherals  it may very well lead our gaming licensees to stop making products with touch enabling capabilities  thereby significantly reducing our gaming royalty revenues 
under the terms of our agreement with sony  sony receives a royalty free license to our worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits sony to make  use  and sell hardware  software  and services covered by our patents in 
table of contents its ps  ps  and ps systems for a fixed license payment 
the ps console system was launched in late in the united states and japan without force feedback capability 
sony has since released new ps controllers with vibration feedback 
we do not know to what extent sony will allow third party peripheral makers to make licensed ps gaming products with vibration feedback to interface with the ps console 
to the extent sony selectively limits their licensing to leading third party controller makers to make ps controllers with vibration feedback  our licensing revenue from third party ps peripherals will continue to be severely limited 
sony continues to sell the ps  and our third party licensees continue to sell licensed ps peripherals 
however  us sales of ps peripherals continue to decline as more consumers switch to the ps console system and other next generation console systems like the nintendo wii and microsoft xbox both the microsoft xbox and nintendo wii include touch enabling capabilities 
for the microsoft xbox video console system launched in november  microsoft has  to date  not yet broadly licensed third parties to produce peripherals for its xbox game console 
to the extent microsoft does not fully license third parties  microsoft s share of all aftermarket xbox game controller sales will likely remain high or increase  which we expect will limit our gaming royalty revenue 
additionally  microsoft is now making touch enabled steering wheel products covered by their royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents that could compete with our licensees current products for which we earn per unit royalties 
because we have a fixed payment license with microsoft  our royalty revenue from licensing in the gaming market and other consumer markets has declined and may further do so if microsoft increases its volume of sales of touch enabled gaming products and consumer products at the expense of our other licensees 
under the terms of our present agreement with microsoft  microsoft receives a royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents 
this license permits microsoft to make  use  and sell hardware  software  and services  excluding specified products  covered by our patents 
we will not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under our current agreement with microsoft 
microsoft has a significant share of the market for touch enabled console gaming computer peripherals and is pursuing other consumer markets such as mobile phones  pdas  and portable music players 
microsoft has significantly greater financial  sales  and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base than some of our other licensees 
in the event that microsoft increases its share of these markets  our royalty revenue from other licensees in these market segments might decline 
we generate revenues from touch enabling components that are sold and incorporated into third party products 
we have little or no control or influence over the design  manufacture  promotion  distribution  or pricing of those third party products 
part of our business strategy is to sell components that provide touch feedback capability in products that other companies design  manufacture  and sell 
sales of these components generate product revenue 
however  we do not control or influence the design  manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution  or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by those customers that buy these components 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from customers that they will continue to use our components in current or future products 
as a result  products incorporating our components may not be brought to market  meet quality control standards  or achieve commercial acceptance 
if the customers fail to stimulate and capitalize upon market demand for their products that include our components  or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 
the terms in our agreements may be construed by our licensees in a manner that is inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to other licensees  or in a manner that may require us to incur substantial costs to resolve conflicts over license terms 
we have entered into  and we expect to continue to enter into  agreements pursuant to which our licensees are granted rights under our technology and intellectual property 
these rights may be granted in certain fields of use  or with respect to certain market sectors or product categories  and may include exclusive rights or sublicensing rights 
we refer to the license terms and restrictions in our agreements  including  but not limited to  field of use definitions  market sector  and product category definitions  collectively as license provisions 

table of contents due to the continuing evolution of market sectors  product categories  and licensee business models  and to the compromises inherent in the drafting and negotiation of license provisions  our licensees may  at some time during the term of their agreements with us  interpret license provisions in their agreements in a way that is different from our interpretation of such license provisions  or in a way that is in conflict with the rights that we have granted to other licensees 
such interpretations by our licensees may lead to claims that we have granted rights to one licensee which are inconsistent with the rights that we have granted to another licensee 
in addition  after we enter into an agreement  it is possible that markets and or products  or legal and or regulatory environments  will evolve in a manner that we did not foresee or was not foreseeable at the time we entered into the agreement 
as a result  in any agreement  we may have granted rights that will preclude or restrict our exploitation of new opportunities that arise after the execution of the agreement 
if we are unable to enter into new licensing arrangements with our existing licensees and with additional third party manufacturers for our touch enabling technologies  our royalty revenue may not grow 
our revenue growth is significantly dependent on our ability to enter into new licensing arrangements 
our failure to enter into new or renewal of licensing arrangements will cause our operating results to suffer 
we face numerous risks in obtaining new licenses on terms consistent with our business objectives and in maintaining  expanding  and supporting our relationships with our current licensees 
these risks include the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with potential licensees  the competition we may face with the internal design teams of existing and potential licensees  difficulties in persuading product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology  and to disclose to us proprietary product development and other strategies  difficulties with persuading potential licensees who may have developed their own intellectual property or licensed intellectual property from other parties in areas related to ours to license our technology versus continuing to develop their own or license from other parties  challenges in demonstrating the compelling value of our technologies in new applications like mobile phones  portable devices  and touchscreens  difficulties in persuading existing and potential licensees to bear the development costs and risks necessary to incorporate our technologies into their products  difficulties in obtaining new 
automotive 
licensees for yet to be commercialized technology because their suppliers may not be ready to meet stringent quality and parts availability requirements  inability to sign new gaming licenses if the video console makers choose not to license third parties to make peripherals for their new consoles  and reluctance of content developers  mobile phone manufacturers  and service providers to sign license agreements without a critical mass of other such inter dependent supporters of the mobile phone industry also having a license  or without enough phones in the market that incorporate our technologies 
our recently announced consolidation of our medical operations may not be successful  and may negatively impact our business in march  we announced that we are consolidating the operations of our medical line of business with the rest of our business 
as a result of this consolidation  we will be moving the operations of our medical line of business from maryland to our headquarters in san jose  california 
consolidations and business restructurings involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the potential loss of key employees  customers and business partners  market uncertainty related to our future business plans  the incurrence of unexpected expenses or charges  diversion of management attention from other key areas of our business  negative impacts on employee morale  and other potential dislocations and disruptions to the business 
for  our medical line of business represented of our total revenues 
accordingly  if we are unable to manage this consolidation effectively  our overall business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property  and could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property litigation  whether brought by us or by others against us  has caused us to expend  and may cause us to expend in future periods  significant financial resources as well as divert management s time and efforts 
from time to time  we initiate claims against third parties that we believe infringe our intellectual property rights 
we intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may initiate litigation against parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation 
litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly  time consuming  and difficult to pursue in certain venues  and distracting to management and potential customers and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property 
in addition  any litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technologies  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements even before the issue of infringement has been decided on the merits 
if any litigation were not resolved in our favor  we could become subject to substantial damage claims from third parties and indemnification claims from our licensees 
we could be enjoined from the continued use of the technologies at issue without a royalty or license agreement 
royalty or license agreements  if required  might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a third party claiming infringement against us prevailed  and we may not be able to develop non infringing technologies or license the infringed or similar technologies on a timely and cost effective basis  our expenses could increase and our revenues could decrease 
while we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties  third parties may hold  or may in the future be issued  patents that could be infringed by our products or technologies 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us with respect to the products that we manufacture and the technologies that we license 
from time to time  we have received letters from companies  several of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do  asserting that some of our technologies  or those of our licensees  infringe their intellectual property rights 
certain of our licensees may receive similar letters from these or other companies from time to time 
such letters or subsequent litigation may influence our licensees decisions whether to ship products incorporating our technologies 
in addition  such letters may cause a dispute between our licensees and us over indemnification for the infringement claim 
any of these notices  or additional notices that we or our licensees could receive in the future from these or other companies  could lead to litigation against us  either regarding the infringement claim or the indemnification claim 
we have acquired patents from third parties and also license some technologies from third parties 
we must rely upon the owners of the patents or the technologies for information on the origin and ownership of the acquired or licensed technologies 
as a result  our exposure to infringement claims may increase 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of acquired or licensed technologies and indemnification to cover any breach of these representations 
however  representations may not be accurate and indemnification may not provide adequate compensation for breach of the representations 
intellectual property claims against our licensees  or us  whether or not they have merit  could be time consuming to defend  cause product shipment delays  require us to pay damages  harm existing license arrangements  or require us or our licensees to cease utilizing the technologies unless we can enter into licensing agreements 
licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  claims by third parties against our licensees could also result in claims by our licensees against us for indemnification 
the legal principles applicable to patents and patent licenses continue to change and evolve 
legislation and judicial decisions that make it easier for patent licensees to challenge the validity  enforceability  or infringement of patents  or make it more difficult for patent licensors to obtain a permanent injunction  obtain enhanced damages for willful infringement  or to obtain or enforce patents  may adversely affect our business and the value of our patent portfolio 
furthermore  our prospects for future revenue growth through our royalty and licensing based businesses could be diminished 

table of contents our current litigation undertakings are expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  and will continue to be  until resolved  and regardless of whether we are ultimately successful  could adversely affect our business 
we are currently a party to various legal proceedings 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict how these cases will ultimately be resolved 
we anticipate that the litigation will continue to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful or able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation 
we expense litigation costs as incurred  and only accrue for costs that have been incurred but not paid to the vendor as of the financial statement date 
litigation has diverted  and is likely to continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
as a result  until such time as it is resolved  litigation could adversely affect our business 
further  any unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business 
for additional background on this and our other litigation  please see note to the consolidated financial statements in part i and item legal proceedings of this part ii 
product liability claims could be time consuming and costly to defend and could expose us to loss 
our products or our licensees products may have flaws or other defects that may lead to personal or other injury claims 
if products that we or our licensees sell cause personal injury  property injury  financial loss  or other injury to our or our licensees customers  the customers or our licensees may seek damages or other recovery from us 
defending any claims against us  regardless of merit  would be time consuming  expensive to defend  and distracting to management  and could result in damages and injure our reputation  the reputation of our technology and services  and or the reputation of our products  or the reputation of our licensees or their products 
this damage could limit the market for our and our licensees products and harm our results of operations 
in addition  if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in the past  manufacturers of peripheral products including certain gaming products such as joysticks  wheels  or gamepads  have been subject to claims alleging that use of their products has caused or contributed to various types of repetitive stress injuries  including carpal tunnel syndrome 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  we could face such claims in the future  which could harm our business and reputation 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions 
our products are complex and may contain undetected errors  which could harm our reputation and future product sales 
any failure to provide high quality and reliable products  whether caused by our own failure or failures of our suppliers or oem customers  could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our products 
our products have in the past contained  and may in the future contain  undetected errors or defects 
some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been shipped to customers 
any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in loss of revenue  loss of customers  and increased service and warranty costs  any of which could adversely affect our business 
the nature of some of our products may also subject us to export control regulation by the us department of state and the department of commerce 
violations of these regulations can result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
our sales to customers in some areas outside the united states could be subject to government export regulations or restrictions that prohibit us from selling to customers in some countries or that require us to obtain licenses or approvals to export such products internationally 
delays or denial of the grant of any required license or approval  or changes to the regulations  could make it difficult or impossible to make sales to foreign customers in some countries and could adversely affect our revenue 
in addition  we could be subject to fines and penalties for violation of these export regulations if we were found in violation 
such violation could result in penalties  including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries  and could materially and adversely affect our business 

table of contents compliance with directives that restrict the use of certain materials may increase our costs and limit our revenue opportunities 
our products and packaging must meet all safety  electrical  labeling  marking  or other requirements of the countries into which we ship products or our resellers sell our products 
we have to assess each product and determine whether it complies with the requirements of local regulations or whether they are exempt from meeting the requirements of the regulations 
if we determine that a product is not exempt and does not comply with adopted regulations  we will have to make changes to the product or its documentation if we want to sell that product into the region once the regulations become effective 
making such changes may be costly to perform and may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the national enforcement bodies of the regions adopting such regulations will agree with our assessment that certain of our products and documentation comply with or are exempt from the regulations 
if products are determined not to be compliant or exempt  we will not be able to ship them in the region that adopts such regulations until such time that they are compliant  and this may have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
because personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies currently work with microsoft s operating system software  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline if microsoft modifies its operating system software 
our hardware and software technologies for personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies are currently compatible with microsoft s windows  windows me  windows xp  and windows vista operating systems  including directx  microsoft s entertainment api 
modifications and new versions of microsoft s operating system and apis including directx and windows may require that we and or our licensees modify the touch enabling technologies to be compatible with microsoft s modifications or new versions  and this could cause delays in the release of products by our licensees 
if microsoft modifies its software products in ways that limit the use of our other licensees products  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline 
in addition  microsoft announced that its new product  windows  will feature a new multi touch input function  allowing users to use multiple fingers simultaneously to interact with touch surfaces 
enabling multi location touch feedback will require us to innovate hardware and software  enable windows api s with multi touch output support  and work with our licensees and third parties to integrate such features 
there are feasibility risks with both hardware and software  and there may be potential delays in the revenue growth of haptically enabled multi touch surfaces 
if we are unable to develop open source compliant products  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
we have seen  and believe that we will continue to see  an increase in customers requesting that we develop products that will operate in an open source environment 
developing open source compliant products  without imperiling the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends  may prove difficult under certain circumstances  thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage for new product designs 
as a result  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
the market for certain touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products is at an early stage and if market demand does not develop  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
the market for certain of our touch enabling technologies and certain of our licensees touch enabled products is at an early stage 
if we and our licensees are unable to develop demand for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
we cannot accurately predict the growth of the markets for these technologies and products  the timing of product introductions  or the timing of commercial acceptance of these products 
even if our touch enabling technologies and our licensees touch enabled products are ultimately widely adopted  widespread adoption may take a long time to occur 
the timing and amount of royalties and product sales 
table of contents that we receive will depend on whether the products marketed achieve widespread adoption and  if so  how rapidly that adoption occurs 
we expect that we will need to pursue extensive and expensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective licensees  component customers  and end users about the uses and benefits of our technologies and to persuade software developers to create software that utilizes our technologies 
negative product reviews or publicity about our company  our products  our licensees products  haptic features  or haptic technology in general could have a negative impact on market adoption  our revenue  and or our ability to license our technologies in the future 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to license our technologies and generate revenues would be impaired 
our business depends on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property rights and by selling products that incorporate our technologies 
we rely on our significant patent portfolio to protect our proprietary rights 
if we are not able to protect and enforce those rights  our ability to obtain future licenses or maintain current licenses and royalty revenue could be impaired 
in addition  if a court or the patent office were to limit the scope  declare unenforceable  or invalidate any of our patents  current licensees may refuse to make royalty payments  or they may choose to challenge one or more of our patents 
it is also possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we or our licensees do business 
we also rely on licenses  confidentiality agreements  other contractual agreements  and copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  and policing unauthorized use of our patented technologies  trademarks  and other proprietary rights would be difficult  expensive  and time consuming  within and particularly outside of the united states of america 
certain terms or rights granted in our license agreements or our development contracts may limit our future revenue opportunities 
while it is not our general practice to sign license agreements that provide exclusive rights for a period of time with respect to a technology  field of use  and or geography  or to accept similar limitations in product development contracts  we have entered into such agreements and may in the future 
although additional compensation or other benefits may be part of the agreement  the compensation or benefits may not adequately compensate us for the limitations or restrictions we have agreed to as that particular market develops 
over the life of the exclusivity period  especially in markets that grow larger or faster than anticipated  our revenue may be limited and less than what we could have achieved in the market with several licensees or additional products available to sell to a specific set of customers 
if we fail to develop new or enhanced technologies for new applications and platforms  we may not be able to create a market for our technologies or our technologies may become obsolete  and our ability to grow and our results of operations might be harmed 
our initiatives to develop new and enhanced technologies and to commercialize these technologies for new applications and new platforms may not be successful or timely 
any new or enhanced technologies may not be favorably received by consumers and could damage our reputation or our brand 
expanding our technologies could also require significant additional expenses and strain our management  financial  and operational resources 

table of contents moreover  technology products generally have relatively short product life cycles and our current products may become obsolete in the future 
our ability to generate revenues will be harmed if we fail to develop new technologies or products  the technologies we develop infringe on third party patents or other third party rights  our new technologies fail to gain market acceptance  or our current products become obsolete or no longer meet new regulatory requirements 
our ability to achieve revenue growth also depends on our continuing ability to improve and reduce the cost of our technologies and to introduce these technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products and our revenue growth may be impaired 
we have limited engineering  customer service  technical support  quality assurance and manufacturing resources to design and fulfill favorable product delivery schedules and sufficient levels of quality in support of our different product areas 
products and services may not be delivered in a timely way  with sufficient levels of quality  or at all  which may reduce our revenue 
engineering  customer service  technical support  quality assurance  and manufacturing resources are deployed against a variety of different projects and programs to provide sufficient levels of quality necessary for channels and customers 
success in various markets may depend on timely deliveries and overall levels of sustained quality and customer service 
failure to provide favorable product and program deliverables and quality and customer service levels  or provide them at all  may disrupt channels and customers  harm our brand  and reduce our revenues 
the higher cost of products incorporating our touch enabling technologies may inhibit or prevent their widespread adoption 
personal computer and console gaming peripherals  mobile devices  touchscreens  and automotive and industrial controls incorporating our touch enabling technologies can be more expensive than similar competitive products that are not touch enabled 
although major manufacturers  such as alps electric co  bmw  lg electronics  logitech  microsoft  nokia  samsung  and sony have licensed our technologies  the greater expense of development and production of products containing our touch enabling technologies  together with the higher price to the end customer  may be a significant barrier to their widespread adoption and sale 
third party validation studies may not demonstrate all the benefits of our medical training simulators  which could affect customer motivation to buy 
in medical training  validation studies are generally used to confirm the usefulness of new techniques  devices  and training methods 
for medical training simulators  several levels of validation are generally tested content  concurrent  construct  and predictive 
a validation study performed by a third party  such as a hospital  a teaching institution  or even an individual healthcare professional  could result in showing little or no benefit for one or more types of validation for our medical training simulators 
such validation study results published in medical journals could impact the willingness of customers to buy our training simulators  especially new simulators that have not previously been validated 
in addition  customers may be reluctant to purchase these products if no studies have been published or until a favorable study has been published  which would negatively impact our revenues from sales of these products 

table of contents medical licensing and certification authorities may not recommend or require use of our technologies for training and or testing purposes and certain legislation that may encourage the use of simulators may not become law  significantly slowing or inhibiting the market penetration of our medical simulation technologies 
several key medical certification bodies  including the american board of internal medicine abim  the american board of surgery abs  and the american college of cardiology acc  have great influence in recommending particular medical methodologies  including medical training and testing methodologies  for use by medical professionals 
in the event that the abim and the acc  as well as other  similar bodies  do not endorse medical simulation products in general  or our products in particular  as a training and or testing tool  and in addition in the event that the enhancing simulation act of does not pass into law  market penetration for our products in the medical market could be significantly and adversely affected 
we have limited distribution channels and resources to market and sell our products  and if we are unsuccessful in marketing and selling these products  we may not achieve or sustain product revenue growth 
we have limited resources for marketing and selling our products  either directly or through distributors 
to achieve our business objectives  we must build a balanced mixture of sales through a direct sales channel and through qualified distribution channels 
the success of our efforts to sell products will depend upon our ability to retain and develop a qualified sales force and effective distribution channels 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to sell and market our products 
a number of our distributors are small  specialized companies and may not have sufficient capital or human resources to support the complexities of selling and supporting our products 
in addition  many of our distributors do not have exclusive relationships with us and may not devote sufficient time and attention to selling our products 
there can be no assurance that our direct selling efforts will be effective  distributors or oems will market our products successfully or  if our relationships with distributors or oems terminate  that we will be able to establish relationships with other distributors or oems on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any disruption in the distribution  sales  or marketing network for our products could have a material adverse effect on our product revenues 
it is difficult for us to predict the sales volume of our distribution channels  which makes it difficult for us to forecast our business 
the sales volumes for our limited distribution channels are volatile and hard to predict 
we consider forecasts in determining our component needs and our inventory requirements 
if the business in these limited distribution channels fails to meet expectations  or if we fail to accurately forecast our customers product demands  we may have inadequate or excess inventory of our products or components or assets that are not realizable  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the markets in which we participate or may target in the future are intensely competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
our target markets are rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition  much longer operating histories  larger marketing budgets  and significantly greater resources than we do  and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants  we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we believe that competition in these markets will continue to be intense and that competitive pressures will drive the price of our products and our licensees products downward 
these price reductions  if not offset by increases in unit sales or productivity  will cause our revenues to decline 
if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
some of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price  which has resulted in pricing pressures 
if we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels  our operating results would be negatively impacted 
in addition  pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales  reduced margins  losses  or the failure of our application suite to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance  any of which could harm our business 
in the medical simulation market  we face competition from simbionix usa corporation  mentice corporation  medical education technologies  inc  and medical simulation corporation 
in the mobility and 
table of contents touchscreen markets  we face competition from internal design teams of existing and potential oem customers 
as a result of their licenses to our patent portfolios  we could face competition from microsoft and sony 
our licensees or other third parties may also seek to develop products using our intellectual property or develop alternative designs that attempt to circumvent our intellectual property or that they believe do not require a license under our intellectual property 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do  and the costs associated with asserting our intellectual property rights against such products and such potential competitors could be significant 
moreover  if such alternative designs were determined by a court not to require a license under our intellectual property rights  competition from such unlicensed products could limit or reduce our revenues 
additionally  if haptic technology gains market acceptance  more research by universities and or corporations or other parties may be performed potentially leading to strong intellectual property positions by third parties in certain areas of haptics or the launch of haptics products before we commercialize our own technology 
many of our current and potential competitors  including microsoft  are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products and services 
in addition  many of our competitors have established marketing relationships or access to larger customer bases  distributors  and other business partners 
as a result  our competitors might be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
further  some potential customers  particularly large enterprises  may elect to develop their own internal solutions 
for all of these reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
winning business is subject to a competitive selection process that can be lengthy and requires us to incur significant expense  and we may not be selected 
our primary focus is on winning competitive bid selection processes  known as design wins  so that haptics will be included in our customers equipment 
these selection processes can be lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures 
we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures 
because we typically focus on only a few customers in a product area  the loss of a design win can sometimes result in our failure to get haptics added to new generation products 
this can result in lost sales and could hurt our position in future competitive selection processes because we may not be perceived as being a technology leader 
after winning a product design for one of our customers  we may still experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development and design cycle 
in addition  a delay or cancellation of a customer s plans could significantly adversely affect our financial results  as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue 
finally  if our customers fail to successfully market and sell their equipment it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations as the demand for our products falls 
automobiles incorporating our touch enabling technologies are subject to lengthy product development periods  making it difficult to predict when and whether we will receive automotive royalties 
the product development process for automobiles is very lengthy  sometimes longer than four years 
we may not earn royalty revenue on our automotive technologies unless and until automobiles featuring our technologies are shipped to customers  which may not occur until several years after we enter into an agreement with an automobile manufacturer or a supplier to an automobile manufacturer 
throughout the product development process  we face the risk that an automobile manufacturer or supplier may delay the incorporation of  or choose not to incorporate  our technologies into its automobiles  making it difficult for us to predict the automotive royalties we may receive  if any 
after the product launches  our royalties still depend on market acceptance of the vehicle or the option packages if our technology is an option for example  a navigation unit  which is likely to be determined by many factors beyond our control 

table of contents we have experienced significant change in our business  and we cannot assure you that these changes will result in increased revenue or profitability 
our business has undergone significant changes in recent periods  including the proposed divestiture of our d business  new management  consolidation of our touch  gaming  and mobility businesses and personnel changes and focus on additional target markets 
these changes have required significant investments of cash and other resources  as well as management s time and attention and have placed significant strains on our managerial  financial  engineering  or other resources 
we cannot assure you that these efforts will result in growing our business successfully or in increased operating performance 
our international expansion efforts subject us to additional risks and costs 
we intend to expand international activities 
international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  foreign exchange and currency risks  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable or longer payment cycles  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties and expense in enforcing intellectual property rights  business risks  including fluctuations in demand for our products and the cost and effort to conduct international operations and travel abroad to promote international distribution and overall global economic conditions  multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  and political and economic instability 
our international operations could also increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls  or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 
clent richardson  our chief executive officer  and other members of our executive management team are relatively new and if there are difficulties with this leadership transition it could impede the execution of our business strategy 
clent richardson  our chief executive officer  was hired in april  and other members of our executive management team also joined us in our success will depend to a significant extent on their ability to implement a successful strategy  to successfully lead and motivate our employees  and to work effectively with other members of our executive management team and board of directors 
if this leadership transition is not successful  our ability to execute our business strategy would be impeded 
we might be unable to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could slow the development and deployment of our technologies 
our ability to develop and deploy our technologies and to sustain our revenue growth depends upon the continued service of our management and other key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
management and other key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short 
table of contents notice 
the loss of management or key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend largely on our ability to attract  integrate  and retain sales  support  marketing  and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating  and retaining such personnel 
given the protracted nature of if  how  and when we collect royalties on new design contracts  it may be difficult to craft compensation plans that will attract and retain the level of salesmanship needed to secure these contracts 
our stock option and award program is a long term retention program that is intended to attract  retain  and provide incentives for talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
additionally some of our executive officers and key employees hold stock options with exercise prices above the current market price of our common stock 
each of these factors may impair our ability to retain the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our technologies are complex and we rely upon the continued service of our existing personnel to support licensees  enhance existing technologies  and develop new technologies 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  earthquake  power outage  or terrorist activity 
a substantial portion of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in san jose  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
an earthquake at or near our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production and shipments of our products or technologies  and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while we believe that we maintain insurance sufficient to cover most long term potential losses at our facilities  our existing insurance may not be adequate for all possible losses 
in addition  california has experienced problems with its power supply in recent years 
as a result  we have experienced utility cost increases and may experience unexpected interruptions in our power supply that could have a material adverse effect on our sales  results of operations  and financial condition 
investment risks our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
these factors include the establishment or loss of licensing relationships  the timing and recognition of payments under fixed and or up front license agreements  the timing of work performed under development agreements  the timing of our expenses  including costs related to litigation  stock based awards  acquisitions of technologies  or businesses  the timing of introductions and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us  our licensees  our competitors  or their competitors  our ability to develop and improve our technologies  our ability to attract  integrate  and retain qualified personnel  seasonality in the demand for our products or our licensees products  and our ability to build or ship products on a timely basis 

table of contents our stock price may fluctuate regardless of our performance 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  announcements regarding litigation in which we are involved  changes by game console manufacturers to not include touch enabling capabilities in their products  new products or new contracts  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of large number of shares of our common stock by insiders or others  stock repurchase activity  changes in securities analysts recommendations  changing circumstances regarding competitors or their customers  governmental regulatory action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  inclusion in or exclusion from various stock indices  and general market conditions 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has been initiated against that company 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  which could reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our board of directors or management  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three year terms  only our chairperson of the board of directors  a majority of our board of directors or or greater stockholders are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders  our stockholders can only take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent  vacancies on our board of directors can be filled only by our board of directors and not by our stockholders  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  and advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law may discourage  delay  or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares 
we may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders interests  divert management attention  or cause integration problems 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past and may in the future  acquire businesses or intellectual property that we feel could complement our business  enhance our technical capabilities  or increase our intellectual property portfolio 
the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying  investigating  and pursuing suitable acquisitions  whether or not they are consummated 
if we consummate acquisitions through the issuance of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
acquisitions could also create risks for us  including unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions  use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel or operations  failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquired intellectual property or other assets  
table of contents charges associated with amortization of acquired assets or potential charges for write down of assets associated with unsuccessful acquisitions  potential intellectual property infringement claims related to newly acquired product lines  and potential costs associated with failed acquisition efforts 
any acquisitions  even if successfully completed  might not generate significant additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires  among other things  that we establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to report on our internal control over financing reporting 
our and our auditor s testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective 
we have incurred  and we expect to continue to incur  substantial accounting and auditing expense and expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of section if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by the sec  the nasdaq stock market  or nasdaq  or other regulatory authorities  or become subject to litigation 
to the extent any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future  we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct such material weaknesses or to respond to any resulting regulatory investigations or proceedings 
we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting is currently ineffective 
as discussed in part ii  item a  controls and procedures  our management team  under the supervision and with the participation of our chief financial officer and current chief executive officer  conducted an evaluation of our internal controls as of december  management concluded that we had a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting related to income taxes 
we have subsequently initiated actions that are intended to improve our accounting for income taxes and the related internal controls 
due to the continuing presence of this material weakness and the ongoing implementation of remedial actions for this material weakness as of december   management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  any continuation of this material weakness in our internal controls over the accounting for income taxes could impair our ability to report our financial position and results of operations accurately and in a timely manner 
as our business grows  such growth may place a significant strain on our management and operations and  as a result  our business may suffer 
we plan to continue expanding our business  and any significant growth could place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and other resources 
we recently transitioned the preparation of all of our internal reporting to upgraded management information systems and are in the process of implementing this system for all of our subsidiaries 
if we encounter problems with the implementation of these systems  we may have difficulties preparing or tracking internal information  which could adversely affect our financial results 
we will need to continue to invest the necessary capital to upgrade and improve our operational  financial and management reporting systems 
if our management fails to manage our growth effectively  we could experience increased costs  declines in product quality  or customer satisfaction  which could harm our business

this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are identified by words such as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  may  will  and other similar expressions 
however  these words are not the only way we identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements  which refer to expectations  projections  or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in item a  risk factors  those described elsewhere in this report  and those described in our other reports filed with the sec 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report  and we undertake no obligation to release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that could occur after the filing of this report 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  bad debts  inventory reserves  short term investments  warranty obligations  patents and intangible assets  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
we derive our revenues from three principal sources royalty and license fees  product sales  and development contracts 
royalty and license revenue we recognize royalty and license revenue based on royalty reports or related information received from the licensee as well as time based licenses of our intellectual property portfolio 
up front payments under license agreements are deferred and recognized as revenue either based on the royalty reports received or amortized over the license period depending on the nature of the agreement 
advance payments under license agreements that also require us to provide future services to the licensee are deferred and recognized over the service period when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe related to the value of the services does not exist 
we generally recognize revenue from our licensees under one or a combination of the following license models license revenue model revenue recognition perpetual license of intellectual property portfolio based on per unit royalties  no services contracted 
based on royalty reports received from licensees 
no further obligations to licensee exist 
time based license of intellectual property portfolio with up front payments and or annual minimum royalty requirements  no services contracted

 sop  and sop  as amended  to guide the accounting treatment for each individual contract 
see also the discussions regarding multiple element arrangements below 
if the information received from our licensees regarding royalties is incorrect or inaccurate  our revenues in future periods may be adversely affected 
to date  none of the information we have received from our licensees has caused any material reduction in future period revenues 
product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when the product is shipped  provided the other revenue recognition criteria are met  including that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligation remains 
we sell our products with warranties ranging from three to sixty months 
we record the estimated warranty costs during the quarter the revenue is recognized 
historically  warranty related costs and related accruals have not been significant 
we offer a general right of return on the microscribe product line for days after purchase 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of a microscribe digitizer and provide an accrual for potential returns based on historical experience 
we offer no other general right of return on our products 
development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue is comprised of professional services consulting services and or development contracts  customer support  and extended warranty contracts 
development contract revenues are recognized under the cost to cost percentage of completion accounting method based on physical completion of the work to be performed or completed contract method 
losses on contracts are recognized when determined 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the conditions become known 
customer support and extended warranty contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
multiple element arrangements we enter into revenue arrangements in which the customer purchases a combination of patent  technology  and or software licenses  products  professional services  support  and extended warranties multiple element arrangements 
when vsoe of fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value do not exist  the revenue is generally recorded over the term of the contract 
our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in greater or future operating losses 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payment sfas no 
r 
we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
valuation and amortization method we use the black scholes model  single option approach to determine the fair value of stock options  and espp shares 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors which impact the expected term and forfeiture rates  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 

table of contents expected term we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we used the simplified method as prescribed by sab no 
for options granted prior to january  expected volatility we estimate the volatility of our common stock taking into consideration our historical stock price movement  the volatility of stock prices of companies of similar size with similar businesses  if any  and our expected future stock price trends based on known or anticipated events 
risk free interest rate we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
expected dividend we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
forfeitures we are required to estimate future forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating results 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and espp shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire and be worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values

r disclosures 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized and are reversed at such time that realization is believed to be more likely than not 
management must make assumptions  judgments  and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions  and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render inaccurate our current assumptions  judgments  and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
any of the assumptions  judgments  and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
litigation settlements  conclusions  and patent license in march  we announced the conclusion of our patent infringement litigation against sony computer entertainment at the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
sony computer entertainment satisfied the us district court for the northern district of california judgment against it 
as of march   we entered into a new business agreement with sony computer entertainment 
we determined that the conclusion of our litigation with sony computer entertainment did not trigger any payment obligations under our microsoft agreements 
however  on june   microsoft filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the western district of washington alleging breach of our sublicense agreement dated july  and seeked damages  specific performance  declaratory judgment  and attorneys fees and costs 
at a court ordered mediation meeting on december   microsoft indicated they believe the amount owed to be million 
on august   the parties agreed to settle microsoft s breach of contract claim as well as our counterclaim 
the settlement arrangement provided that we pay microsoft million  which we paid in october  and the case was dismissed 
short term investments our short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid commercial paper and government agency securities purchased with an original or remaining maturity of greater than days on the date of purchase 
we classify all debt securities with readily determinable market values as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
even though the stated maturity dates of these debt securities may be one year or more beyond the balance sheet date  we have classified all debt securities as short term investments in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter a  working capital current assets and current liabilities  as they are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold during our normal operating cycle 
these investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses considered to be temporary in nature reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
we follow the guidance provided by financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp and eitf no 
the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments to assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statement of operations 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
sfas no 
also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available 
assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for 
table of contents identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas no 
are described below level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices in markets that are less active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  level prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
in february  the financial fasb issued fsp no 
that delays the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until fiscal years beginning after november  the delay is intended to allow the fasb and constituents additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas no 
we continue to assess the impact that fsp may have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
further information about the application of sfas no 
may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recovery of accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
to date such estimated losses have been within our expectations 
inventory reserves we reduce our inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product return and warranty reserves we provide for estimated costs of future anticipated product returns and warranty obligations based on historical experience when related revenues are recognized  and we defer warranty related revenue over the related warranty term 
intangible assets we have acquired patents and other intangible assets 
in addition  we capitalize the external legal and filing fees associated with patents and trademarks 
we assess the recoverability of our intangible assets  and we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we amortize our intangible assets related to patents and trademarks  once they issue  over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
future changes in the estimated useful life could affect the amount of future period amortization expense that we will incur 
during  we capitalized costs associated with patents and trademarks of million 
our total amortization expense for the same period for all intangible assets was 
table of contents restructuring costs we calculate our restructuring costs based upon our estimate of workforce reduction costs  asset impairment charges  and other appropriate charges resulting from a restructuring 
the company accounts for restructuring costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities based on our assumptions  judgments  and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations overview of during  we achieved several milestones  including continued growth in revenues 
we continued to invest in research  development  sales  and marketing across all our key business segments 
key events in the year were as follows revenue growth of in over  and royalty and license revenue growth of in over we continued to have strong growth of mobility revenues as shown by the increase in over we announced the divestiture of our d product line  which we expect to complete in in august  we settled our litigation with microsoft and we agreed to make a one time payment to microsoft in the amount of million  which was recorded in the third quarter of and paid in october with our planned divestiture of the d product line we hope to achieve cost reductions that can positively impact our future financial results 
with our plan to move the medical operating segment to san jose  we hope to achieve additional cost reductions in in  we expect to continue to focus on the execution of plans in our established businesses to increase revenue and make selected investments for product based solutions for longer term growth areas 
our success could be limited by several factors  including the current macro economic climate  the timely release of our new products and our licensees products  continued market acceptance of our products and technology  the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors  and the cost of ongoing litigation

royalty and license revenue increased by million or from to and was all from our touch segment 
the increase in royalty and license revenue was primarily a result of an increase in mobile device license and royalty revenue of million and an increase in gaming royalties of million  offset in part by a decrease in royalties for touch interface products of  mobile device license and royalty revenue increased primarily due to the increase in the shipment of touchsense enabled phones by lg electronics that began in the second quarter of  the signing of a new license contract with mobile device manufacturer nokia at the end of the second quarter of  and the shipment of additional touchsense enabled phones by our licensees in 
table of contents the increase in gaming royalties compared to was mainly due to previously deferred royalty revenues from isllc totaling million which was recognized after we concluded our litigation with them 
there was also an increase in royalty and license revenue from an increase in sales of new steering wheel products from logitech 
in addition  there was a full year of royalty and license revenue from first party gaming licensee sony computer entertainment that increased revenue year over year 
although the revenue from our third party peripheral licensees has generally continued to decline primarily due to i the reduced sales of past generation video console systems due to the launches of the next generation console models from microsoft xbox  sony playstation  and nintendo wii  and ii the decline in third party market share of aftermarket game console controllers due to the launch of next generation peripherals by manufacturers of console systems  we are seeing the decline begin to stabilize  as manifested by the release of new steering wheel products from logitech for the playstation sony announced on may  that the vibration feature that is currently available on playstation ps and playstation ps console systems would be removed from the new playstation ps console system 
the ps console system was launched in late in the united states and japan without native vibration or any force feedback capability of any kind 
in the first quarter of  sony released an update to the ps console system that offered limited vibration and force feedback support for some older ps and ps games and controllers 
in september  sony announced that it would fully restore vibration feedback features for the ps console system 
the new ps dualshock controllers with vibration feedback were released in japan in november as standalone products sold separately from the ps console system 
in april  sony released the ps dualshock controller in the us and released a version in europe in july of while a very limited number of third party ps vibration and force feedback products have been announced recently  including various steering wheel models from logitech  we do not know to what extent sony will foster the market for other third party ps gaming peripherals with vibration feedback 
to the extent sony discourages or impedes third party controller makers from making more ps controllers with vibration feedback  our licensing revenue from third party ps peripherals will continue to be severely limited 
based on our litigation conclusion and new business agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment in march see note to the consolidated financial statements for more discussion  we will recognize a minimum of million as royalty and license revenue from march through march  approximately  per quarter 
for the microsoft xbox video console system launched in november  microsoft has  to date  not broadly licensed third parties to produce game controllers 
because our gaming royalties come mainly from third party manufacturers  unless microsoft broadens its licenses to third party controller makers  particularly with respect to wireless controllers for xbox  our gaming royalty revenue may decline 
additionally  microsoft is now making touch enabled wheels covered by its royalty free  perpetual  irrevocable license to our worldwide portfolio of patents that could compete with our licensees current or future products for which we earn per unit royalties 
for the nintendo wii video console system launched in december  nintendo has  to date  not yet broadly licensed third parties to produce game controllers for its wii game console 
because our gaming royalties come mainly from third party manufacturers  unless nintendo broadens its licenses to third party controller makers  our gaming royalty revenue may decline 
touch interface product royalties decreased mainly due to the recognition of certain automotive royalty payments in the second quarter of that did not recur 
in addition  bmw has begun to remove our technology from certain controller systems  that also caused automotive royalties to decline 
we expect that this removal of our technology from certain controller systems will cause our automotive royalty revenue to decline in the future  which may be partially offset by new vehicles from other manufactures brought to market 
product sales product sales increased by  or from to the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased medical product sales of  mainly due to increased sales of our endoscopy  laparoscopy  and arthroscopy simulator platforms partially offset by decreases in our endovascular simulators and a slight decrease in our virtual iv simulators 
these increases were primarily due to continued expansion of international sales for all of our simulation platforms including increased sales of laparoscopy simulators driven by our increased emphasis on the laparoscopy platform and modules as well as the launch of an arthroscopy simulator in the first half of touch interface products increased by  due to additional sales of touchscreen and touch panel components  rotary modules  and arcade entertainment products 
d product sales increased by  due to additional sales of our microscribe  cybergrasp  cyberglove  and cybertouch products 

table of contents development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue decreased by million or from to development contracts and other revenue is comprised of revenue on commercial and government contracts 
the decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in medical contract revenue of million due to the completion of work performed under medical contracts that occurred in through the first six months of  and decreased touch interface product contract revenue of  primarily due to contracts being completed during the year 
partially offsetting this  there was increased revenue recognized on mobile device development contracts and support of  we do not currently have any government projects in development 
we continue to transition our engineering resources from certain commercial development contract efforts to product development efforts that focus on leveraging our existing sales and channel distribution capabilities 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue our total revenue for the year ended december  increased by million or to million  from million in royalty and license revenue royalty and license revenue increased by million or from to the increase in royalty and license revenue was primarily a result of an increase in gaming royalties of million  an increase in mobile device license and royalty revenue of million  and an increase in touch interface product royalties of million  offset in part by a decrease in medical license fees of  the increase in gaming royalties compared to was mainly due to new royalty and license revenue from first party gaming licensee sony computer entertainment 
during  we recognized million of revenue from sony computer entertainment 
sony computer entertainment became a licensee in march  and accordingly there was no license revenue from sony computer entertainment in the prior year comparative period 
in addition  revenues from our third party peripheral licensees generally continued to decline primarily due to reduced sales of past generation video console systems and the significant decline in third party market share of aftermarket game console controllers 
mobile device license and royalty revenue increased due to the shipment of more touchsense enabled phones by samsung and lg electronics  and the signing of a new license contract with mobile device manufacturer nokia at the end of the second quarter of touch interface product royalties increased due to increased licensee revenue from additional products licensed in the automotive market and the recognition of certain one time royalty payments in the second quarter of the decrease in medical royalty and license revenue was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue from our license and development agreements with medtronic 
product sales product sales increased by million or from to the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased medical product sales of million  mainly due to increased sales of our endoscopy and virtual iv simulator platforms 
this increase in product sales was a result of pursuing a product growth strategy for our medical business  which includes leveraging our industry alliances  resulting in significant increases in the sales of our virtual iv platform and expanding international sales  resulting in additional increases in revenue from our endoscopy platform 
sales of our touch interface products increased by  including increased sales of touchscreen and touch panel components  force feedback electronics for arcade gaming  and rotary modules 
the increase in touch interface products is attributable to the successful introduction of a customers product in which our arcade gaming boards are used as well as increased shipments of our rotary modules as a result of design wins 
development contracts and other revenue development contracts and other revenue increased by  or from to commercial contract revenue increased by million due to increased medical contract revenue primarily from medtronic for four new development contracts completed in  increased contract revenue from the completion of one mobile device development contract  and increased revenue from new and continuing mobile device development contracts  partially offset by a decrease in touch interface product contract revenue

accordingly  the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate 
for the year ended  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million yielding an effective tax rate of 
the tax provision is primarily reflective of federal and state tax expense as a result of our pre tax income of million mainly due to the litigation conclusions and patent license from sony computer entertainment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the significant reduction in our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as we used the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards against current year taxable income 
for the year ended  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  yielding an effective tax rate of

we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
we will continue to protect and defend our extensive intellectual property portfolio across all business segments 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for the year ended december  will total approximately million in connection with anticipated maintenance and upgrades to operations and infrastructure 
additionally  if we acquire one or more businesses  patents  or products  our cash or capital requirements could increase substantially 
in the event of such an acquisition  or should any unanticipated circumstances arise that significantly increase our capital requirements  we may elect to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing 
any of these events could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
although we expect to be able to raise additional capital if necessary  there is no assurance that such additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  and and contractual obligations total operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaling  including interest of  of which approximately  could be payable in cash 
due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
settlement of such amounts could require the utilization of working capital 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in these factors may cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage the exposure to these market risks as follows cash equivalents and short term investments we have cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolios 
the primary objective of our policies is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to months 
our policy s guidelines also limit exposure to loss by limiting the sums we can invest in any individual security and restricting investment to securities that meet certain defined credit ratings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rates a substantial majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do incur certain operating costs for our foreign operations in other currencies but these operations are limited in scope and thus we are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally we have some reliance on international and export sales that are subject to the risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because a substantial majority of our international and export revenues  as well as expenses  are typically denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts  or other foreign currency hedging arrangements
