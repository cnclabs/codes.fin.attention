critical accounting policies and significant estimates our critical accounting policies and significant estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition and allowance for returns revenue is recognized when products are shipped  the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the allowances for returns as of may  and were approximately  and   respectively 
these allowances are recorded at the time of revenue recognition  if the right of return exists  and are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable 
this allowance is estimated by management based on our historical rate of returns 
we recognize shipping and handling revenues as part of revenue  and shipping and handling expenses as part of cost of revenue on the statements of operations 
subscription based revenue on our measuring up e path products is recognized prorata over the life of the agreement 
deferred prepublication costs deferred prepublication costs are recorded at their original cost and amortized over a three or five year period  based on the estimated lives of the related publications 
the net carrying value of the deferred prepublication costs is periodically reviewed and compared to an estimate of future net undiscounted cash flows 
as of may   the valuation allowance as compared to last year remained unchanged at  if future net undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to realize the net carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge will be recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit to our customers is determined on a customer by customer basis 
trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for the doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts after reviewing individual customer accounts as well as considering both historical and expected credit loss experience 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at both may  and and is believed to be adequate for any exposure to loss 
allowance for excess and slow moving inventory we continuously monitor our inventory on hand for salability 
this monitoring includes review of historical sales experience  projected sales activity by title  and any planned changes to a title that are known by us 
any slow moving or non salable inventory identified is reserved or written down at that time 
the reserves of approximately  and  at may  and are believed to be adequate to cover inventory loss exposure 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of may   a valuation allowances has been provided in the amount of  related to the tax benefit of our available federal and state net operating losses nols 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future 
we perform a comprehensive tax review quarterly and if future levels of taxable income are not sufficient or fail to materialize in the near term  management will adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
year ended may  vs 
year ended may  overview in fiscal  we had a net loss of million per share compared to a net loss of million per share in the prior year 
net revenue declined by approximately on a year over year basis due principally to an overall decline in educational spending

we had a net loss before income taxes of million compared to loss of million in the prior year 
we had an income tax expense of million  which includes a million deferred tax valuation allowance  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the prior year 
these items are discussed in more detail below 
net revenue in thousands year ended variance variance test preparation  assessment and instruction college preparation literacy not applicable total net revenue test preparation  assessment  and instruction revenue for this product group was million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  representing a decrease of 
testing and assessment revenue was million  a decrease of compared to the prior year  while instruction revenue was million  down from the prior year 
the product group s overall decrease was due in part to an overall decline in supplemental education spending for the past year 
according to association of american publishers  the supplemental education market for the twelve months ended may  was down approximately from the prior year 
in spite of current economic challenges  we are optimistic about the opportunities for growth in this market niche and we will continue to invest in new proprietary product development for this product group 
college preparation revenue for this product group was million  a decrease of from the prior year 
distribution revenue  which accounts for approximately of the total revenue within this group  was down primarily due to the effects of decreased spending due to school budget cuts 
revenue from our proprietary products increased  compared to the prior year due to an aggressive sales and marketing plan in which we distinguished ourselves in the market with unique skills based supplements 
we will continue to invest in new proprietary product development as we are optimistic about the opportunities for growth in this market niche 
literacy revenue for this product group  which was started in march  was  for the year 
we feel that these new products allow us to enter a market niche for which previously we did not have a product offering 
we anticipate growing the number of products within this group through additional distribution agreements and in house development 
cost of revenue cost of revenue for fiscal was s million of revenue compared to million of revenue in the prior year 
cost of revenue consists of two components direct costs and prepublication cost amortization 
direct costs consist of product cost  which includes paper  printing  binding  and prepress costs for proprietary products and product purchases for nonproprietary products  royalties  and warehousing and shipping costs for all products 
direct costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal were  an increase from in the prior year 
the percentage increase is primarily due to revenue mix  as college preparation revenue increased from of total revenue in fiscal to in fiscal college preparation direct costs are substantially higher than the direct cost of testing  assessment and instruction  as the majority of college preparation revenue consists of nonproprietary products 
prepublication costs include one time expenses associated with developing and producing new or revised proprietary products 
it includes all editorial expenses  writing  page design and makeup  art and other permissions  prepress  and any other costs incurred up to the print bind stage of the books 
these prepublication costs also include expenses incurred for other forms of product development 
prepublication costs are capitalized and expensed on a straight line basis over a three or five year period  based upon the product 
we believe our amortization policy is in line with industry practice 
for fiscal  amortization expense was million  compared to million in the prior year 
we expect the fiscal amortization expense to be lower than fiscal  as a result of reduced prepublication expenditures over the last several years

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared to million in the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily provided by our profitability before depreciation and amortization as well as decreases in accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses  offset by a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and by a decrease in deferred revenue 
accounts receivable decreased as a result of the decrease in overall revenues on a year over year basis 
inventory decreased due to our continuing efforts to maintain lower inventory levels  offset by the million of literacy product inventory 
prepaid expenses decreased due to an increase in product sampling 
accounts payable decreased primarily due to the timing of payment to vendors  and lower spending levels  and deferred revenue decreased due to prorata revenue recognition of previously billed subscription based electronic revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million in the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities for consisted primarily of expenditures for prepublication costs of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million in the prior year 
net cash used in financing activities for  consisted primarily of net repayments under our bank agreement for both the line of credit and term loan 
we have a million credit agreement with sovereign bank 
amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the revolving line of credit provides for advances up to million and expires in march the interest rate on the revolving line of credit ranges from libor plus to libor plus  or prime to prime plus  with the exact interest rate based on the ratio of the company s total funded debt to ebitda 
at may   million was outstanding under this facility  and million was available for borrowing 
the term loan was originally for million and matures in december the term loan provides for equal quarterly payments of principal and interest  which began on march  the term loan bears interest at the same rate as the revolving line of credit for million of the million outstanding 
in may  we entered into a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the balance of the term loan for three years at a rate of plus an interest spread of to based upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
after the three year period  the interest rate reverts to a variable rate 
at may   million was outstanding under this agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  calculated on a consolidated basis for the company and its subsidiary  which  among other things  impose a maximum ratio of total funded debt to ebitda and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
these financial covenants restrict the payment of dividends on the company s common stock 
we believe that our cash and borrowing availability under our lines of credit  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our normal cash needs in we intend to continue investing in prepublication costs for our proprietary products at our current spend level 
product development product development expenditures in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
we continue to actively develop new and revised products 
we expect the current level of spending to continue in the future 
product development expenditures in were primarily in the testing  assessment  and instruction product group as we continued to introduce new and revised products within our existing states 
the state test preparation market continues to grow  as the states demand higher academic performance from students 
most states have high stakes testing requirements  which mean that students  teachers  and administrators are rewarded for positive test performance or penalized for poor performance 
the support for state standards and testing has been enhanced considerably by the mandates of the no child left behind federal legislation 
presently  we publish test preparation and assessment products for various grades in twelve states 
we intend to focus our product development in the upcoming year on our core  state specific products 
we intend to enter additional states and continue to supplement existing states with additional products 
we also plan to expand our offering of web based electronic products 
we will continue to produce proprietary college preparation supplements and ancillary materials 
these products will not compete with products we distribute under our existing publisher agreements and will be crafted as supplements to help teachers and students with their college preparation studies 
we do not have plans in the upcoming year to develop new products for our literacy product line  as we intend to grow this product group by offering additional products from the existing publishers with whom we currently have distribution agreements 
our strategic growth plan calls for an emphasis on the internal development of products within the test preparation  assessment and instruction product lines 
under favorable circumstances  we would consider an acquisition to supplement our growth plan 
off balance sheet arrangements none seasonality the supplementary school publishing business is seasonal  cycling around the school year that runs from september through may 
typically  the major marketing campaigns  including mailings of new catalogs and focused sales efforts  begin in september when schools reopen 
this is the period when sample books are provided free of charge for review to teachers for their purchase consideration 
general marketing efforts  including additional sales and marketing campaigns  catalog mailings  and complimentary copies  continue throughout the school year 
teachers and districts generally review and consider books throughout the school year  make their decisions in the winter and spring  and place their purchase requests with the district office or other administrative units at that time 
during spring and summer  these requests are processed and purchase orders are send to publishers
