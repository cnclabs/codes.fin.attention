business overview we design  develop and license chip interface technologies and architectures that are foundational to nearly all digital electronics products 
our chip interface technologies are designed to improve the performance  power efficiency  time to market and cost effectiveness of our customers semiconductor and system products for computing  gaming and graphics  consumer electronics and mobile applications 
as of december   our chip interface technologies are covered by more than us and foreign patents 
additionally  we have approximately patent applications pending 
these patents and patent applications cover important inventions in memory and logic chip interfaces  in addition to other technologies 
we believe that our chip interface technologies provide our customers a means to achieve higher performance  improved power efficiency  lower risk  and greater cost effectiveness in their semiconductor and system products 
our primary method of providing interface technologies to our customers is through our patented innovations 
we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and system companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
patent license agreements are generally royalty bearing 
we also develop a range of solutions including leadership which are rambus proprietary interfaces or architectures widely licensed to our customers and industry standard chip interfaces that we provide to our customers under license for incorporation into their semiconductor and system products 
due to the often complex nature of implementing state of the art chip interface technology  we offer engineering services to our customers to help them successfully integrate our chip interface solutions into their semiconductors and systems 
these technology license agreements may have both a fixed price non recurring component and ongoing royalties 
engineering services are generally offered on a fixed price basis 
further  under technology licenses  our customers may receive licenses to our patents necessary to implement the chip interface in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts with us 
we derive the majority of our annual revenue by licensing our broad portfolio of patents for chip interfaces to our customers 
such licenses may cover part or all of our patent portfolio 
leading semiconductor and system companies such as amd  fujitsu  qimonda  intel  nec  panasonic  renesas  and toshiba have licensed our patents for use in their own products 
we derive additional revenue by licensing our leadership architectures and industry standard chip interfaces to customers for use in their semiconductor and system products 
our customers include leading companies such as elpida  ibm  intel  qimonda  panasonic  sony and toshiba 
due to the complex nature of implementing our technologies  we provide engineering services under certain of these licenses to help our customers successfully 
table of contents integrate our technology solutions into their semiconductors and system products 
additionally  licensees may receive  as an adjunct to their technology license agreements  patent licenses as necessary to implement the technology in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
royalties represent a substantial majority of our total revenue 
the remaining part of our revenue is contract services revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenue or unbilled receivables in any given period 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration  with our top five licensees representing approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenue from fujitsu  nec  panasonic  sony  elpida and amd  each accounted for or more of total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from fujitsu  elpida  qimonda and toshiba  each accounted for or more of total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue from fujitsu  elpida  qimonda and intel  each accounted for or more of total revenue 
our revenue from companies headquartered outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that we may continue to experience significant revenue concentration and have significant revenue from sources outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
historically  we have been involved in significant litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict and we anticipate future litigation expenses will continue to be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue would likely decline 
furthermore  our success in litigation matters pending before courts and regulatory bodies that relate to our intellectual property rights have impacted and will likely continue to impact our ability and the terms upon which we are able to negotiate new or renegotiate existing licenses for our technology 
revenue concentration as indicated above  we have a high degree of revenue concentration 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we expect that our revenue concentration will decrease over time as we license new customers 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and highly cyclical 
we are currently experiencing a period of economic downturn  which may result in  among other things  diminished demand and the erosion of average selling prices in the semiconductor industry 
to the extent that these macroeconomic pressures affect our principal licensees  the demand for our technology may be significantly and adversely impacted and we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our operating results 
the downturn in worldwide economic conditions also threatens the financial health of our commercial counterparties  including companies with whom we have entered into licensing arrangements and litigation settlements providing for ongoing payments to us  and their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to us 
see item a  risk factors 
the royalties we receive are partly a function of the adoption of our chip interfaces by system companies 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our chip interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide us with details as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenue will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
there can be no assurance as to the 
table of contents unit volumes of licensed semiconductors that will be purchased by these companies in the future or as to the level of royalty bearing revenue that our licensees will receive from sales to these companies 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a significant number of other system companies will adopt our chip interfaces or that our dependence upon particular system companies will decrease in the future 
international revenue we expect that revenue derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
to date  all of the revenue from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenue  see note  business segments  exports and major customers of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
expenses we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration including litigation expenses  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenue in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenue change 
engineering 
engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenue and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenue reflects the portion of the total engineering costs which are specifically devoted to individual licensee development and support services 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for the development of generally applicable chip interface technologies  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of the development and implementation schedules of individual licensee contracts 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  legal  finance  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and they can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consistent with our business model  licensing and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to system companies 
in many cases  we must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period  these expenses generally do not correlate to the level of revenue in that period or in recent or future periods 
costs of restatement and related legal activities 
costs of restatement and related legal activities consist primarily of investigation  audit  legal and other professional fees related to the stock option investigation  the filing of the restated financial statements and related litigation and offset by any recoveries 
taxes 
we report certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported for tax purposes 
we recognize revenue for financial reporting purposes as such amounts are earned and this could occur over several reporting periods 
as a result of the above and other differences between tax and financial reporting for income and expense recognition  our net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  we maintain estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions under fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of operations years ended december  revenue royalties contract revenue total revenue costs and expenses cost of contract revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative restructuring costs impairment of intangible asset costs of restatement and related legal activities total costs and expenses operating loss interest and other income  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss includes stock based compensation cost of contract revenue research and development marketing  general and administrative restructuring costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions total revenue royalties contract revenue total revenue royalty revenue patent licenses in the years ended december   and  our largest source of royalties was related to the license of our patents for sdr and ddr compatible products 
royalties decreased approximately million for sdr and ddr compatible products to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease is primarily due the higher licensing payments received in as a result of  among other things  our receipt of the final installment payment from qimonda  which we are presently entitled to under the terms of our license agreement and settlement with qimonda  in the fourth quarter of and lower licensing payments received in as a result of  among other things  the expiration of the elpida licensing 
table of contents agreement in the first quarter of royalties decreased approximately million for sdr and ddr compatible products to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in the decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue in from amd  qimonda and nec  partially offset by increased royalties from toshiba  fujitsu and spansion 
as of december   we had both variable and fixed royalty agreements for our sdr and ddr compatible licenses 
on december   we entered into a five year patent license agreement with amd 
we are recognizing royalty revenue under the amd agreement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payment is received because the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
we recognized royalty revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and we expect to recognize royalty revenue of million and million in and in  respectively  under the amd agreement 
the amd agreement provides a license of our patented technology used in the design of ddr  ddr  fb dimm  pci express and xdr controllers as well as other current and future high speed memory and logic controller interfaces 
on march   we entered into a five year patent license agreement with fujitsu 
we expect to recognize royalty revenue under the fujitsu agreement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payment is received as the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
we recognized a total of million  million and million of royalty revenue in  and  respectively 
the fujitsu agreement provides a license that covers semiconductors  components and systems  but does not include a license to fujitsu for its own manufacturing of commodity sdram other than limited amounts of sdr sdram annually 
on march   we entered into a settlement and license agreement with infineon and its former parent siemens  which was assigned to qimonda in october in connection with infineon s spin off of qimonda 
the settlement and license agreement  among other things  requires qimonda to pay to us aggregate royalties of million in quarterly installments of approximately million  which started on november  the settlement and license agreement further provides that if we enter into licenses with certain other dram manufacturers  qimonda will be required to make additional royalty payments to us that may aggregate up to million 
as we have not yet succeeded in entering into these additional license agreements necessary to trigger qimonda s obligations  qimonda s quarterly payment decreased to million in the fourth quarter of and has ceased in the first quarter of the quarterly payments with qimonda will not recommence until we enter into additional license agreements with certain other dram manufacturers 
in january  qimonda filed for bankruptcy 
see item a  risk factors 
we are in negotiations with new prospective licensees 
we expect sdr and ddr compatible royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
there was no royalty revenue recorded from the intel patent cross license in the year ended december  and  because the term of the agreement expired in june the intel patent cross license agreement represented the second largest source of royalties in the years ended december  royalties under this agreement were million for the year ended december  on february   the federal trade commission the ftc issued an order requiring us to limit the royalty rates charged for certain sdr and ddr sdram memory and controller products sold by licensees after april  the ftc stayed this requirement on march   subject to certain conditions 
one such condition of the stay limits the royalties we can receive under certain contracts so that they do not exceed the ftc s maximum allowable royalties mar or previously withheld royalties 
amounts in excess of mar that are subject to the order are excluded from revenue 
on april   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia the cadc overturned the ftc decision and remanded the matter back to the ftc for further proceedings consistent with the cadc s opinion 
on june   the ftc petitioned the cadc to rehear the case en banc 
on august   the cadc denied the ftc s petition for rehearing of this matter en banc  and on september   the cadc issued its mandate setting aside the ftc s order and instructing the ftc to take actions consistent with the cadc s ruling 
the ftc did not seek  nor did it receive  a stay of the cadc s ruling  and thus the ftc s order in the case has been vacated 
on october   the ftc issued an order ftc 
table of contents disposition order authorizing us to receive the excess consideration that customers have previously deducted from their quarterly payments made to us under the patent license agreement see note litigation and asserted claims 
at the time of the issuance of the mandate on september   million had been determined as amounts of previously withheld royalties which had been excluded from revenue 
as the ftc has issued the ftc disposition order  we recognized the previously withheld royalties of million as revenue when the corresponding cash payments were received 
in the year ended december   million of these previously withheld royalties were received from the customers and recognized as revenue 
technology licenses in the year ended december  and  royalties from xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products represented the second largest category of royalties 
royalties from these products increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to higher royalties from ddr and xdr products 
in the future  we expect royalties from xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products will continue to vary from period to period based on our licensees shipment volumes  sales prices and product mix 
in the years ended december  and  royalties from rdram compatible products represented the third largest source of royalties 
royalties from rdram memory chips and controllers decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the variance was primarily due to the fluctuation of royalties from rdram controllers 
in the year ended december   royalties from rdram compatible products and xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products represented the third and fourth largest source of royalties  respectively 
royalties from rdram memory chips and controllers decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in royalties from xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in contract revenue percentage of completion contracts percentage of completion contract revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to decreased revenue from leadership chip interface contracts  partially offset by increased revenue from industry standard chip interface contracts 
percentage of completion contract revenue increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to increased revenue from leadership and industry standard chip interface contracts 
we believe that percentage of completion contract revenue recognized will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contractual requirements  the amount of work performed  and by changes to work required  as well as new contracts booked in the future 
other contracts other contracts revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in primarily due to decreased revenue from leadership and industry standard chip interface contracts 
other contracts revenue decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in primarily due to decreased revenue from industry standard chip interface contracts offset by increased revenue from leadership chip interface contracts 

table of contents we believe that other contracts revenue will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contract requirements  the timing of completing engineering deliverables  as well as new contracts booked in the future 
engineering costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions engineering costs cost of contract revenue stock based compensation total cost of contract revenue research and development stock based compensation total research and development total engineering costs for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  engineering costs decreased primarily due to tax reimbursement expenses in associated with internal revenue code section a of approximately million and decreased salary and related stock based compensation expenses in due to the restructuring initiative 
the tax reimbursement expenses were associated with our decision to reimburse current employees for the internal revenue code section a penalty taxes imposed on them in connection with their exercise of repriced options in in addition  depreciation and amortization expense decreased in due to lower design software maintenance amortization 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  engineering costs increased primarily due to tax reimbursement expenses in associated with internal revenue code section a of approximately million  increased compensation expenses of million associated with an increase in headcount  increased amortization expense of design software maintenance of million and increased information technology expenses of approximately million offset in part by a decrease in total stock based compensation expense of million 
additionally  stock based compensation expenses include the effect of a change in our estimated forfeiture rates for awards outstanding 
in all periods  cost of contract revenue exceed contract revenue due to the timing of expensing of pre contract costs as well as low utilization of project resources 
in the near term  we expect engineering expenses will be lower than in as a result of our cost reduction initiative undertaken in we intend to continue to make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our leadership position in chip interface technologies and expenses could vary 

table of contents marketing  general and administrative costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions marketing  general and administrative costs marketing  general and administrative costs litigation expense stock based compensation total marketing  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total marketing  general and administrative costs was primarily due to higher litigation expense  partially offset by decreased stock based compensation  salary expenses due to the restructuring initiative in  general legal costs  marketing and advertising costs  professional fees and the lack of the million of tax reimbursement expenses associated with internal revenue code section a incurred in the tax reimbursement expenses were associated with our decision to reimburse current and former non executive employees for the internal revenue code section a penalty taxes imposed on them in connection with their exercise of repriced options in the higher litigation expenses were primarily due to costs incurred in connection with cases that came to trial in for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total marketing  general and administrative costs was primarily due to higher stock based compensation expense of million  professional and consulting fees of million  payroll costs associated with million of severance expense  approximately million of tax reimbursement expenses associated with internal revenue code section a and increased litigation expenses of million which includes an increase of general litigation expenses of million in  offset by a one time achievement payment of million paid to a law firm in 
additionally  stock based compensation expenses include the effect of a change in our estimated forfeiture rates for awards outstanding as well as the effect of performance based restricted stock units 
costs of restatement and related legal activities are discussed below in the section titled costs of restatement of related legal activities 
in the future  marketing  general and administrative costs will vary from period to period based on the advertising  legal  and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken  and the change in marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period due to the variability of litigation activities  but are expected to remain at levels higher than for the foreseeable future 
in the near term  we expect marketing  general and administrative costs will decline as a result of our cost reduction initiative undertaken in however  certain expenses may increase from period to period 
restructuring costs years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions restructuring costs na na for the year ended december   we initiated a workforce reduction in certain areas of excess capacity 
the cash severance  including continuance of certain employee benefits  totaled approximately million and non cash employee severance was approximately million of stock based compensation expense 
we also lease a facility in mountain view  california  through november   which we vacated during the fourth quarter of as a result of the restructuring measures 
this facility is being subleased at a rate equal to our rent associated with the facility and  as a result no restructuring charge was recorded 
the total restructuring charge for the year ended december  was approximately million 
we paid approximately million of severance and 
table of contents benefits during the year 
the remaining million of severance and benefits will be paid during the first quarter of we expect cash savings of approximately million annually as a result of our restructuring measures 
impairment of intangible asset years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions impairment of intangible asset na na during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our intangible assets had no alternative future use and were impaired as a result of a customer s change in technology requirements 
the intangible asset relates to a contractual relationship acquired in the velio acquisition during december costs of restatement and related legal activities years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions costs of restatement and related legal activities costs of restatement and related legal activities consist primarily of investigation  audit  legal and other professional fees related to the stock option investigation and the filing of the restated financial statements and related litigation 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in costs of restatement and related legal activities was primarily associated with the decrease in accounting and consulting charges related to the filing of our restated financial statements in and a decrease in legal expenses in connection with related lawsuits 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we received approximately  shares of rambus stock with a value of approximately million from a former executive as part of the former executive s settlement agreement with rambus in connection with the derivative and class action lawsuits 
the million was recorded as a recovery of costs of restatement and related legal activities 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in costs of restatement and related legal activities was primarily associated with the one time accrual of million in the third quarter of related to the settlement of the consolidated class action lawsuit pertaining to the accounting for stock option grants and related disclosures  offset in part by higher accounting and audit fees and consulting expenses of million in relating to the filing of our restated financial statements in late on january   we  our former executives  current and former members of the board of directors and an insurance company entered into a settlement agreement 
as a result of the agreement  we received million related to reimbursement claims associated with the stock option investigation discussed in note  litigation and asserted claims  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we will recognize the proceeds as a recovery of restatement and related legal activities costs in the consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of on february   the appeal period expired with respect to the security lawsuits class action derivative lawsuit and as a result  the contingencies related to a settlement have been removed 
therefore  we will recognize million during the first quarter of as a recovery of restatement and related legal activities in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  due to the resolution of the security lawsuits  our former executives are now required to reimburse us approximately million 
we will recognize the million during as a recovery of restatement and related legal activities in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest and other income  net years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions interest and other income  net 
table of contents interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities as well as changes in exchange rates 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in interest and other income  net was primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower yields on invested balances  offset by a gain of million related to the repurchase of million in face value of convertible notes for million during the fourth quarter of for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in interest and other income  net was primarily due to higher average investment balances and higher yields on invested balances during in addition  the year ended included amortization of note issuance costs of million  including million that was accelerated into the fourth quarter of  in connection with the calling of the million in convertible notes 
in the future  we expect that interest and other income  net  will vary from period to period based on the amount of cash and marketable securities  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
provision for benefit from income taxes years ended december  to to change change dollars in millions provision for benefit from income taxes nm effective tax rate nm percentage is not meaningful as the change is too large our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the us statutory tax rate applied to our net loss primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the us statutory tax rate applied to our net loss primarily due to research and development tax credits  stock based compensation expense associated with executives and state income taxes 
our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to research and development tax credits  partially offset by the lack of deductibility of certain stock based compensation expense associated with executives 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash income tax provision of million to establish a valuation allowance 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax statutes to fully utilize these assets 
based on all available evidence  we determined it was not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  in millions cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities years ended december  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities

cash needs for the year ended december  were funded primarily from investing activities  as investments in marketable securities matured and were not reinvested 
operating activities cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss for the period adjusted for non cash items  including the tax provision related to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expense  impairment of an asset  offset by gain on repurchase of convertible notes and recovery of restatement and related legal activities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in accrued litigation expenses due to payments related to the class action lawsuit settlement 
cash provided by operating activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss for the period adjusted for non cash items including stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a deferred tax benefit 
changes in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended december  included increases in prepaid and other assets primarily due to prepaid software maintenance agreements and deferred tax assets resulting from our operating loss  decreases in deferred revenue and accrued salaries and benefits and other accrued liabilities  offset by a net increase in accounts payable primarily due to restatement and related legal expenses and capitalized software license maintenance agreements 
cash provided by operating activities of million in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net loss for the period adjusted for non cash items including stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a deferred tax benefit

table of contents cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december  we received proceeds from the issuance of stock from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of million during the fourth quarter of the year and paid million under installment payment plans used to acquire software license agreements 
no other significant financing activities occurred during the year primarily due to the stock option investigation and restatement  during which we suspended our common stock repurchase program and suspended employee stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock associated with exercises of employee stock options and common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock of million 
in addition  we made a million installment payment 
we currently anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next months and to satisfy our cash requirement to pay for our zero coupon convertible senior notes due in we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or investment fair value fluctuations 
additionally  we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit risk exposures in accordance with our policies 
we may also incur additional expenditures related to future potential restructuring activities 
as described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and this annual report on form k  we are involved in ongoing litigation related to the protection of our intellectual property and our past stock option investigation 
any adverse settlements or judgments in any of this litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash balances and cash flows in the period in which such events occur 
contractual obligations we lease our present office facilities in los altos  california  under an operating lease agreement through december  as part of this lease transaction  we provided a letter of credit restricting approximately million of our cash as collateral for certain obligations under the lease 
the cash is restricted as to withdrawal and is managed by a third party subject to certain limitations under our investment policy

fin of approximately million  including million recorded as a reduction of long term deferred tax assets and million in long term income taxes payable  as of december  as noted below in note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  although it is possible that some of the unrecognized tax benefits could be settled within the next months  we cannot reasonably estimate the outcome at this time 
we have commitments with various software vendors for non cancellable license agreements that generally have terms longer than one year 
the above table summarizes those contractual obligations as of december   which are also included on our consolidated balance sheets under current and other long term liabilities 
common stock equivalents  and options share repurchase program in october  the board approved a share repurchase program of our common stock  principally to reduce the dilutive effect of employee stock options 
to date  the board has approved the authorization to repurchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock over an undefined period of time 
for the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares with an aggregate price of million 
as of december   we had repurchased a cumulative total of approximately million shares of our common stock with an aggregate price of approximately million since the commencement of this program 
as of december   there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock 
we record stock repurchases as a reduction to stockholders equity 
as prescribed by apb opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins  we record a portion of the purchase price of the repurchased shares as an increase to accumulated deficit when the cost of the shares repurchased exceeds the average original proceeds per share received from the issuance of common stock 
during the year ended december   the cumulative price of the shares repurchased exceeded the proceeds received from the issuance of the same number of shares 
the excess of million was recorded as an increase to accumulated deficit for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we did not repurchase any common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
determination of whether or not these criteria have been met may require us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates based upon current information and historical experience 
our revenue consists of royalty revenue and contract revenue generated from agreements with semiconductor companies  system companies and certain reseller arrangements 
royalty revenue consists of patent license and technology license royalties 
contract revenue consist of fixed license fees  fixed engineering fees and service fees associated with integration of our technology solutions into our customers products 
contract revenue may also include support or maintenance 
reseller arrangements generally provide for the pass through of a percentage of the fees paid to the reseller by the reseller s customer for use of our patent and technology licenses 
we do not recognize revenue for these arrangements until we have received notice of revenue earned by and paid to the reseller  accompanied by the pass through payment from the reseller 
we do not pay commissions to the reseller for these arrangements 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
in such arrangements  revenue is only recognized to the extent that is consistent with the cancellation provisions 
cancellation provisions within such contracts 
table of contents generally provide for a prospective cancellation with no refund of fees already remitted by customers for products provided and payment for services rendered prior to the date of cancellation 
unbilled receivables represent enforceable claims and are deemed collectible in connection with our revenue recognition policy 
royalty revenue we recognize royalty revenue upon notification by our licensees and when deemed collectible 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally either require licensees to give us notification and to pay the royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur or are based on a fixed royalty that is due within days of the end of the quarter 
we have two types of royalty revenue patent license royalties and technology license royalties 
patent licenses 
we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and systems companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
we generally recognize revenue from these arrangements as amounts become due 
the contractual terms of the agreements generally provide for payments over an extended period of time 
technology licenses 
we develop proprietary and industry standard chip interface products  such as rdram and xdr that we provide to our customers under technology license agreements 
these arrangements include royalties  which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold 
we recognize revenue from these arrangements upon notification from the licensee of the royalties earned and when collectability is deemed reasonably assured 
contract revenue we generally recognize revenue using percentage of completion for development contracts related to licenses of our interface solutions  such as xdr and flexio that involve significant engineering and integration services 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based upon contract costs incurred 
prior to the first quarter of  we determined progress to completion using labor hours incurred 
the change to input measures better reflects the overall gross margin over the life of the contract 
this change did not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we have evaluated use of output measures versus input measures and have determined that our output is not sufficiently uniform with respect to cost  time and effort per unit of output to use output measures as a measure of progress to completion 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees may be due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the total costs required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total efforts necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the newly estimated total efforts necessary to complete a project were longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees will be recognized over a longer period 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we will recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenue or unbilled receivables in any given period 
we also recognize revenue in accordance with sop  sop and sop for development contracts related to licenses of our chip interface products that involve non essential engineering services and post contract support pcs 
these sops apply to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the products and services provided under these 
table of contents arrangements are comprised of license fees and engineering service fees which are not essential to the functionality of the product 
our rates for pcs and for engineering services are specific to each development contract and not standardized in terms of rates or length 
because of these characteristics  we do not have a sufficient population of contracts from which to derive vendor specific objective evidence for each of the elements 
therefore  as required by sop  after we deliver the product  if the only undelivered element is pcs  we will recognize all revenue ratably over either the contractual pcs period or the period during which pcs is expected to be provided 
we review assumptions regarding the pcs periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue to be recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
litigation we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note  litigation and asserted claims of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
based upon consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we accrue for losses related to litigation if we determine that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if a specific loss amount cannot be estimated  we review the range of possible outcomes and accrue the low end of the range of estimates 
any such accrual would be charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
this process requires us to calculate various items including permanent and temporary differences between the financial accounting and tax treatment of certain income and expense items  differences between federal and state tax treatment of these items  the amount of taxable income reported to various states  foreign taxes and tax credits 
the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes results in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  of approximately million  which consists of net operating loss carryovers  tax credit carryovers  depreciation and amortization  employee stock based compensation expenses and certain liabilities 
for the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash income tax provision of million to establish a valuation allowance 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is solely dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax statutes to fully utilize these assets 
our forecasted future operating results are highly influenced by  among other factors  assumptions regarding our ability to achieve our forecasted revenue  our ability to effectively manage our expenses in line with our forecasted revenue and general trends in the semiconductor industry 
during the quarter ended june   we weighed both positive and negative evidence and determined that there is a need for the valuation allowance due to the existence of three years of historical cumulative losses and a revised forecast that projected future losses from operations in the us  which we considered significant verifiable negative evidence 
though considered positive evidence  projected income from favorable patent and related settlement litigation were not included in the determination for the valuation allowance due to our inability to reliably estimate the timing and amounts of such settlements 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
pursuant to footnote of sfas no 
r  tax attributes related to stock option windfall deductions should not be recorded until they result in a reduction of cash taxes payable 
starting in  we no longer include net operating losses attributable to stock option windfall deductions as components of our gross deferred tax assets 
the benefit of these net operating losses will be recorded to equity when they reduce cash taxes payable 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
although fasb interpretation no 
 which we adopted on january   provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  the new threshold and measurement attributes prescribed by the pronouncement will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what is currently estimated  a material impact on income tax expense could result 
stock based compensation for the years ended december   and  we maintained stock plans covering a broad range of potential equity grants including stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units and performance based instruments 
in addition  we sponsor an employee stock purchase plan espp  whereby eligible employees are entitled to purchase common stock semi annually  by means of limited payroll deductions  at a discount from the fair market value of the common stock as of specific dates 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in our statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to our employees  directors and consultants including employee stock options  nonvested equity stock and equity stock units  and employee stock purchase grants 
stock based compensation expense is measured at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  reduced by an estimate of the annualized rate of expected forfeitures  and is recognized as expense over the employees expected requisite service period  generally using the straight line method 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under previous accounting rules 
we selected the modified prospective method of adoption  which recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of all share based payments granted after january  and for the fair value of all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on the date of adoption 
this method did not require a restatement of prior periods 
however  awards granted and still unvested on the date of adoption are attributed to expense under sfas no 
r  including the application of a forfeiture rate on a prospective basis 
our forfeiture rate represents the historical rate at which our stock based awards were surrendered prior to vesting 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised on a cumulative basis  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to fiscal year  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred  for the purposes of pro forma information under sfas no 
see note  equity incentive plans and stock based compensation  of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the valuation of stock based compensation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio 
interest rate fluctuation may arise from changes in the market s view of the quality of the security issuer  the overall economic outlook  and the time to maturity of our portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by investing only in high quality  highly liquid instruments 
securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three industry standard rating agencies as follows a by standard poor s  p by moody s and or f by fitch 
securities with original maturities of greater than one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows aa by standard poor s  aa by moody s and or aa by fitch 
by corporate policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure to million for any one issuer 
our policy requires that at least of the portfolio be in securities with a maturity of days or less 
in addition  we may make investments in securities with maturities up to months 
however  the bias of our investment policy is toward shorter maturities 

table of contents we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of us dollar financial instruments such as treasuries  government agencies  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purposes of realizing trading profits 
however  we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if we experience unforeseen liquidity requirements 
in such a case if the environment has been one of rising interest rates we may experience a realized loss  similarly  if the environment has been one of declining interest rates we may experience a realized gain 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable securities of million including cash equivalents 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels as of december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
actual results may differ materially from this sensitivity analysis 
the table below summarizes the book value  fair value  unrealized gains and related weighted average interest rates for our marketable securities portfolio as of december  and december  weighted unrealized rate of fair value book value gain  net return available for sale securities dollars in thousands money market funds municipal bonds and notes us government bonds and notes corporate notes  bonds  and commercial paper total cash equivalents and marketable securities cash total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities december  weighted unrealized rate of fair value book value gain  net return available for sale securities dollars in thousands money market funds municipal bonds and notes us government bonds and notes corporate notes  bonds  and commercial paper total cash equivalents and marketable securities cash total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we bill our customers in us dollars 
although the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may impact our customers  and thus indirectly impact us  we do not attempt to hedge this indirect and speculative risk 
our overseas operations consist primarily of small business development offices in any one country and one design center in india 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure  however  as of december   we believe our foreign currency exposure is not material enough to warrant foreign currency hedging
