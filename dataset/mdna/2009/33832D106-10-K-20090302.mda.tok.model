item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general industry trends the senior living industry generally is experiencing growth as a result of demographic factors 
according to census data  the population in the united states over age is growing much faster than the general population 
a large number of independent and assisted living communities were built in the s 
this development activity caused an excess supply of new  high priced communities 
longer than projected fill up periods resulted in low occupancy  price discounting and financial distress for many independent and assisted living operators 
development activity was significantly reduced in the early part of this decade 
we believe that the nationwide supply and demand for these types of facilities is about balanced today 
we believe that the aging of the united states population and the almost complete reliance of independent and assisted living services upon revenues from residents private resources should mean that these types of facilities can be profitably operated 
the increasing availability of assisted living facilities in the s caused occupancy at many snfs to decline 
this fact  together with restrictions on development of new snfs by most states  has generally caused nursing care to be delivered in older facilities 
we believe that many snfs currently in operation are becoming physically obsolete and that political pressures from an aging population will eventually cause governmental authorities to permit increased new construction 

table of contents beginning in  problems in certain domestic credit markets presaged a global credit crisis that has led to recession in the united states and abroad 
the recession has resulted in aggressive government spending in the united states  significant corporate layoffs  reduced availability of credit on reasonable terms in most markets  and lower real estate prices 
at this time  the depth and duration of this recession cannot be determined 
this economic weakness has dampened demand for some types of senior living communities in certain markets and our occupancy rates have modestly declined 
also  we have seen some pricing pressures from competition 
at the same time  we believe our business to be inherently healthy and that the anticipated decline in senior housing construction may have an offsetting effect to any decline in demand 
rehabilitation hospitals provide intensive medical services  including physical therapy  occupational therapy and speech language services beyond the capability customarily available in snfs 
we believe that if we are successful in our operation of our rehabilitation hospitals  our reputation in the rehabilitation business including providing outpatient rehabilitation services will be enhanced 
a reputation for providing high quality rehabilitation services may help create opportunities to acquire additional irfs or to provide increasing amounts of rehabilitation services at our senior living communities 
institutional pharmacies provide large quantities of drugs at locations where patients with recurring pharmacy requirements are concentrated 
the business rationale for an institutional pharmacy is to deliver drugs and pharmacy services more efficiently and at lower costs than from expensive retail locations which cater to short term requirements 
the aging of the population and recent pharmacological innovations have created rapidly growing demand for pharmacy drugs and services 
the medicare part d prescription drug benefit was implemented in pursuant to the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or mma  and by december  approximately of medicare beneficiaries had enrolled in medicare part d  according to the us department of health and human services 
in  the most recent date for which information is publicly available the government share of all prescription drug expenditures in the united states rose to approximately  including approximately from the medicare program and approximately from medicaid programs 
because the mma has increased medicare expenditures for prescription drugs  we anticipate that the federal government and congress will seek to implement various cost control measures and as a result  the profitability of providing pharmacy goods and services may be reduced 
we earn our senior living revenue primarily by providing housing and services to our senior living residents 
during  approximately of our senior living revenues came from the medicare and medicaid programs and approximately of our senior living revenues came from residents private resources 
we bill all private pay residents in advance for the housing and services to be provided in the following month 
our material expenses are wages and benefits includes wages for our employees working at our senior living communities and wage related expenses such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and other benefits 
other operating expenses includes utilities  housekeeping  dietary  maintenance  marketing  insurance and community level administrative costs at our senior living communities 
rent expense we lease of our senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing and four senior living communities from hcpi 
hospital expenses includes wages and benefits for our hospital based staff and other operating expenses related to our hospital business 

table of contents pharmacy expenses includes the cost of drugs dispensed to our patients as well as wages and benefits for our pharmacies staff and other operating expenses related to our pharmacy business 
general and administrative expenses principally wage related costs for headquarters and regional staff supporting our communities  hospitals and pharmacies 
depreciation and amortization expense we incur depreciation expense on buildings and furniture and equipment that we own  and we incur amortization expense on certain identifiable intangible assets related to our pharmacy acquisitions 
interest and other expenses primarily includes interest on outstanding debt and amortization of deferred financing costs 
our reportable segments consist of our senior living community business and our rehabilitation hospital business 
in the senior living community segment  we operate independent living or congregate care communities  assisted living communities and snfs 
our rehabilitation hospital segment provides inpatient health rehabilitation services at two hospital locations and three satellite locations and outpatient rehabilitation services at outpatient clinics 
we do not consider our pharmacy operations to be a material  separately reportable segment of our business but we report our pharmacy revenues and expense as separate items within our corporate and other activities 
all of our operations and assets are located in the united states  except with regard to our two captive insurance companies which participate in our workers compensation and liability insurance programs and are located in bermuda and the cayman islands 
we use segment operating profit as an important measure to evaluate our performance and for business decision making purposes 
segment operating profit excludes interest and other income  interest expense and certain corporate expenses

the rent expense increase was due to the communities that we began to lease during and our payment of additional rent for senior living community capital improvements purchased by senior housing since january  the increase in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures for our owned communities 
our interest and other income increased by  or  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of recognition of an  gain related to the sale of a property that was previously deferred until the buyer paid in full our note receivable related to the sale during the first quarter of our interest and other expense decreased by  for the year ended december   primarily due to our september prepayment of two united states department of housing  or hud  insured mortgages secured by one of our communities 
we paid million in principal and interest to retire these two mortgages 
because we had recorded these mortgages at a premium to their face value  we recognized a gain of  in connection with this early extinguishment of debt

effective for discharges after april   medicare inflationary rate increases for irfs have been set at zero percent for federal fiscal years and our hospitals had received a medicare rate increase of effective october  but their rates were reduced by effective for discharges after april  also  on july   cms issued a rule updating the medicare irf prospective rate formulas for federal fiscal year  which cms estimated would result in a decrease of to total medicare payments to irfs for the year 
the decrease in hospital expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to reductions in labor and benefit expenses and the closing of several unprofitable outpatient clinics 
the rent expense increase in the year ended december  was due to our payment of additional rent for hospital capital improvements purchased by senior housing since january  the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to our write off of long lived assets offset by our purchase of furniture and fixtures and information technology systems for our rehabilitation hospitals 
during our annual review of long lived and other intangible assets  we identified and recorded an impairment of long lived assets related to our two rehabilitation hospitals of million 
corporate and other the increase in pharmacy revenues for the year ended december  was primarily the result of adding new customers from both our existing senior living and third party communities partially offset by the establishment of a contractual allowance reserve of million

the increase in pharmacy expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to adding new customers 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the costs associated with the communities we began to operate in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to our purchase of furniture and fixtures and information technology systems for our pharmacies and corporate and regional offices

due to the impairment of certain of these related items of goodwill for book purposes  we recognized a portion of the deferred tax liability as a reduction in the income tax provision  and partially offset by a tax benefit of  related to prior year refunds resulting from the application of tax credits that offset federal alternative minimum taxes 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the losses in both years are primarily due to operating expenses we incurred as a result of our shutting down operations at two communities in each of and and two pharmacies in the loss for the year ended december  also includes a  impairment loss of goodwill at our pharmacy located in california and the write down of fixed assets of million at one of our assisted living communities

table of contents rehabilitation hospitals the increase in hospital revenues  hospital expenses  rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense from our hospitals in over was a result of our beginning operations at our hospitals in october we are currently experiencing losses from our operation of these rehabilitation hospitals and we may be unable to operate these hospitals profitably 
the percentage of patients at one of our hospitals who are required to meet certain medicare criteria increased to on july  and this percentage requirement was scheduled to increase to at the other hospital on january   and to at both of our hospitals in the future 
however  in december this medicare requirement was retroactively rolled back to for both hospitals for fiscal years starting on and after july  we believe that we are in compliance with these current medicare requirements 
corporate and other the increase in pharmacy revenues and increase in pharmacy expenses for the year ended december  was primarily the result of our acquiring one pharmacy in each of may and november the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  over the same period in primarily results from the administrative costs associated with the communities we began to operate in  from the communities we began to operate in that were previously managed for us by sls and from the rehabilitation hospitals we began to operate in october the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  over the same period in is primarily attributable to increases in assets associated with our pharmacy acquisitions 
our interest and other income decreased by  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of a million payment from healthsouth corporation in to settle numerous transition matters and claims related to our assumption of the operations of the two rehabilitation hospitals  offset by interest income on higher levels of investable cash in resulting from our notes offering 
our interest and other expense increased by million for the year ended december   due to the issuance of the notes in october for the year ended december   we recognized taxes of million  which includes million of alternative minimum taxes and certain state taxes that are payable without regard to our tax loss carry forwards and  of a deferred tax liability arising from the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes but not for book purposes 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  decreased million to million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the losses in both years are primarily due to operating expenses we incurred as a result of our shutting down operations at two communities in each of and and two pharmacies in these losses were lower in because we sold two of the communities which incurred losses in  in liquidity and capital resources for the three months and year ended december   we recorded million and million  respectively  of cash from continuing operations 
at year end we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
we had no amounts outstanding on our million revolving line of credit and million outstanding on million available under our line with ubs 
we believe that our operations will continue to provide us with adequate cash flow to run our businesses 
table of contents and invest in and maintain our properties 
if  however  our revenues continue to decline and we are unable to generate positive cash flow for some period of time  we intend to further reduce costs across the company and to borrow funds from our outstanding lines of credit 
recent developments investments at december   we had million invested in student loan ars with a par value of million which we classified as long term investments in trading securities 
starting in february  auctions affecting our ars failed to close on their settlement dates 
on march   we reclassified our ars from current assets to non current assets due to our belief that the market for student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of months to recover 
our ars consist primarily of bonds issued by various entities to fund student loans pursuant to the federal family education loan program 
the maturities of our ars range from to all of our ars were rated aaa by at least one nationally recognized debt rating agency when we made these investments  and  to our knowledge  none of these ratings have been reduced 
based upon our analysis of impairment factors through december   we have recognized an unrealized loss of million on our investments in these securities 
the funds which we invested in ars were held to invest in potential acquisitions 
accordingly  these funds are not needed to fund our current operations and we do not expect the failure of auctions affecting our ars holdings to have a material adverse impact upon our day to day operations 
in november  we entered into a settlement with ubs regarding our ars made through ubs 
the settlement offer was made in connection with ubs settlement with the securities and exchange commission  the new york attorney general and other state agencies related to ubs sale and marketing of ars 
under the terms of the settlement  we obtained a put right pursuant to which ubs will repurchase our ars at of par value including accrued and unpaid interest  if any at our option during the period beginning june and ending july in certain circumstances  ubs has the right to purchase these securities earlier at par 
as part of the settlement terms  we released ubs from all claims arising from its marketing of the ars to us 
in connection with the settlement  ubs provided us with a non recourse credit facility secured by our investments in these ars 
the principal amount available to us under the credit facility is up to of the market value of the ars from time to time 
as of december   the estimated fair value of our investment in ars was million and million was outstanding under the credit facility 
our interest rate under the credit facility varies depending on the interest payable to us on the ars  but will not exceed libor plus basis points 
we expect to sell our ars by exercising our put right with ubs 
however  if we do not exercise our put right before july   it will expire and ubs will have no further right or obligation to buy our ars 
we recorded a gain of million for the fair value of the put right we received 
the value of the put right is the difference between our estimated value of ubs repurchase obligation and our estimate of the fair value of the ars 
accordingly  the value of the put right may increase or decrease in the future as our estimate of the value of ubs repurchase obligation and our estimate of the fair value of the ars changes 
we will reassess the fair values in future reporting periods based on several factors  including auction and investment redemption experience  changes in credit ratings of ubs and our ars investments  market risk and other factors 
based on our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash  we do not believe that illiquidity of our ars will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs 
in january  we purchased and retired million par value  or  of our outstanding notes for million  plus accrued interest 
we financed this purchase  principally by borrowings under our ubs credit facility 
as a result of this transaction  we expect to record a gain of approximately million net of related unamortized costs on early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 
table of contents assets and liabilities our total current assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  our current liabilities were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in current assets was primarily the result of our reclassifying our investments in ars from current to long term assets 
cash provided from continuing operations was million at december  compared to million at december  excluding cash flows associated with our investment securities  cash provided from continuing operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
acquisitions of property plant and equipment  including the acquisition of senior living communities  on a net basis after considering the proceeds from sales of fixed assets to senior housing  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the years ended and  as a result of an early repayment of debt  we repaid long term debt of million and million  respectively 
acquisitions including the initiation of long term leases and related financings in  we began to lease from senior housing senior living communities with  units which senior housing acquired from third parties 
three of these communities are assisted living communities  three are assisted living communities which offer some skilled nursing services  three are only independent living communities and two are congregate care retirement communities which offer independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our initial rent payable to senior housing for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases at these communities after in april  we acquired a unit assisted living community located in tennessee for million 
we financed the acquisition by assuming a million non recourse hud insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand 
the interest rate on the assumed hud insured mortgage is 
residents pay substantially all of our charges at this community from their private resources 
in  we leased from senior housing senior living communities with a total of  living units 
twenty seven of these communities are assisted living communities one of which offers some skilled nursing services and one of which offers some independent living services  eight are independent living communities and two are continuing care retirement communities which offer independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing services 
our rent payable to senior housing for these communities is million per year  plus future increases calculated as a percentage of the revenue increases for of these communities after we added of these communities to our existing lease with senior housing which has a term ending in  with a renewal option thereafter  and we added nine of these communities to our lease with senior housing which has a term ending in  with a renewal option thereafter 
in connection with one of the leases we initiated in  we also acquired from the prior owner of the communities its ownership interest in certain operating companies  working capital  certain long term liabilities  and operating practices and processes  especially in the memory care area 
we accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with sfas and after allocating the purchase price to applicable assets and liabilities based on their fair value  recorded as goodwill the million excess consideration over fair value of identifiable assets 
included in the senior living communities described above are seven assisted living communities with units located in pennsylvania and new jersey that were previously operated by newseasons assisted living communities  inc  or newseasons  under a lease from senior housing 
we leased these communities in july for annual rent of approximately million per year 
in consideration of our lease assumption  newseasons paid us million and transferred title to certain personal property located at the communities 
we recorded the newseasons consideration as a deferred credit on our balance sheet  which we are amortizing as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining lease term 

table of contents simultaneously with leasing these seven communities from senior housing  we purchased three additional newseasons communities from senior housing with units located in pennsylvania and new jersey for million 
we allocated the purchase price of these communities to land  building and equipment 
the purchase price of these properties equaled the seller s net book value and the fair market value of these properties based on appraisals by an independent appraiser 
the ten newseasons communities complement our business strategy of focusing our operations in high quality senior living assets where residents pay for our services with private resources 
the majority of the revenues from these communities come from residents private resources 
in december  we acquired seven independent and assisted living communities  with a total of living units  located in north carolina and south carolina for a purchase price of million plus closing costs 
we financed the acquisition with cash on hand and drawings under our recently established credit facility with ubs 
our leases with senior housing as of december   we leased senior living communities and two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing under seven leases in four combinations 
our leases with senior housing require us to pay minimum rent of million annually and percentage rent for most senior living communities but not for our rehabilitation hospitals 
we paid approximately million and million in percentage rent to senior housing for the years ended december  and  respectively 
upon our request  senior housing may purchase capital improvements made at the properties we lease from senior housing and increase our rent pursuant to contractual formulas 
during the year ended december   senior housing reimbursed us million for capital expenditures made at the properties leased from senior housing and these purchases resulted in our annual rent being increased by million 
on june   we and senior housing realigned our three principal combination leases 
the aggregate rent payable by us to senior housing is unchanged as a result of this lease realignment and the rent on future sales of property to senior housing  if and as senior housing purchases improvements to the leased properties  will be set at the greater of per annum or the year treasury rate plus basis points 
our revenues our revenues from services to residents at our senior living communities and patients of our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics are our primary source of cash to fund our operating expenses  including rent  principal and interest payments on our debt and our capital expenditures 
during the past year  our occupancy has been negatively affected by worsening economic conditions in many of the markets that we serve 
these conditions appear to be impacting many companies both within and outside of our industry and there can be no certainty as to when current economic conditions may improve 
at some of our communities and at our rehabilitation hospitals and clinics  operating revenues for skilled nursing and rehabilitation services are received from the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare and medicaid revenues were earned primarily at our snfs and our two rehabilitation hospitals 
we derived and of our revenues from these programs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net medicare revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in october and  our senior living community medicare rates increased by approximately 
table of contents and  respectively  over the prior period 
our net medicaid revenues from services to senior living community residents totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
federal agencies and some members of congress have proposed medicare and medicaid policy changes and freezes on rate increases or rate reductions to be phased in during the next several years 
in addition  some of the states in which we operate either have not raised medicaid rates by amounts sufficient to offset increasing costs or are expected to freeze or reduce medicaid rates 
the current recession and worsening economic conditions are causing budget shortfalls in many states  increasing the likelihood of medicaid rate reductions  freezes on rate increases  or increases that are insufficient to offset increasing operating costs 
the magnitude of the potential medicare and medicaid rate reductions and the impact on us of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing expenses  as well as the impact on us of the potential medicare and medicaid policy changes  cannot currently be estimated  but they may be material to our operations and may affect our future results of operations 
effective as of october   cms increased medicare rates for snfs by approximately for the federal fiscal year ending september   under a rule adding an annual update to account for inflation in the cost of goods and services included in a snf stay 
cms had proposed a recalibration of the payment categories for snfs  which would have resulted in a net reduction of rates by approximately in federal fiscal year  but delayed the recalibration in order to continue to evaluate the data 
on july   as part of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  congress enacted an month extension of the medicare outpatient therapy exception process through the end of  under which medicare may approve payments for medically necessary outpatient therapies which exceed the medicare payment caps 
this july  law forestalls a reduction in certain therapy revenues that we have historically realized 
we began to operate two rehabilitation hospitals in october approximately and of our revenues from these hospitals came from the medicare and medicaid programs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in october  the medicare rates at our irfs increased by approximately over the prior period 
however  this increase was later rescinded and  for payments on and after april   the medicare rate increase was reset to zero per cent for federal fiscal years and also  on july   cms issued a rule updating the medicare irf prospective rate formulas for the federal fiscal year the rule revises the weights assigned to patient case mix groups that are used to calculate rates under the irf prospective payment system  and re sets the outlier threshold to maintain estimated outlier payments at of total estimated irf payments for the year 
cms estimated that the rule would result in a decrease of to total medicare payments to irfs for the year 
in may  cms issued the rule establishing revised medicare criteria that rehabilitation hospitals are required to meet in order to participate as irfs in the medicare program 
as recently amended  the rule requires that for cost reporting periods starting on and after july   of a facility s inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of the cms s designated medical conditions 
an irf that fails to meet the requirements of this rule is subject to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider  and the effect of such reclassification would be to lower medicare payment rates 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with the cms requirements to remain an irf 
however  the actual percentage of patients at these hospitals who meet these medicare requirements may not be or remain as high as we believe or anticipate or may decline 
our failure to remain in compliance  or a cms finding of noncompliance  if it occurs  will result in our receiving lower medicare rates than we currently receive at our hospitals 
termination of sls management agreements to better understand the results of our ongoing operating business for the year ended december  and to enable investors to more readily compare our operating results from to subsequent years  we believe it may be useful to consider what our results of operations would have been in  excluding our termination payments to sls 
the information in the following chart should not be considered as an alternative to income loss from continuing operations or income loss 
table of contents from continuing operations per share or any other operating or performance measure established by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for the year ended december  loss from continuing operations exclude termination expense for certain sunrise management agreements income from continuing operations excluding termination charges insurance increases over time in the costs of insurance  especially tort liability insurance  workers compensation and employee health insurance  have had an adverse impact upon our results of operations 
although we self insure a large portion of these costs  our costs have increased as a result of the higher costs that we incur to settle claims and to purchase re insurance for claims in excess of the self insurance amounts 
these increased costs may continue in the future 
for more information about our existing insurance see item business insurance of this annual report on form k 
to obtain control over our insurance costs  we and other companies to which rmr provides management services have recently formed an insurance company which may begin to underwrite certain of our insurance requirements

pharmacies between and  we acquired six institutional pharmacies and one mail order pharmacy located in wisconsin  nebraska  california  south carolina and virginia 
our total purchase price for these pharmacies was million  including million in certain of our pharmacy businesses have been discontinued  as described below 
rehabilitation hospitals we commenced operations at our two hospitals on october  discontinued operations during  we agreed with senior housing that it should sell two assisted living communities in pennsylvania  which we currently lease 
we and senior housing are in the process of selling these assisted living communities and  upon their sale  our annual rent payable to senior housing will decrease by an amount equal to of the net proceeds of the sale to senior housing 
as of december   we have disposed of substantially all of our assets and settled all liabilities related to their two senior living communities 
in december  we decided to sell our institutional pharmacy located in california and our mail order pharmacy located in nebraska 
the assets and liabilities related to these two pharmacies are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
we sold the institutional pharmacy located in california on january  we have been unable to sell the mail order pharmacy on acceptable terms and we expect to discontinue all its operations on or about march  we have reclassified the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented to show the results of operations of the communities and pharmacies which have been sold or are expected to be 
table of contents sold as discontinued 
a summary of the operating results of these discontinued operations included in the financial statements for the years ended december   and is for the years ended december  revenues expenses net loss contractual obligations table as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations debt obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet total debt obligations consist of the amounts due under several hud insured mortgages  our ubs credit facility as well as our outstanding notes 
operating lease obligations consist of the minimum lease payments to senior housing and hcpi through the lease terms ending between and these amounts do not include percentage rent that may become payable under these leases 
other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet are primarily insurance reserves related to workers compensation and professional liability insurance 
equity and debt financings and covenants in april  we issued  common shares in an underwritten public offering raising net proceeds of million 
we used a portion of the proceeds raised in this offering to pay million in termination fees for sls management agreements we terminated in june  and we added the remainder to our cash balances 
in april  we financed the acquisition of a unit assisted living community located in tennessee for million by assuming a million non recourse hud insured mortgage and paying the balance of the purchase price with cash on hand 
the coupon interest rate on the assumed hud insured mortgage is and its effective market rate is 
in october  we issued million principal amount of notes 
our net proceeds from this issuance were approximately million 
we used the proceeds raised to pay million in termination fees for the remaining management agreements with sls  and we added the remainder to our cash balances 
these notes are convertible into our common shares at any time 
the initial conversion rate  which is subject to adjustment  is common shares per  principal amount of notes  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these notes mature on october  we may prepay the notes at any time after october  and the note holders may require that we purchase all or a portion of these notes on each of october of  and we issued these notes pursuant 
table of contents to an indenture which contains various customary covenants 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants of this indenture 
in january  we purchased and retired million par value  or  of our outstanding notes for approximately million plus accrued interest 
we financed this purchase  principally by borrowings under our ubs credit facility 
as a result of this transaction  we expect to record a gain of approximately million net of related unamortized costs on early extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of we have a million revolving secured credit facility with a financial institution available for general business purposes  including acquisitions and working capital  which is currently scheduled to expire in may the amount we are able to borrow at any time is subject to limitations based upon qualifying collateral 
we are the borrower under this revolving credit facility and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the facility  which is secured by our and our guarantor subsidiaries accounts receivable  deposit accounts and related assets 
the facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain collateral  minimum net worth and certain other financial ratios  and this facility also places limits on our ability to incur or assume debt or create liens with respect to certain of our assets and has other customary provisions 
in certain circumstances and subject to available collateral and lender approvals  the maximum amounts which we may borrow under this credit facility may be increased to million 
the termination date may be extended twice  in each case by twelve months upon our payment of extension fees and other conditions  including lender s approvals 
as of december  and february   no amounts were outstanding with million available under this credit facility 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this credit facility 
we may borrow additional amounts under the facility before it expires in may if we have outstanding borrowings under the facility and are unable to extend it when it expires  we would need to explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives may include incurring additional debt and engaging in sale leaseback transactions relating to some or all of our owned communities 
while we believe we will be able to extend this facility or raise funds to repay any outstanding borrowings  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that our cost associated with any such transaction will be reasonable 
if current capital market conditions continue or worsen  our lender under this facility may be unable or unwilling to fund advances which we request or we may not be able to access additional capital 
impacts such as these and general capital market conditions could impair our ability to make future acquisitions and make our current growth plans unachievable 
also  the current market conditions have led to materially increased credit spreads which  if they continue  may result in a material increase in the interest rate under this facility when it is renewed or extended 
in november  we entered into a non recourse credit facility with ubs which is available for acquisitions  working capital and general business purposes 
the amount we are able to borrow is of the fair value of the ars which are collateral for the loan and such amount may vary over time 
our interest rate under the credit facility will also vary depending on the interest payable to us on the ars  but will not exceed libor plus basis points 
as of december   the estimated fair value of our investment in ars was million 
as of december  and february   we have million and million outstanding under this credit facility  respectively and million and approximately million remained available for drawing as of december  and february   respectively 
as of december  and february  we believe we are in compliance with all applicable covenants under this credit facility 
in  we prepaid seven mortgages that were secured by six of our senior living communities 
we paid million to retire these seven mortgages  which consisted of approximately million in principal and interest and  in prepayment penalties 
because we had carried these mortgages at a premium to their face value  we recognized a net gain of million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt 

table of contents in september  we prepaid two hud insured mortgages that were secured by one of our senior living communities 
we paid million in principal and interest to retire these two mortgages  and no prepayment penalty was required 
because we had recorded these mortgages at a premium to their face value under applicable accounting rules  we recognized a net gain of  in connection with this early extinguishment of debt 
at december   three of our communities remained encumbered by hud insured mortgages totaling million 
the weighted average interest rate on these mortgages is 
payments of principal and interest are due monthly until maturities at varying dates ranging from june to july these mortgages contain standard hud mortgage covenants 
as of december  and february   we believe we are in compliance with all covenants of these mortgages 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  third party guarantees  material joint ventures or partnerships 
related person transactions we were a owned subsidiary of senior housing before december  on december   senior housing distributed substantially all of our then outstanding shares to its shareholders 
at the time of our spin off  all of the persons serving as our directors were trustees of senior housing 
in order to effect this spin off and to govern relations after the spin off  we entered into agreements with senior housing and others 
since then we have entered into various leases and other agreements which confirm and modify these undertakings 
among other matters  these agreements provide that so long as senior housing remains a real estate investment trust  or a reit  we may not waive the share ownership restrictions in our charter on the ability of any person or group to acquire more than of any class of our equity shares without the consent of senior housing  so long as we are a tenant of senior housing  we will not permit nor take any action that  in the reasonable judgment of senior housing  might jeopardize the tax status of senior housing as a reit  senior housing has the option  upon the acquisition by a person or group of more than of our voting stock and upon other change in control events affecting us  as defined in those documents including  in certain of the senior housing leases  the adoption of any proposal or the election to our board of directors of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved  nominated or appointed  as the case may be  by vote of a majority of our directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual  to cancel all of our rights under the leases we have with senior housing  and so long as we have a shared services agreement with rmr we will not acquire or finance any real estate without first giving senior housing or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  the opportunity to acquire or finance real estate investments of the type in which senior housing or any other publicly owned reit or other entity managed by rmr  respectively  invests 
senior housing is our largest landlord 
in addition to providing management services to us  rmr also manages senior housing 
one of our directors  mr 
barry portnoy  is currently a managing trustee of senior housing 
because of these and other relationships we and senior housing may be considered related persons 
also  because of these relationships all of our transactions with senior housing are separately approved by our independent directors and senior housing s independent trustees 

table of contents of the senior living communities we operated on december   are leased from senior housing for total annual rent of million 
in addition  we also lease our two rehabilitation hospitals from senior housing for a total minimum rent of million 
since january   we have entered into several transactions with senior housing  including during the three months ended march   we leased senior living properties with a total of  units from senior housing for initial rent of million and added them to what we now refer to as senior housing lease no 
and lease no 
 which have current terms expiring in and  respectively 
percentage rent  based on increases in gross revenues at these properties  will commence in on june   we realigned three of our leases with senior housing 
lease no 
now includes properties  including nine properties which we first leased during the first quarter of this lease includes independent living communities  assisted living communities and snfs  and expires in lease no 
now includes properties  including independent living communities  assisted living communities  snfs and our two rehabilitation hospitals  and expires in lease no 
now includes properties  including properties acquired during the first quarter of  properties acquired during the third quarter of and one property acquired on november  described below 
this lease includes independent living communities  assisted living communities and snfs and expires in the total rent payable by us to senior housing for these properties was unchanged as a result of this lease realignment 
the increased rent payable for these three leases  if and as senior housing purchases improvements we make to the leased properties  will be the greater of per annum or the year treasury rate plus basis points  but not to exceed 
on july   we acquired three assisted living properties with living units that were formerly operated by newseasons from senior housing for million and we assumed the newseasons lease obligations to senior housing for the remaining seven properties that newseasons formerly operated 
the rent payable by us for these seven properties is approximately million per annum under what we refer to as lease no 
between us and senior housing 
in consideration of our lease assumption  newseasons paid us million and transferred title to certain personal property located at the communities 
we recorded the newseasons consideration as a deferred credit on our balance sheet  which we are amortizing as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining lease term 
on august   we leased two senior living communities from senior housing until under our senior housing lease no 
described above 
as a result  our annual rent under that lease increased by million 
percentage rent  based on increases in gross revenues at these properties  will commence in on september   we leased eight senior living communities with a total of units until under our senior housing lease no 
described above 
as a result  our annual rent under this lease increased by million 
percentage rent  based on increases in gross revenues at these properties  will commence in on november   we leased one senior living community with a total of units from senior housing under lease no 
 which has a term expiring in as a result  our annual rent under this lease increased by million 
percentage rent  based on increases in gross revenues at this property  will commence in during  pursuant to the terms of our leases with senior housing  senior housing purchased approximately million of improvements made to our properties leased from senior housing  and  as a result  the annual rent payable to senior housing by us increased by approximately million 

table of contents rmr provides certain management and administrative services to us under a shared services agreement which is subject to annual review and approval by our independent directors 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our total revenues 
in may  the shared services agreement was amended to include compensation for personnel involved with management information systems  or mis 
rmr is compensated at a rate equal to of the employment expenses of rmr s employees  other than its chief information officer  actively engaged in servicing mis 
aggregate fees paid by us to rmr for management  administrative and information system services during  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly owned companies to which it provides management services 
our audit committee appoints our director of internal audit and our compensation committee approves his salary 
our compensation committee also approves the allocated costs we pay with respect to our internal audit function 
our pro rata share of rmr s costs in providing that function for the years ended  and was   and  respectively 
the fact that rmr has responsibilities to other entities  including our most significant landlord  senior housing  could create conflicts  and in the event of such conflicts between senior housing and us  our shared services agreement with rmr allows rmr to act on behalf of senior housing rather than on our behalf 
a termination of our shared services agreement is an event of default under our revolving credit facility 
rmr is beneficially owned by messrs 
barry m 
portnoy  one of our managing directors  and his son  adam d 
portnoy  who is president and chief executive officer and a director of rmr and a managing trustee of senior housing 
messrs 
barry portnoy and gerard martin  our managing directors  are directors of rmr 
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also officers and employees of rmr 
these officers devote a substantial majority of their business time to our affairs and the remainder to rmr s business which is separate from our business 
we believe the compensation we paid to these officers reasonably reflects their division of business time  however  periodically  these individuals may divide their business time differently than they do currently and their compensation from us may become disproportionate to this division 
an affiliated entity of rmr is the owner of the buildings in which our corporate headquarters are located 
these leases expire in we incurred rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during  and of million  million and  respectively 
this lease has been amended at various times to take into account our needs for increasing space and all amendments to this lease have been approved by our independent directors 
we  rmr and other companies to which rmr provides management services are in the process of forming and licensing an insurance company in the state of indiana 
all of our directors are currently serving on the board of directors of this insurance company 
we expect that rmr  in addition to being a shareholder  will enter into a management agreement with this insurance company  pursuant to which rmr will provide the insurance company certain management and administrative services 
in addition  it is expected that the insurance company and rmr advisors  inc  or advisors and a company affiliated with rmr will enter an investment advisory agreement pursuant to which advisors will act as the insurance company s investment advisor 
subsequent to year end  we have invested  to date in the insurance company and are committed to invest another  and we currently own and intend to own approximately of this insurance company 
we may invest additional amounts in the insurance company in the future if the expansion of this insurance business requires additional capital  but we are not obligated to do so 
over time we expect to transfer some or all of our insurance business to this company 
by participating in this insurance business with rmr and the other companies to which rmr provides management services  we expect that we may benefit financially by possibly reducing insurance expenses and or by having our pro rata share of the profits realized by this insurance business 
see item b of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding this insurance initiative and our part in this insurance company

our lease for this space expires in we incurred rent  which includes our proportional share of utilities and real estate taxes  under this lease during and of  and  respectively 
we believe that all transactions with all parties are on reasonable commercial terms 
we also believe that our relationship with senior housing and rmr benefits us and  in fact  provide us competitive advantages in operating and growing our businesses

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies concern revenue recognition  our assessment of the net realizable value of our accounts receivable  evaluation of goodwill and other intangibles  accounting for long term care contracts  our assessment of reserves related to our self insurance programs  our evaluation of impairment factors affecting our ars and other than temporary impairment considerations on our available for sale securities 
our revenue recognition policies involve judgments about medicare and medicaid rate calculations 
these judgments are based principally upon our experience with these programs and our 
table of contents knowledge of current rules and regulations applicable to these programs 
we recognize revenues when services are provided and these amounts are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
some medicare and medicaid revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment  and sometimes retroactive legislative changes 
our policies for valuing accounts receivable involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including consideration of the age of the receivables  the terms of the agreements with our residents  their third party payors or other obligors  the residents or payors stated intent to pay  the residents or payors financial capacity and other factors which may include litigation or rate and payment appeal proceedings 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable  we determine the amount of impairment loss  if any  by comparing the historical carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we determine estimated fair value through an evaluation of recent financial performance  recent sales of similar assets  market conditions and projected undiscounted cash flows that our asset or asset groups are expected to generate 
this process requires that estimates be made and errors in our judgments or estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements 
as a result of this test we determined to reduce the value of our long lived assets reported on our balance sheet related to our rehabilitation hospitals as of december  by million 
we review goodwill annually during our fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances exist  for impairment 
factors we consider important to trigger a review for impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained periods  or our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if our review indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  we reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which we determined to be the three segments we operate 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit as determined by its discounted cash flows and market approaches  such as capitalization rates and earnings multiples  with its carrying value 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow include future revenue growth  gross margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
we selected a growth rate based on our view of the growth prospect of each of our segments 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
recently  our market capitalization has declined and was significantly below book value during the fourth quarter 
as a result  we determined an interim impairment test was necessary and performed the interim test on all of our reporting units as of december  in our evaluation we weighed all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an impairment occurred 
as a result  we determined to reduce the value of goodwill reported on our balance sheet related to our pharmacies as of december  by million 

table of contents we routinely evaluate our ars to determine if they have been impaired and we expect to do so regularly until our ars are sold to ubs or are otherwise no longer owned by us 
if there is an indication that the carrying value of our ars is less than their estimated fair value  we record a loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we determine the estimated fair value of our ars by considering various factors including market prices  the ratings of the securities we hold and the credit characteristics of any guarantors of our ars 
we routinely evaluate our available for sale investments currently  such investments are carried only at our captive insurance companies to determine if they have been impaired and we expect to do so regularly 
if the book or carrying value of an investment is less than its estimated fair value and that that situation is expected to continue for a more than temporary period  we record an other than temporary loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we determine the estimated fair value of our available for sale investments by reviewing the current market prices of the securities  the ratings of the securities  the financial condition  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment and various other factors which we determine may be relevant to each security 
in evaluating the factors described above for available for sale investments  we presume a decline in value to be other than temporary if the quoted market price of the security is below the investment s cost basis for an extended period 
however  the presumption may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating the decline is temporary in nature  such as if the operating performance is strong  dividends are still being paid  or the market price of the security is historically volatile 
additionally  there may be instances in which impairment losses are recognized even if the decline in value does not fall within the criteria described above such if there is a plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below our cost basis 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we evaluate our put right enabling us to sell our ars at par value to ubs between june and june if there is an indication that the carrying value of our put right is less than its estimated fair value  we would record a loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we determine the estimated fair value of our put right by reviewing the ratings of ubs financial obligations and various other indications of ubs credit qualities 
the put right is recorded at estimated fair value under the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  no 
 the fair value option of financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas we calculated this value based on the difference between the fair value for the ars and the par value of the ars  which is the amount we expect to receive from ubs beginning june this value was adjusted for our estimate of a factor representing ubs counter party risks based on comparable credit default swaps for ubs as of december  at one of our communities  we offer continuing care contracts under which residents may pay admission fees in exchange for reduced charges during their occupancy 
these fees may be refundable or non refundable  or partially refundable and partially non refundable 
we record these fees as obligations on our balance sheet and amortize the non refundable amounts into revenue over the actuarially determined remaining lives of the individual residents which are the expected periods of occupancy 
actuarially determined remaining lives are estimates based upon general demographic samplings and averages 
our decision to amortize the non refundable fees over actuarially determined lives is based upon our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for that period 
the actual remaining lives and the actual period of occupancy of the individual residents who pay the non refundable fees may differ materially from these estimates 
in the future  if we find that such differences are material  we may change the actuarial tables which we use and we may change our estimates that these residents will remain at our facilities for these periods  these changes could have a material impact upon our financial statements 
determining reserves for the self insurance portions of our insurance programs involves significant judgments based upon our experience  including projected settlements for pending claims  known incidents which we expect may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  
table of contents claims experience  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
we also periodically receive and rely upon recommendations from professional consultants in establishing these reserves  however  these reserves may prove to be materially inaccurate 
some of our judgments and estimates are based upon published industry statistics and in some cases third party professionals 
any errors in our estimates or judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
in the future we may need to revise the judgments  estimates and assessments we use to formulate our critical accounting policies to incorporate information which is not now known 
we cannot predict the effect changes to the premises underlying our critical accounting policies may have on our future results of operations  although such changes could be material and adverse 
recently announced accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r  a replacement of fasb statement no 
 which changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the business being acquired 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r would also follow the provisions of sfas no 
r 
early adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
r is not permitted 
we evaluated the effect of the adoption of sfas r and have concluded that the effect on our financial position and results of operations will be  at a minimum  that we are no longer able to capitalize transaction costs for acquisitions 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  or fsp fsp requires an issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that is intended to reflect the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years and did not permit earlier application 
we evaluated the effect of the adoption of fsp and have concluded that it has no effect on our financial position or results of operation as our existing convertible instruments do not meet this criteria 
inflation and deflation inflation in the past several years in the united states has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
rising price levels may allow us to increase occupancy charges to residents  but may also cause our operating costs  including our percentage rent  to increase 
also  our ability to affect rate increases paid by the medicare and medicaid programs will be limited despite inflation 
deflation would likely have a negative impact upon us 
a large component of our expenses consists of our fixed minimum rental obligations to senior housing and hcpi 
accordingly we believe that a general decline in price levels which could cause our charges to residents to decline would likely not be fully offset by a decline in our expenses 

table of contents seasonality our senior living business is subject to modest effects of seasonality 
during the calendar fourth quarter holiday periods  nursing home and assisted living residents are sometimes discharged to join family celebrations and relocations and admission decisions are often deferred 
the first quarter of each calendar year usually coincides with increased illness among nursing home and assisted living residents which can result in increased costs or discharges to hospitals 
as a result of these factors  nursing home and assisted living operations sometimes produce greater earnings in the second and third quarters of a calendar year and lesser earnings in the first and fourth quarters 
we do not believe that this seasonality will cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating cash flow to such an extent that we will have difficulty paying our expenses  including rent  which do not fluctuate seasonally 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt  while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
for example based upon discounted cash flow analysis  if prevailing interest rates were to increase by  the market value of our million fixed rate mortgage debt and notes outstanding on december  would decline by about million  and  similarly  if prevailing interest rates were to decline by and other credit market considerations remained unchanged  the market value of our million fixed rate mortgage debt and notes outstanding on december   would increase by about million our revolving line of credit bears interest at floating rates and matures in may as of december  and february   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under our revolving credit facility require annual interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term  interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  if the maximum amount of million were drawn under our credit facility and interest rates increased or decreased by per annum  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  per year  or per share  based on currently outstanding common shares 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would occur over time 
in november  we entered into a non recourse credit facility with ubs secured by our investments in ars 
as of december  and february   million and million were outstanding under this credit facility 
we borrow in us dollars and interest payments under our non recourse credit facility will vary depending on the interest payable on the ars  but will not exceed libor plus basis points 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of any outstanding floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by and the amount outstanding under this credit facility remained unchanged from the amount outstanding on december  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  or about per share based upon our number of shares outstanding on december  the amount of money we may borrow under this ubs credit facility depends upon the market value of our ars 
because our ars are income securities  it is likely that the market value of our ars will be affected by changes in interest rates  as interest rates increase the market value of our ars might decline  and as interest rate decrease the market value on our ars should increase 
however  there are other factors which might impact the market value of our ars  such as supply and demand and 
table of contents liquidity  such that we do not believe the impact of interest rate changes upon the value of our ars and our borrowing capacity under the ubs credit facility can be precisely determined 
our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates may increase in the future if we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions or otherwise
