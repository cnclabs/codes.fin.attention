item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
all references herein to the term fiscal year shall mean a year ended march of the year specified 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its osplant systems equipment products  particularly the sale of niu products and related products 
the company introduced its first cns equipment products in fiscal the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal through its conference plus  inc subsidiary 
the company realizes the majority of its revenues from the north american market 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company revised its segment reporting structure to reflect the realignment of internal reporting of its equipment business 
this change split the former equipment segment into two separate reporting segments of cns equipment and osplant systems equipment 
in fiscal year  the company transitioned its internal manufacturing operations from aurora  illinois  to an outsourced model using offshore suppliers 
cns and osplant systems products were both manufactured in the aurora manufacturing facility and shared significant resources 
as a result  it is impracticable for the company to restate prior periods to conform to the current operating segments 
in order to provide information comparable to the prior year  the company has combined the cns and osplant systems equipment segments in the current year 
the company s cns equipment segment products enable high speed routing and networking of voice  data and video services in the home 
the products allow service providers to deliver services  content  and applications over existing copper  fiber  and wireless infrastructures 
the company s cns products are typically installed in consumer residences as a key component of a broadband service package 
the company s osplant systems equipment segment products consists of next generation outdoor cabinets  enclosures  power distribution  flexible edge connectors fiber  ethernet and coax  remote monitoring  ds and ds transmission plugs 
these solutions are optimized for wireless backhaul  service delivery to business enterprise and smart grid applications 
with its recent introduction of customized systems integration csi service  the westell osplant systems team now offers its customers a one stop shop for complete turnkey solutions  reducing the time to market and expenses incurred through third party contractors eliminating the need to design  assemble and test on the job site 
target customers include wireline service providers  wireless service providers  multiple system operators msos  utility providers and original equipment manufacturers oems worldwide 
the power distribution and remote monitoring products are designed and provided through the company s noran tel subsidiary located in regina  saskatchewan  canada 
the conferenceplus services segment is comprised of its subsidiary conference plus  inc conferenceplus 
during december  the company purchased the remaining minority interest in conferenceplus for million and as a result  conferenceplus is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
conferenceplus provides audio  web and video conferencing services 
businesses and individuals use these services to hold audio  web and voice conferences with multiple participants 
conferenceplus sells its services directly to large customers  including fortune companies  and also serves customers indirectly through its private label reseller program 
the prices for the products within each market group vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria  and are subject to change due to competition among telecommunications manufacturers and service providers 
increasing competition  in terms of the number of entrants and their size  and increasing scale of the company s customers because of past mergers  continues to exert downward pressure on prices for the company s products 
the company s customer base for its products is highly concentrated and comprised primarily of major us telecommunications service providers telephone companies  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to launch new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
the company has expanded its product offerings in the cns equipment segment from basic high speed broadband to more sophisticated applications such as voip  in premises networking  wireless wireline convergence  ip multimedia subsystem ims and fmc  and video iptv services 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which could adversely affect short term results of operations 
in view of the company s current reliance on the telecommunications market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in the cns equipment segment  the company is focusing on the evolving broadband demand  which includes increased bandwidth  richer application sets and converged capabilities 
the company has introduced products for both the existing local telephone and fiber network including the ultraline  proline and versalink  which are targeted at the home networking  and small business markets 
the company has started shipments of ultraline series  which primarily serves the home networking market 
the company is focusing on cost reducing these products  adding new features and functionality to create additional value in these products 
the osplant systems equipment segment has introduced products and services that focus on customer diversification and has changed from being a regional bell operating company centric provider into a provider with new sales channels including independent operating companies iocs  wireless service providers  msos  utility providers and oems worldwide 
the company acquired of the common stock of noran tel  inc on january  with the addition of noran tel  the company has obtained sales channels for some of its existing products  has added additional transmission products to offer in its existing sales channels and has gained new products in areas of power distribution and remote monitoring 
the company also plans to invest in new product areas to compliment wireless  fiber  and ethernet applications 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company decided to cease the operations of its westell limited entity located in basingstoke  england to increase efforts to focus on the core businesses of the company 
all employees have been terminated and the facility has been closed 
westell limited is shown as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
as previously disclosed  conferenceplus was informed by its second largest customer that the customer intends to transfer all business to another conferencing provider 
the transition by this customer occurred in the first fiscal quarter of and is substantially complete 
the revenue from this customer was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the conferenceplus segment has been impacted positively by the current economy as limited business travel increases conferencing call volume  but the lower overall employment market has negatively impacted the business 
the federal communications commission fcc has recently determined that audio and video bridging services are equivalent to teleconferencing services and are telecommunications under the telecommunications act of and the universal service first report and order 
due to this fcc ruling  conferenceplus must pay federal universal service fund fees fusf on applicable revenue for services provided on or after october  the fcc allows telecommunications companies to recover the cost of collecting  remitting and reporting fusf fees 
conferenceplus charges its clients an amount equal to what it must remit  plus charges an administrative fee to recover the cost of providing these services 
conferenceplus recorded approximately  of revenue for fusf related expenses  which are included in cost of telecom services  during the year ended march  in fiscal year  the company initiated a reduction in force relating to all three business segments in efforts to reduce costs 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company took further cost reduction actions that resulted in the termination of approximately employees primarily in the cns equipment segment and employees in the conferenceplus services segment 
the total cost of this restructuring action is estimated to cost   and  in the cns equipment  osplant systems equipment and conferenceplus services segments  respectively 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies that have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
inventory reserves the company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reserve for obsolete and potentially obsolete inventory 
the company also evaluates inventory valuation for lower of cost or market concerns 
prices related to future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into commitments for the purchase of inventory and long distance telephone services 
the commitments are at market rates 
should there be a dramatic decline in revenues the company may incur excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company has established reserves for potential losses on such commitments 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
goodwill and intangibles pursuant to the requirements of fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas no 
 the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at an interim period if indicators of impairment exist 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill of the reporting unit would be considered impaired 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss  the fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
an impairment charge of approximately million was taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal year at the westell inc reporting unit 
in fiscal  a million impairment was recorded at the noran tel reporting unit 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
revenue recognition  deferred revenue and deferred costs revenue recognition on equipment where software is incidental to the product as a whole generally occurs when products are shipped  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met  no significant obligations remain  collection is reasonably assured and warranty can be estimated 
due to the technological advances inherent in the telecommunications industry  the company must assess its revenue recognition policy as products technologically evolve 
in doing so for the ultraline tm series products  the company determined that embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole and therefore applied the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
currently  the ultraline tm series products are sold primarily to a single customer with contractual provisions that include specified future software enhancements and post customer support pcs to maintain ongoing interoperability within the customer s network 
although the product has been delivered to the customer  is installed and meets the customers current requirements  under sop no 
 multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into units of accounting when the following criteria are met the functionality of the delivered elements is not dependent on the undelivered elements  there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered elements have been met 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue and related direct costs are deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been delivered 
the company was not able to establish vsoe for the specified future software enhancements and therefore deferred revenue recognition on these products until all of the criteria under sop are met 
if the revenue recognition criteria for the specified future software enhancements has been met and the only undelivered element is pcs  the company intends to use the cumulative catch up method to record revenue and related costs equal to the total arrangement consideration less the portion applicable to the remaining pcs service period  which will be recognized pro rata over the remaining pcs service period 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation using the provisions of fas no 
r  share based payments fas no 
r 
fas no 
r requires the grant date fair value recognition of expense related to employee stock based compensations awards over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of equity based awards requires the company to estimate the expected volatility of its stock  the risk free interest rate  expected option term  expected dividend yield and expected forfeitures 
warranty costs most of the company s products carry a limited warranty ranging from one to three years for cns equipment segment products and up to seven years for osplant systems equipment segment products 
the warranty reserve is based on historical sales and cost of repair or replacement trends new accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued fas no 
r  business combinations fas no 
r 
this fas establishes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer a recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  b recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas no 
r is effective for the company on april  this statement applies prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the effective date 
earlier application is prohibited 
the adoption of fas no 
r will not have an immediate impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas no 

a noncontrolling interest  sometimes called a minority interest  is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent

the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
as the company does not have a minority interest as of march   the immediate impact of the adoption of fas will only affect presentation and disclosure  therefore  the adoption of fas no 
will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position fsp fas no 
and apb no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which increases the frequency of fair value disclosures to a quarterly instead of annual basis 
the guidance relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet at fair value

in april  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  which provides guidelines for a broad interpretation of when to apply market based fair value measurements 
the fsp reaffirms management s need to use judgment to determine when a market that was once active has become inactive and in determining fair values in markets that are no longer active 
it is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   but entities may early adopt the fsp for the interim and annual periods ending after march  the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements

 in thousands  except per share amounts revenue gross margin operating expenses income tax net income loss net income loss per common share basic diluted the quarterly fluctuations in revenue are due primarily to fluctuations in the cns equipment segment

the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
some factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include  but are not limited to  the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and profitability

the company entered into a credit agreement with the private bank and trust company dated as of march  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement is a one year asset based revolving credit facility in an amount up to million based on of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of of eligible inventory or million 
the obligations of the company under the credit agreement are secured by a guaranty from certain direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the company  and by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest at the greater of the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread of  or an alternative base rate 
the alternative base rate is the greater of prime rate or the federal funds rate plus the base rate 
the company is also required to pay a one time closing fee of  and non use fee of per annum on the unused portion of the revolving loans 
these fees are waived if the company maintains with the lender an average monthly demand deposit account balance of million and an average monthly investment balance of million

the company was in compliance with these covenants on march  in addition  although the company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future  the company s credit facility restricts the company s ability to pay dividends without bank approval
