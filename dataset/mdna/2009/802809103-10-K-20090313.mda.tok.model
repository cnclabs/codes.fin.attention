all accompanying tables  financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report should be considered an integral part of this analysis 
the corporation  similarly to other financial institutions  is subject to certain risks  many of which are beyond management s control  though efforts and initiatives are undertaken to manage those risks in conjunction with return optimization 
among the risks being managed are market risk  which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect the corporation s financial condition or results of operations  liquidity risk  which is the risk that the corporation will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet operating needs and financial obligations  credit risk  which is the risk that loan customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations  and operational risk  which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
in addition  the corporation is subject to legal  compliance and reputational risks  among others 
the corporation had counterparty exposure to lehman brothers  inc lbi in connection with the sale of securities sold under agreements to repurchase amounting to million at september  under a master repurchase agreement 
lbi was placed in a securities investor protection corporation sipc liquidation proceeding on september  the filing of the sipc liquidation proceeding was an event of default under the terms of the master repurchase agreement  which resulted in the acceleration of repurchase dates under the master repurchase agreement to september  this action resulted in a reduction in the corporation s total assets of million and a reduction in its total liabilities of million 
as soon as claims procedures have been established in the lbi liquidation proceeding  the corporation intends to file a claim for the amount of million  which is the amount it is owed by lbi  as a result of the acceleration of the repurchase date and the exercise by the corporation of its rights under the master repurchase agreement  plus incidental expenses and damages 
the corporation has recognized a claim receivable from lbi for million and has established a valuation allowance for the same amount since management  in consultation with legal counsel  believes that based on current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect the full amount 
the tax effect related to the recognition of this valuation allowance was a deferred benefit of million 
the corporation had a million floating for fixed interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge with lbi affiliate lehman brothers special financing inc lbsf

the corporation reported a net income of million for the year ended december   or per common share  a significant increase of million or over the net loss of million or per share reported for the year ended december  the increase in net income was principally due to increases in net interest income of million  a decrease in operating expenses of million and a decrease in provision for income tax of million  partially offset by an increase of million in the provision for loan losses 

table of contents return on average assets roa reflected an improvement of basis points to for the year ended december  compared reported for the year ended december  return on average common equity roe was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and  reflecting an improvement basis points 
the efficiency ratio on a tax equivalent basis also reflected an improvement of basis points to reach for the year ended december  from for the corporation s financial results for the year ended december  were impacted by the following the corporation recognized a provision for claim receivable of million which represents the excess of the value of the securities held by lbi above the amounts owed by the corporation under the securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the related tax benefit of this valuation allowance amounts to million 
the corporation experienced an improvement of basis points in net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  to for the year ended december  versus for  the provision for loan losses increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the increase in the provision for loan losses reflects the current recessionary cycle in puerto rico affecting the loan portfolio  including commercial and construction loans

the type of loans by net book value was million in construction loans and million in commercial loans 
no gain or loss was recognized on these transactions 
the common stock dividend for the year ended december  was per share resulting in a current annualized dividend yield of 
on august  the board of directors of the corporation determined to discontinue the payment of the quarterly cash dividend on the corporation s common stock to strengthen the institution s core capital position 
the corporation may use a portion of the funds previously used to pay as dividends to reduce its outstanding debt 

table of contents the corporation s principal source of revenues is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income represents approximately and of the corporation s total net revenues defined as net interest income plus other income for and  respectively 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
lending activities are one of the most important aspects of the corporation s operations 
the economic environment and uncertainties in puerto rico caused reduced lending activity and impacted the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio increasing the delinquency rates and charge offs 
the net loan portfolio  including loans held for sale  decreased billion  or reaching billion at december   compared to the figures reported at december  as of december   the allowance for loan losses reached million  reflecting an increase of million or  which includes million related to the bank portfolio and million related to the island finance portfolio 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to at december  from at december  although the corporation has diversified its sources of revenue  interest income from the loan portfolio continues to account for the majority of total revenues  representing and of total gross revenues for and  respectively 
as a result  the primary influence on the corporation s operating results is the demand for loans in puerto rico  which is significantly affected by economic conditions  competition  the demand and supply of housing  the fiscal policies of the federal and puerto rico governments and interest rate levels 
changes in interest rates  the corporation s principal market risk  can significantly impact its results of operations by affecting net interest income and the gains or losses realized on the sale of loans and securities 
as described under risk management  the corporation uses derivative instruments to hedge  to a limited extent  its interest rate risk in order to protect its net interest income under different interest rate scenarios 
broker dealer  asset management and insurance fees accounted for and of the corporation s other income and and of its total revenues for and  respectively

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of santander bancorp are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices within the financial services industry 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  in the application of its accounting policies about matters that are inherently uncertain 
management arrives at these estimates and assumptions  which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  considering the facts and circumstances at a specific point in time 
changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates 
detailed below is a discussion of the corporation s critical accounting 
table of contents policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
for a complete discussion of the corporation s significant and critical accounting policies refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion throughout this document which should be read in conjunction with this section 
current accounting developments effective january   the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements  for all financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis 
in february  the fasb issued a final staff position fsp fas that partially delayed the effective date of sfas for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
as such  the corporation did not adopt sfas for those nonfinancial assets and liabilities eligible for deferral under fsp fas and is evaluating the impact that this adoption may have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the corporation s financial position and results of operations 
illiquidity in the credit markets contributed to the amount of our reported level instruments  primarily in our trading and loan portfolios 
at december   the aggregate amount of instruments requiring fair value measurement on a recurring basis included in level represented approximately and of the aggregate amount of consolidated assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  respectively 
the amount we report in level in future periods will be affected by market conditions 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information related to the adoption of sfas in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  effective january   the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas provides an option for most financial assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
the election is made at the initial adoption  at the acquisition of a financial asset  financial liability or a firm commitment and it may not be revoked 
under the sfas transition provisions  the corporation has elected to report certain callable brokered certificates of deposits and subordinated notes at fair value with future changes in value reported in earnings 
sfas provides an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings as well as reducing the burden associated with complex hedge accounting requirements 
as a result of this adoption and the election under the fair value option  the corporation reported an after tax increase in opening retained earnings of million 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information related to the adoption of sfas fair value measurement 
the corporation s estimates of fair value for financial instruments are based on the framework established in sfas the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated willing parties  ie  not in a forced transaction 
the disclosure of fair value estimates in the sfas hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining such estimates and the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets  the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the corporation s market assumptions 
sfas requires the use of observable inputs when available 
additionally  the level at which a financial instrument is reported is based on the lowest level of any significant input into the estimation of fair value 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the corporation has the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severities  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect the corporation s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
the corporation uses quoted market prices  when available  to determine estimates of fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
when quoted market prices are unavailable  the corporation obtains fair value estimates from a nationally recognized pricing service that determines fair value estimates based on objectively verifiable 
table of contents information relevant market information  relevant credit information  perceived market movements and sector news 
the market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation  listed in the approximate order of priority  include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic events 
depending on the security  the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant 
for some securities additional inputs may be necessary 
the corporation reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the corporation s knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market 
the corporation will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value 
the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable  the corporation produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques  which  depending on the level of observable market inputs  will render the fair value estimate as level or level see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information related to valuation methods used by the corporation for each type of financial instruments that are carried at fair value 
the corporation employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments 
these control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied  and the assumptions are reasonable 
these control processes include validation and corroboration procedures over the quotes and prices obtained from brokers and counterparties  as well as reviews of the pricing models appropriateness by the personnel with relevant expertise  which are independent from the trading desks on a quarterly basis 
in addition  the corporation is considering recently executed comparable transaction and other observable market data for purposes of validating assumptions used in the models 
the corporation understands that any increases and or decreases in the aggregate fair value of its assets and liabilities will not materially affect its liquidity and capital resources 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation assesses the overall risks in its loan portfolio and establishes and maintains a reserve for probable losses thereon 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated loan losses based on the evaluation of known and inherent risks in the corporation s loan portfolio 
the corporation s management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is one of the most complex and critical accounting estimates the corporation s management makes 
the allowance for loan losses is composed of three different components 
an asset specific reserve based on the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended  an expected loss estimate based on the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  and an unallocated reserve based on the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific component of the allowance 
commercial  construction loans and certain mortgage loans exceeding a predetermined monetary threshold are identified for evaluation of impairment on an individual basis pursuant to sfas no 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when interest and or principal is past due days or more  or  when based on current information and events it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the asset specific reserve on each individual loan identified as impaired is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except as a practical expedient  the corporation may measure impairment based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated disposal costs  if the loan is collateral dependent 
most of the asset specific reserves of the corporation s impaired loans are measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by external valuation specialists and since these values cannot be observed or corroborated with market data  they are classified as level and presented as part of non recurring measurement disclosures 
a reserve for expected losses is determined under the provisions of sfas no 
for all loans not evaluated individually for impairment  based on historical loss experience by loan type  management judgment of the quantitative factors historical net charge offs  statistical loss estimates  etc  as well as qualitative factors current economic conditions  portfolio composition  delinquency trends  industry concentrations  etc the corporation groups small homogeneous loans by type of loan consumer  credit card  mortgage  etc 
and applies a loss factor  which is determined using an average history of actual net losses and other statistical loss estimates 
historical loss rates are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collections and charge off experience 
historical loss rates for the different 
table of contents portfolios may be adjusted for significant factors that in management s judgment reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that management considers in the analysis include the effect of the trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquency  charge offs  non accrual  changes in the mix or type of collateral  asset quality trends  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from internal and external agencies 
an additional  or unallocated  reserve is maintained to cover the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific component of the allowance 
this component represents management s view that given the complexities of the lending portfolio and the assessment process  including the inherent imprecision in the financial models used in the loss forecasting process  there are estimable losses that have been incurred but not yet specifically identified  and as a result not fully provided for in the asset specific component of the allowance 
the level of the unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions used in the calculation of the asset specific component of the reserve 
the underlying assumptions  estimates and assessments used by management to determine the components of the allowance for loan losses are periodically evaluated and updated to reflect management s current view of overall economic conditions and other relevant factors impacting credit quality and inherent losses 
changes in such estimates could significantly impact the allowance and provision for loan losses 
the corporation could experience loan losses that are different from the current estimates made by management 
based on current and expected economic conditions  the expected level of net loan losses and the methodology established to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers that the corporation has established an adequate position in its allowance for loan losses 
refer to the non performing assets and past due loans section for further information 
transfers of financial assets 
the corporation occasionally engages in transfers of financial assets and accounts for them in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

paragraph of sfas no 
provides that a transfer of financial assets in which the transferor surrenders control over those financial assets shall be accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
a transferor has surrendered control if all of the following conditions are met a the transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor put presumptively beyond the reach of creditors  even in bankruptcy  b each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received and no condition constrains the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange  and c the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either i an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or ii the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specified assets  other than through a cleanup call 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a gain or loss on the sale is recognized based on the carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
when the corporation transfers financial assets and the transfer fails any one of the sfas no 
sales criteria  the corporation is not permitted to derecognize the transferred financial assets and the transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing 
income taxes 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the corporation is required to estimate income taxes 
this involves an estimation of current income tax expense together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the determination of current income tax expense involves estimates and assumptions that require the corporation to assume certain positions based on its interpretation of current tax regulations 
the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
accordingly  the corporation reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the corporation recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
changes in assumptions affecting estimates may be required in the future and estimated tax liabilities may need to be increased or decreased accordingly 
the accrual for uncertain tax positions is adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the corporation s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to such accruals  including related interest and penalties  as considered appropriate by management 
when particular matters arise  a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by the taxing authorities and finally resolved 
favorable resolution of such matters or the expiration of the statute of limitations may result in the release of uncertain tax positions  which are recognized as a reduction to the corporation s effective rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences 
the carrying value of the corporation s net deferred tax assets assumes that the corporation will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  the corporation may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in 
table of contents additional income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowance from period to period are included in the corporation s tax provision in the period of change 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not  the corporation will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets related to santander financial services  inc and santander bancorp parent company only amounting to million and million  respectively  at december  accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances of million and million for santander financial services  inc and santander bancorp parent company only  respectively  were recorded at december  the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
accordingly  the corporation reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the corporation recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the corporation accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the reporting units are tested at least annually to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles may be impaired and written down 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if there is a determination that the fair value of the goodwill or other identifiable intangible asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
tangible and intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
if circumstances and conditions indicate deterioration in the value of tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives  the book value would be adjusted and a loss would be recognized in current operations 
the corporation uses judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
estimates of fair value are based on projections of revenues  operating costs and cash flows of each reporting unit considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
generally  the corporation engages third party specialists to assist with its valuations 
additionally  judgment is used in determining the useful lives of finite lived intangible assets 
changes in judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the purchase price allocations from prior acquisitions and the corporation s decentralized structure  goodwill is included in multiple reporting units 
due to certain factors such as the highly competitive environment  cyclical nature of the business in some of the reporting units  general economic and market conditions as well as planned business or operational strategies  among others  the profitability of the corporation s individual reporting units may periodically suffer from downturns in these factors 
these factors may have a relatively more pronounced impact on the individual reporting units as compared to the corporation as a whole and might adversely affect the fair value of the reporting units 
if material adverse conditions occur that impact the corporation s reporting units  the corporation s reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
the corporation s goodwill consists of million that resulted from the acquisition by the bank of banco central hispano puerto rico  million that resulted from the acquisition by santander securities of merrill lynch s retail brokerage business in puerto rico and million that resulted from the acquisition of island finance 
the value of the goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from the commercial banking segment  the wealth management segment and the consumer finance segment 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary be recorded as a write down in the consolidated statement of operations 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
the evaluation for potential impairment is inherently complex  and involves significant judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 

table of contents to determine the fair value of the reporting units being evaluated for goodwill impairment  the corporation uses the assistance of an independent consultant 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units acquired segments involves the use of estimates and assumptions including expected results of operations  an assumed discount rate and an assumed growth rate for the reporting units 
specifically  the independent valuation specialist prepared analyses regarding the fair value of equity of the corporation s reporting units  commercial banking  wealth management and consumer finance 
the consultant may use up to three separate valuation approaches market multiple approach provides indications of value based upon comparisons of the reporting unit to market values and pricing evidence of public companies in the same or similar lines of businesses 
market ratios pricing multiples and performance fundamentals relating the public companies stock prices equity or enterprise values to certain underlying fundamental data are applied to the reporting unit to determine indications of its fair value 
comparable transaction approach includes an examination of recent transactions in which companies involved in the same or similar lines of business to the reporting unit were acquired 
acquisition values and pricing evidence are used in much the same manner as the market multiple approach for indication of the reporting unit s fair value 
discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit using appropriate discount rates 
the discount rates are intended to reflect all associated risks of realizing the projected future cash flows 
terminal values are computed as of the end of the last period for which cash flows are projected to determine an estimate of the values of the reporting unit as of that future point in time 
discounting the terminal values back to the present and adding the present values of the future cash flows yields indications of the reporting unit s fair value 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  unanticipated competition  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  plans for disposition of a segment  among others 
as a result of the unfavorable economic environment in puerto rico  island finance s short term financial performance and profitability declined significantly during  caused by reduced lending activity and increases in non performing assets and charge offs 
the corporation  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  performed an interim impairment test of the goodwill and other intangibles of island finance as of july  sfas no 
provides a two step impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the corporation completed the first step of the impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets of island finance exceeded their fair value  thereby requiring performance of the second step of the impairment test to calculate the amount of the impairment 
based upon the completed impairment test  the corporation determined that the actual non cash impairment charges as of july  were million  which included of goodwill and million of other intangibles assets comprised of million of customer relationships  million of trade name and million of non compete agreement 
these impairment charges did not result in cash expenditures and will not result in future cash expenditures 
the corporation performed its annual impairment assessments as of october  with the assistance of the independent valuation specialist 
the corporation determined that no impairment charge was necessary as of october  based on management s assessment of the value of the corporation s goodwill at october   which includes an independent valuation  among others  management determined that the corporation s goodwill and other intangibles were not impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  the corporation must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the corporation may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
the key assumptions used by management to determine the fair value of the reporting units include company specific risk elements that are consistent with the risks inherent in its current business models for each reporting unit 
changes in judgment and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
pension and other postemployment benefits 
the determination of the corporation s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in healthcare costs 
management participates in the determination of these factors  which normally undergo evaluation against industry assumptions  among 
table of contents other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from the corporation s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
the corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for the determination of the pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
which requires recognition of a plan s over funded or under funded status as an asset or liability with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
actuarial gains or losses  prior service costs and transition assets or obligations will be subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs 
additional minimum pension liabilities ampl and related intangible assets are derecognized upon adoption of the standard 
in developing the expected return on plan assets  the corporation considers the asset allocation  historical returns on the types of assets held in the pension trust  the current economic environment  as well as input from the actuaries  financial analysts and the corporation s long term inflation assumptions and interest rate scenarios 
the expected rate of return for plan assets was set at for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and in selecting a discount rate  the corporation considers the moody s long term aa corporate bond yield as a guide 
at december   and  the discount rate was  and  respectively  for the corporation s plan and  and  respectively  for the bch s plan 
management believes that the assumptions made are appropriate  however  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect pension obligations and future expense

based on current and expected economic conditions  the expected level of net loan losses and the methodology established to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
commercial  construction loans and certain mortgage loan over a predetermined amount are individually evaluated for impairment  on at least quarterly basis  following the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting by creditors of a loan 
a loan is impaired when based on current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
substantially all of the corporation s impaired loans are measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated disposition costs 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by external valuation specialists and since these values cannot be observed or corroborated with market data  they are classified as level and presented as part of non recurring measurement disclosures 
the corporation maintains a detailed analysis of all loans identified as impaired with their corresponding allowances and the specific component of the allowance is computed at least on a quarterly basis 
additions  deletions or adjustments to the analysis are tracked and formal justification is documented detailing the rationale for such adjustments 
for small  homogeneous type of loans  a general allowance is computed based on average historical loss experience or ratios for each corresponding type of loans consumer  credit cards  residential mortgages  auto  etc the methodology of accounting for all probable losses is made in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in determining the general allowance  the corporation applies a loss factor for each type of loan based on the average historical net charge off for the previous twelve months for each portfolio adjusted for other statistical loss estimates  as deemed appropriate 
historical loss rates are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted based on changes in actual collections and charge off experience as well as significant factors that in management s judgment reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that management considers in the analysis of the general reserve include the effect of the trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquency  charge offs and non accrual loans  changes in the mix or type of collateral  asset quality trends  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses under sfas no 
is based on historical loss experience by loan type  management judgment of the quantitative factors historical net charge offs  statistical loss estimates  etc  as well as qualitative factors current economic conditions  portfolio composition  delinquency trends  industry concentrations  etc  which result in the final determination of the provision for loan losses to maintain a level of allowance for loan losses deemed to be adequate 
the corporation s methodology for allocating the allowance among the different parts of the portfolio or different elements of the allowance is based on the historical loss percentages for each type or pool of loan consumer  commercial  construction  mortgage and other  after assigning the specific allowances for impaired loans on an individual review process 
the sum of specific allowances for impaired loans plus the general allowances for each type of loan not specifically examined constitutes the total allowance for loan losses at the end of any reporting period 
an additional or unallocated reserve is maintained to cover the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific component of the allowance 
this component represents management s view that given the complexities of the lending portfolio and the assessment process  including the inherent imprecision in the financial models used in the loss forecasting process  there are estimable losses that have been incurred but not yet specifically identified  and as a result not fully provided for in the asset specific and general valuation components of the allowance 
the level of the 
table of contents unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions used in the calculation of the asset specific component of the reserve 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews its determination of the allowance for loan losses which includes the specific allowance computed according to the provisions of sfas no 
and the general allowance for small  homogenous type of loans  which is based on historical loss percentages for each type or pool of loan 
this analysis also considers loans classified by the internal loan review department  the internal auditors  the in house watch system unit  and banking regulators 
the corporation has not changed any aspects of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses  and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques  as compared to prior periods

experiential judgment in conjunction with statistical techniques are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting  product pricing  risk appetite  setting credit limits  operating processes and metrics to quantify balance risks and returns 
in addition to judgmental decisions  statistical models are used for credit decisions 
tolerance levels are set to decrease the percentage of approvals as the risk profile increases

the corporation uses an underwriting system for the origination of residential mortgage loans 
these loans are fully underwritten by experienced underwriters 
the methodology used in underwriting the extension of credit for each residential mortgage loan employs objective mathematical principles which relate the mortgagor s income  assets  and liabilities to the proposed payment and such underwriting methodology confirmed that at the time of origination application approval the borrower had a reasonable ability to make timely payments on the residential mortgage loan 
also the character of the borrower or willingness to pay is evaluated by analyzing the credit report 
we apply the basic principles of the borrower s willingness and ability to pay 
the risk involved with a loan decision is kept in perspective and must be considered in the analysis of a loan 
certain characteristics of the transaction are indicators of risk such as occupancy  loan amount  purpose  product type  property type  loan amount size in relation to borrower s previous credit depth and loan to value  cash out of the transaction  time of occupancy  etc 
risk will be mitigated  in part  by requiring a higher equity  risk pricing  additional documentation and obtaining and documenting compensating factors 
the purpose of mortgage credit analysis is to determine the borrower s ability and willingness to repay the mortgage debt  and thus  limit the probability of default or collection difficulties 
there are four major elements which  typically  are evaluated in 
table of contents assessing a borrower s ability and willingness to repay the mortgage debt and the property to determine it complies with the agency and investor s requirement  has marketability  and is a sound collateral for the loan 
the elements above mentioned comprised stability documentation  continuity and adequacy of income  credit and assets and collateral 
the corporation follows the established guidelines and requirements for all government insured or guaranteed loans such as fha  va  rural  pr government products  as well as conforming loans sold to fhlmc and fnma 
in addition to conforming loans and government insured or guaranteed loans  we also provide loans designed to offer an alternative to individuals who do not qualify for an agency conforming mortgage loan 
these non conforming loans typically have ltv higher than with mortgage insurance or additional collateral  the mortgage amount may exceed the fnma fhlmc limits and may have different documentation requirements 
commencing in late  the corporation adjusted the underwriting policies to take into consideration the worsening macroeconomic conditions in pr 
the implementation of more tight underwriting standards to reduce the exposure of risks  has contributed to a significant reduction of mortgage loans originations  and to improve the credit quality of our portfolio 
these underwriting criteria reflect the corporation s effort to minimize the impact of the local recession on its overall loan portfolio  including its mortgage business and protect the value of its franchise from the higher risk levels caused by declining assets quality

the corporation added strength to the control over its credit activities and does not pursue near prime or band c residential mortgage and consumer installment as a core product of its lending activities 
under the corporation s loss mitigation policy lmp  we evaluate  several alternatives for identifying near prime or band c residential mortgage loan borrowers who are at risk of default in order to design and offer loan mitigation strategies  including repayment plans and loan modifications to such borrowers 
the objective of the loss mitigation policy is to document the approach to loss mitigation manage and reduce the risk of loss for the consumer and mortgage portfolios and takes into consideration the current stress that consumer and mortgage borrowers are facing in puerto rico 
the corporation s strategy is to maximize the recovery from delinquent and past due consumer and mortgage loans by actively working with borrowers to develop repayment plans that avoid foreclosure or other legal remedies 
the policy applies to the corporation s consumer lending business  including personal loans  credit cards and credit lines and mortgage business including conforming  guaranteed insured mortgages and non conforming mortgages 
loss mitigation  where applicable  is intended to benefit both the corporation and the borrower 
the corporation avoids a costly and time consuming foreclosure process while the borrower maintains ownership of his her home 
the loss mitigation policy describes the corporation s approach to identifying borrowers with higher risk of default  assessing their ability to pay taking into account various factors  including debt to income ratios  assessing the likelihood of default  explore loss mitigation techniques that might avoid foreclose or other legal remedies and ensuring compliance with the appropriate regulations and policies of each regulatory or investment agency 
industry risk commercial loans  including commercial real estate and construction loans  amounted to billion as of december  the corporation accepts various types of collateral to guarantee specific loan obligations 
as of december   the use of real estate as loan collateral has resulted in a portfolio of approximately billion  or of the commercial loan portfolio 
in addition  as of such date  loans secured by cash collateral and marketable securities amounted to million  or of the commercial loan portfolio 
commercial loans guaranteed by federal or local government amounted to million as of december   which represents of the commercial loan portfolio 
the remaining commercial loan portfolio had million partially secured by other types of collateral including  among others  equipment  accounts receivable  and inventory 
as of december   unsecured commercial loans represented million or of commercial loans receivable  however  the majority of these loans were backed by personal guarantees 
in addition to the commercial loan portfolio indicated above  as of december   the corporation had billion in unused commitments under commercial lines of credit 
these credit facilities are typically structured to mature within one year 
as of december   stand by letters of credit amounted to million 
the commercial loan portfolio is distributed among the different economic sectors and there are no concentrations of credit consisting of direct  indirect  or contingent obligations in any specific borrower  an affiliated group of borrowers  or borrowers engaged in or dependent on one industry 
the corporation provides for periodic reviews of industry trends and the credits susceptibility to external factors 
government risk as of december   million of the corporation s investment securities represented exposure to the us government in the form of us treasury securities and federal agency obligations 
in addition  as of such date  million of residential mortgages and million in commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies through the small business administration sba and rural development programs 
furthermore  as of december   there were million of investment securities representing obligations of the commonwealth of puerto rico  its agencies  instrumentalities and political subdivisions as well as million of mortgage loans and million in commercial loans issued to or guaranteed by puerto rico government agencies  instrumentalities  political subdivisions and municipalities 
as of december   the corporation s credit exposure to the commonwealth of puerto rico and its political subdivisions and municipalities was million composed of million in municipalities loans  million in other government credit facilities and million in outstanding bonds and other obligations 
the corporation believes that the credit exposure to the commonwealth of puerto rico and its political subdivisions and municipalities is manageable 
the commonwealth of puerto rico has a long standing record of supporting all of its debt obligations 
it has never defaulted in the payment of principal or interest on any public 
table of contents debt 
the corporation s level of exposure is manageable given the fact that its outstanding loans and investment securities have either one or more of the following characteristics i investment grade rated counterparties  ii identifiable source of repayment  iii high ranking in repayment priority or iv tangible collateral 
the corporation has million on loans or obligations to various municipalities for which payments are secured by the full faith  credit and unlimited taxing power of the municipalities 
the corporation anticipates recovery of the amortized cost of these securities at maturity 
since the corporation has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  and the contractual term of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost  the corporation does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december

once a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest is recorded as income only to the extent of the corporation s management expectations regarding the full collectibility of principal and interest on such loans 
the interest income that would have been realized had these loans been performing in accordance with their original terms amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
non performing loans to total loans as of december  were  a basis point decrease compared to the reported as of december  non performing loans at december  amounted to million 
the corporation s non performing loans reflected a decrease of million or compared to non performing loans as of december  this change was driven by a decrease in non performing construction loans of million or due to the sale to an affiliate of certain loans  including some classified as impaired  during the year 
the reduction in non performing construction loans was partially offset by increases in non performing residential mortgage and commercial loans of million or and million or  respectively  when compared with the same in prior year 
repossessed assets increased million or to million at december   from million at december  as of december   the coverage ratio allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans increased to in from in excluding non performing mortgage loans for which the corporation has historically had a minimal loss experience this ratio is at december  compared to as of december  the accrual of interest on commercial loans  construction loans  lease financing and closed end consumer loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due  but in no event is it recognized after days in arrears on payments of principal or interest 
interest on mortgage loans is not recognized after four months in arrears on payments of principal or interest 
income is generally recognized on open end revolving credit consumer 
table of contents loans until the loans are charged off 
when interest accrual is discontinued  unpaid interest is reversed on all closed end portfolios 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that it is received 
the non accrual status is discontinued when loans are made current by the borrower 
potential problem loans as a general rule  the corporation closely monitors certain loans not disclosed under non performing assets and past due loans but that represent a greater than normal credit risk 
these loans are not included under the non performing category  but management provides close supervision of their performance 
the identification process is implemented through various risk management procedures  such as periodic review of customer relationships  a risk grading system  an internal watch system and a loan review process 
this classification system enables management to respond to changing circumstances and to address the risk that may arise from changing business conditions or any other factors that bear significantly on the overall condition of these loans 
the principal amounts of loans under this category as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
asset and liability management the corporation s policy with respect to asset liability management is to maximize its net interest income  return on assets and return on equity while remaining within the established parameters of interest rate and liquidity risks provided by the board of directors and the relevant regulatory authorities 
subject to these constraints  the corporation takes mismatched interest rate positions 
the corporation s asset and liability management policies are developed and implemented by its asset and liability committee alco  which is composed of senior members of the corporation including the president  chief accounting officer  treasurer and other executive officers of the corporation 
the alco reports on a monthly basis to the members of the bank s board of directors 
market risk and interest rate sensitivity a key component of the corporation s asset and liability policy is the management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for any given period  the pricing structure is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature or reprice in that period 
any mismatch of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is known as a gap position 
a positive gap denotes asset sensitivity  which means that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income  while a decrease in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income 
a negative gap denotes liability sensitivity  which means that a decrease in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income  while an increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the corporation s one year cumulative gap position at december   was negative billion or of total earning assets 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the corporation s position at any other time 
this denotes liability sensitivity  which means that an increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income while a decrease in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity strategy takes into account not only rates of return and the underlying degree of risk  but also liquidity requirements  capital costs and additional demand for funds 
the corporation s maturity mismatches and positions are monitored by the alco and managed within limits established by the board of directors 
the following table sets forth the repricing of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and may not be representative of interest rate gap positions at other times 
in addition  variations in interest rate sensitivity may exist within the repricing period presented due to the differing repricing dates within the period 
in preparing the interest rate gap report  the following assumptions was considered  all assets and liabilities are reported according to their repricing characteristics 
for example  a commercial loan maturing in five years with monthly variable interest rate payments is stated in the column of up to days 
the investment portfolio is reported considering the effective duration of the securities 
expected prepayments and remaining terms are considered for the residential mortgage portfolio 
core deposits are reported in accordance with their effective duration 
effective duration of core deposits is based on price and volume elasticity to market rates 
the corporation reviews on a monthly basis the effective duration of core deposits 
assets and liabilities with embedded options are stated based on full valuation of the asset liability and the option to ascertain their effective duration

nearly all of the corporation s interest rate risk arises from instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  investment securities  deposits  short term borrowings  senior and subordinated debt and derivative financial instruments used for asset and liability management 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the corporation analyzes on an ongoing basis the profitability of the balance sheet structure  and how this structure will react under different market scenarios 
in order to carry out this task  management prepares three standardized reports with detailed information on the sources of interest income and expense the financial profitability report  the net interest income shock report and the market value shock report 
the former report deals with historical data while the latter two deal with expected future earnings 
the financial profitability report identifies individual components of the corporation s non trading portfolio independently with their corresponding interest income or expense 
it uses the historical information at the end of each month to track the yield of such components and to calculate net interest income for such time period 

table of contents the net interest income shock report uses a simulation analysis to measure the amount of net interest income the corporation would have from its operations throughout the next twelve months and the sensitivity of these earnings to assumed shifts in market interest rates throughout the same period 
the important assumptions of this analysis are i rate shifts are parallel and immediate throughout the yield curve  ii rate changes affect all assets and liabilities equally  iii interest bearing demand accounts and savings passbooks will run off in a period of one year  and iv demand deposit accounts will run off in a period of one to three years 
cash flows from assets and liabilities are assumed to be reinvested at market rates in similar instruments 
the object is to simulate a dynamic gap analysis enabling a more accurate interest rate risk assessment 
the alco monitors interest rate gaps in combination with net interest margin nim sensitivity and duration of market value equity mve 
nim sensitivity analysis captures the maximum acceptable net interest margin loss for a one percent parallel change of all interest rates across the curve 
duration of market value equity analysis entails a valuation of all interest bearing assets and liabilities under parallel movements in interest rates 
the alco has established limits of million of nim sensitivity for a parallel shock and million of mve sensitivity for a parallel shock 
as of december   it was determined for purposes of the net interest income shock report that the corporation had a potential loss in net interest income of approximately million if market rates were to increase basis points immediately parallel across the yield curve  less than the million limit 
for purposes of the market value shock report it was determined that the corporation had a potential loss of approximately million if market rates were to increase basis points immediately parallel across the yield curve  less than the million limit 
the tables below present a summary of the corporation s net interest margin and market value shock reports  considering several scenarios as of december  net interest margin shock report december  in millions bp s bp s bp s base case bp s bp s bp s gross interest margin sensitivity market value shock report december  in millions bp s bp s bp s base case bp s bp s bp s market value of equity sensitivity as of december  the corporation had a liability sensitive profile as explained by the negative gap  the nim shock report and the mve shock report 
any decision to reposition the balance sheet is taken by the alco committee  and is subject to compliance with the established risk limits 
some factors that could lead to shifts in policy could be  but are not limited to  changes in views on interest rate markets  monetary policy  and macroeconomic factors as well as legal  fiscal and other factors which could lead to shifts in the asset liability mix 

table of contents derivatives the corporation uses derivative financial instruments mostly as hedges of interest rate risk  changes in fair value of assets and liabilities and to secure future cash flows 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details of the corporation s derivative transactions as of december  and in the normal course of business  the corporation utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  currencies and other markets  to meet the needs of customers and for proprietary trading activities 
the corporation uses the same credit risk management procedures to assess and approve potential credit exposures when entering into derivative transactions as those used for traditional lending 
hedging activities the following table summarizes the derivative contracts designated as hedges as of december   and  respectively december  other comprehensive notional gain income dollars in thousands amounts fair value loss loss cash flow hedges interest rate swaps economic undesignated hedges interest rate swaps totals december  other comprehensive notional gain income dollars in thousands amounts fair value loss loss cash flow hedges interest rate swaps fair value hedges interest rate swaps totals december  other comprehensive notional gain income dollars in thousands amounts fair value loss loss cash flow hedges foreign currency interest rate swaps fair value hedges interest rate swaps totals the notional amount represents the gross sum of long and short net of tax 
table of contents cash flow hedges the corporation designates hedges as cash flow hedges when its main purpose is to reduce the exposure associated with the variability of future cash flows related to fluctuations in short term financing rates such as libor 
at the inception of each hedge  management documents the hedging relationship  including its objective and probable effectiveness 
to assess ongoing effectiveness of the hedges  the corporation compares the hedged item s periodic variable rate with the hedging item s benchmark rate libor at every reporting period to determine the effectiveness of the hedge 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded currently as a derivative gain or loss in consolidated statements of income 
the corporation had a million floating for fixed interest rate swap designated as cash flow hedges with lbsf 
the derivative liability of this swap was  as of september  and was paid on december  as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lbhi and the default on its contractual payments as of september   the corporation terminated the swap and the cash flow hedge designation on these swaps 
the net loss of  was reclassified into earnings in the last quarter of as of december   the total amount  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income pertaining to the cash flow hedges was an unrealized loss of million 
economic undesignated hedges the corporation adopted sfas effective january  which permit the measurement of selected financial instruments at fair value 
the corporation elected to account at fair value certain of its brokered deposits and subordinated capital notes that were previously designated for fair value hedge accounting in accordance with sfas the selected financial instruments are reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported in consolidated statements of income 
as of december  the economic undesignated hedges have maturities through the year the weighted average rate paid and received on these contracts is and as of december  the corporation had issued fixed rate debt swapped to create a floating rate source of funds 
in this case  the corporation matches all of the relevant economics variables notional  coupon  payments date and exchanges  etc of the fixed rate sources of funds to the fixed rate portion of the interest rate swaps  which it received from counterparty  and pays the floating rate portion of the interest swaps 
the effectiveness of these transactions is very high since all of the relevant economic variables are matched 
the corporation had million fixed for floating interest rate swaps with lbsf 
the derivative liability of these swaps was  as of september  and was paid on december  as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lbhi and the default on its contractual payments as of september   the corporation terminated these swaps 
as of december   the corporation has million in fair value of these economic undesignated hedges 
fair value hedges the corporation designates hedges as fair value hedges when its main purpose is to hedge the changes in market value of an associated asset or liability 
the corporation only designates these types of hedges if at inception it is believed that the relationship in the changes in the market value of the hedged item and hedging item will offset each other in a highly effective manner 
at the inception of each hedge  management documents the hedging relationship  including its objective and probable effectiveness 
to assess ongoing effectiveness of the hedges  the corporation marks to market both the hedging item and the hedged item at every reporting period to determine the effectiveness of the hedge 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded currently as a derivative gain or loss in consolidated statements of income 
the fair value hedges have maturities through the year as of december  the weighted average rate paid and received on these contracts as of december  is and  respectively 
the million fair value hedges are associated to the swapping of fixed rate debt as december  the corporation regularly issues term fixed rate debt  which it in turn swaps to floating rate debt via interest rate swaps 
in these cases the corporation matches all of the relevant economic variables notional  coupon  payment dates and conventions etc 
of the fixed rate debt it issues to the fixed rate leg of the interest rate swap which it receives from the counterparty and pays the floating rate leg of the interest rate swap 
the effectiveness of these transactions is very high since all of the relevant economic variables are matched 

table of contents derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments any derivative not associated to hedging activity is booked as a freestanding derivative 
in the normal course of business the corporation may enter into derivative contracts as either a market maker or proprietary position taker 
the corporation s mission as a market maker is to meet the clients needs by providing them with a wide array of financial products  which include derivative contracts 
the corporation s major role in this aspect is to serve as a derivative counterparty to these clients 
positions taken with these clients are hedged although not designated as hedges in the otc market with interbank participants or in the organized futures markets 
to a lesser extent  the corporation enters into freestanding derivative contracts as a proprietary position taker  based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets 
the corporation had million of interest rate swaps with lbsf 
the derivative liability of these swaps was  as of september  and was paid on december  as a result of the bankruptcy filing of lbhi and the default on its contractual payments as of september   the corporation terminated these swaps 
these derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and  therefore  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these derivatives are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
the market and credit risk associated with these activities is measured  monitored and controlled by the corporation s market risk group  a unit independent from the treasury department 
among other things  this group is responsible for policy  analysis  methodology and reporting of anything related to market risk and credit risk

table of contents santander bancorp and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements years ended december   and summary of significant accounting policies and other matters the accounting and reporting policies of santander bancorp the corporation  a owned subsidiary of banco santander  sa santander group  conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america hereinafter referred to as generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and with general practices within the financial services industry 
following is a summary of the corporation s most significant accounting policies nature of operations and use of estimates santander bancorp is a financial holding company offering a full range of financial services including mortgage banking through its wholly owned banking subsidiary banco santander puerto rico and subsidiary the bank 
the corporation also engages in broker dealer  asset management  consumer finance  international banking  insurance agency services and insurance products through its subsidiaries  santander securities corporation  santander asset management corporation  santander financial services  inc island finance  santander international bank  santander insurance agency and island insurance corporation currently inactive  respectively 
santander bancorp is subject to the federal bank holding company act and to the regulations  supervision  and examination of the federal reserve board 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  income taxes  and the valuation of foreclosed real estate  deferred tax assets and financial instruments 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the corporation  the bank and the bank s wholly owned subsidiary  santander international bank  santander securities corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  santander asset management corporation  santander financial services  inc  santander insurance agency and island insurance corporation 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
effective january   santander mortgage corporation a formerly wholly owned subsidiary of the bank was merged into the bank and ceased to operate as a separate legal entity 
cash equivalents all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less  when acquired or generated  are considered cash equivalents 
securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase repurchase and resell agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at the amounts at which the assets will be reacquired or resold at the contractual maturity 
the settlement of these agreements prior to maturity may be subject to early termination penalties 
the counterparties to securities purchased under resell agreements maintain effective control over such securities and accordingly  those securities are not reflected in the corporation s consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation monitors the market value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable  including accrued interest  and requests additional collateral where deemed appropriate 

table of contents the corporation maintains effective control over assets sold under agreements to repurchase  accordingly  such securities continue to be carried on the consolidated balance sheets 
investment securities investment securities are classified in four categories and accounted for as follows debt securities that the corporation has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as securities held to maturity and reported at cost adjusted for premium amortization and discount accretion 
the corporation may not sell or transfer held to maturity securities without calling into question its intent to hold securities to maturity  unless a nonrecurring or unusual event that could not have been reasonably anticipated has occurred 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of operations as part of other income 
financial instruments including  to a limited extent  derivatives  such as option contracts  are used by the corporation in dealing and other trading activities and are carried at fair value 
interest revenue and expense arising from trading instruments are included in the consolidated statements of operations as part of net interest income 
debt and equity securities not classified as either securities held to maturity or trading securities  and which have a readily available fair value  are classified as securities available for sale and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale  which are included in gain loss on sale of investment securities in the consolidated statements of income 
investments in debt  equity or other securities  that do not have readily determinable fair values  are classified as other investment securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
these securities are stated at cost 
stock that is owned by the corporation to comply with regulatory requirements  such as federal home loan bank fhlb stock  is included in this category 
the amortization of premiums is deducted and the accretion of discounts is added to net interest income based on a method which approximates the interest method  over the outstanding life of the related securities 
the cost of securities sold is determined by specific identification 
for securities available for sale  held to maturity and other investment securities  the corporation reports separately in the consolidated statements of operations  net realized gains or losses on sales of investment securities and unrealized loss valuation adjustments considered other than temporary  if any 
derivative financial instruments the corporation uses derivative financial instruments mostly as hedges of interest rate risk  changes in fair value of assets and liabilities and to secure future cash flows 
all of the corporation s derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  the derivative may qualify for hedge accounting treatment and be designated as one of the following types of hedges a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variability of cash flows of a recognized asset  liability or forecasted transaction cash flow hedge or c a hedge of foreign currency exposure foreign currency hedge 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statements no 
 in the case of a qualifying fair value hedge  changes in the value of the derivative instruments that have been highly effective were recognized in current period consolidated statements of operations along with the change in value of the designated hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedge relationship was terminated  hedge accounting was discontinued and any balance related to the derivative was recognized in current operations  and the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continued to be reported as part of the basis of the item and was amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment 
the corporation hedges certain callable brokered certificates of deposits and subordinated capital notes by using interest rate swaps 
prior to the adoption of sfas as of january   these swaps were designated for the hedge accounting treatment under sfas  accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted sfas 
these financial instruments were accounted for as fair value hedges  with changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item included in other income and 
table of contents the interest included in net interest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with the adoption of sfas the corporation carries certain callable brokered certificates of deposits and subordinated capital notes at fair value with changes in fair value included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of funding of the corporation s borrowings  as well as derivatives  continues to be included in interest expense and income  as applicable  in the consolidated statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
in the case of a qualifying cash flow hedge  changes in the value of the derivative instruments that have been highly effective are recognized in other comprehensive income  until such time as those earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows of the underlying hedged item 
if the hedge relationship is terminated  the net derivative gain or loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedge should continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and would be reclassified into earnings when the cash flows that were hedged occur  or when the forecasted transaction affects earnings or is no longer expected to occur 
in either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  net earnings may be impacted to the extent the changes in the value of the derivative instruments do not perfectly offset changes in the value of the hedged items 
if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  the changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in consolidated statements of income 
certain contracts contain embedded derivatives 
when the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract  it is bifurcated  carried at fair value  and designated as a trading or non hedging derivative instrument 
loans held for sale loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market computed on the aggregate portfolio basis 
the amount  by which cost exceeds market value  if any  is accounted for as a valuation allowance with changes included in the determination of results of operations for the period in which the change occurs 
the amount of loan origination cost and fees are deferred at origination of the loans and recognized as part of the gain and loss on sale of the loans in the consolidated statement of operations as part of other income 
loans loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay off are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted for the allowance for loan losses  unearned finance charges and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans 
interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance 
loan origination fees  net of certain direct origination costs  are deferred and amortized using methods that approximate the interest method over the term of the loans as an adjustment to interest yield 
discounts and premiums on purchased loans are amortized to results of operations over the expected lives of the loans using a method that approximates the interest method 
the accrual of interest on commercial loans  construction loans  lease financing and closed end consumer loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due  but in no event is it recognized after days in arrears on payments of principal or interest 
interest on mortgage loans is not recognized after four months in arrears on payments of principal or interest 
income is generally recognized on open end revolving credit consumer loans until the loans are charged off 
when interest accrual is discontinued  unpaid interest is reversed on all closed end portfolios 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent that it is collected 
the non accrual status is discontinued when loans are made current by the borrower 
the corporation leases vehicles and equipment to individual and corporate customers 
the finance method of accounting is used to recognize revenue on lease contracts that meet the criteria specified in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
aggregate rentals due over the term of the leases less unearned income are included in lease receivable  which is part of loans  net in the consolidated balance sheets 
unearned income is amortized to results of operations over the lease term so as to yield a constant rate of return on the principal amounts outstanding 
lease origination fees and costs are deferred and amortized over the average life of the portfolio as an adjustment to yield 

table of contents off balance sheet instruments in the ordinary course of business  the corporation enters into off balance sheet instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit  stand by letters of credit and financial guarantees 
such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they are funded or when related fees are incurred or received 
the corporation periodically evaluates the credit risks inherent in these commitments  and establishes loss allowances for such risks if and when these are deemed necessary 
the corporation recognized as liabilities the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantees under the standby letters of credit issued or modified after december   net of the related amortization at inception 
the fair value approximates the unamortized fees received from the customers for issuing the standby letters of credit 
the fees are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the commitment period 
standby letters of credit outstanding at december  had terms ranging from one month to five years 
fees received for providing loan commitments and letters of credit that result in loans are typically deferred and amortized to interest income over the life of the related loan  beginning with the initial borrowing 
fees on commitments and letters of credit are amortized to other income as banking fees and commissions over the commitment period when funding is not expected 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a current estimate of the losses inherent in the present portfolio based on management s ongoing quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio 
estimates of losses inherent in the loan portfolio involve the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change in the near term 
the corporation follows a systematic methodology to establish and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology consists of several key elements 
larger commercial  construction loans and certain mortgage loans that exhibit potential or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  allowances are allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the corporation 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as defined by gaap 
any allowances for loans deemed impaired are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or on the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
commercial business  commercial real estate  construction and mortgage loans exceeding a predetermined monetary threshold are individually evaluated for impairment 
other loans are evaluated in homogeneous groups and collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans that are recorded at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value are not evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans for which the discounted cash flows  collateral value or fair value exceeds its carrying value do not require an allowance 
the corporation evaluates the collectivity of both principal and interest when assessing the need for loss accrual 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to individual review 
the loss rates are derived from historical loss trends 
homogeneous loans  such as consumer installment  credit card  residential mortgage and consumer finance are not individually risk graded 
allowances are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs for one year 
loss rates are based on the average net charge off history by loan category  market loss trends and other relevant economic factors 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when estimating the allowance for individual loans or pools of loans 
historical loss rates for commercial and consumer loans may also be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current condition on loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effect of the national and local economies  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs  non accrual and problem loans  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices  and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the corporation s internal credit examiners 

table of contents allowances on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge off experience 
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales  when control over the transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered the assets have been isolated from the corporation  the transferee obtains the right free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets  and the corporation does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity 
the corporation recognizes the financial assets and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred 
at the same time  it ceases to recognize financial assets when control has been surrendered and liabilities when they are extinguished 
in april  the bank transferred its merchant business to a subsidiary  mbpr services  inc mbpr 
the bank subsequently sold the stock of mbpr to an unrelated third party 
for an interim period that ended october   the bank provided certain processing and other services to the third party acquirer 
the gain on the transaction of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of as part of the transaction  the bank entered into a long term marketing alliance agreement with the third party and will serve as its sponsor with the card associations and network organizations 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization which is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets that range between three and fifty years 
leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease  whichever is lower 
gains or losses on dispositions are reflected in current operations 
costs of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of renewals and improvements are capitalized 
when assets are sold or disposed of  their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings when realized 
real estate held for sale the corporation owns certain real estate properties held for sale which are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
other real estate other real estate  normally obtained through foreclosure or other workout situations  is included in other assets and stated at the lower of fair value or carrying value less estimated costs to sell 
upon foreclosure  the recorded amount of the loan is written down  if applicable  to the fair value less estimated costs of disposal of the real estate acquired  by charging the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  any losses in the carrying value of the asset resulting from periodic valuations of the properties are charged to expense in the period incurred 
gains or losses on disposition of other real estate and related maintenance expenses are included in current operations 
goodwill and intangible assets the corporation accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the reporting units are tested for impairment annually to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles may be impaired and written down 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if there is a determination that the fair value of the goodwill or other identifiable intangible asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the corporation reviews finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the asset is determined to be less that the 
table of contents carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred in the amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operation expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the corporation uses judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
estimates of fair value are based on projections of revenues  operating costs and cash flows of each reporting unit considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
generally  the corporation engages third party specialists to assist with its valuations 
additionally  judgment is used in determining the useful lives of finite lived intangible assets 
changes in judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
the corporation has not adopted sfas for fair value measurement of goodwill and intangible assets pursuant to fasb staff position fsp fas effective date of fasb statement no 
issued in february as a result of the purchase price allocations from prior acquisitions and the corporation s decentralized structure  goodwill is included in multiple reporting units 
due to certain factors such as the highly competitive environment  cyclical nature of the business in some of the reporting units  general economic and market conditions as well as planned business or operational strategies  among others  the profitability of the corporation s individual reporting units may periodically suffer from downturns in these factors 
these factors may have a relatively more pronounced impact on the individual reporting units as compared to the corporation as a whole and might adversely affect the fair value of the reporting units 
if material adverse conditions occur that impact the corporation s reporting units  the corporation s reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights msrs represent the cost of acquiring the contractual rights to service loans for others 
on a quarterly basis the corporation evaluates its msrs for impairment and charges any such impairment to current period earnings 
in order to evaluate its msrs the corporation stratifies the related mortgage loans on the basis of their risk characteristics which have been determined to be type of loan government guaranteed  conventional  conforming and non conforming  interest rates and maturities 
impairment of msrs is determined by estimating the fair value of each stratum and comparing it to its carrying value 
no impairment loss was recognized for each of the three years in the period ended december  msrs are also subject to periodic amortization 
the amortization of msrs is based on the amount and timing of estimated cash flows to be recovered with respect to the msrs over their expected lives 
amortization may be accelerated or decelerated to the extent that changes in interest rates or prepayment rates warrant 
mortgage banking mortgage loan servicing includes collecting monthly mortgagor payments  forwarding payments and related accounting reports to investors  collecting escrow deposits for the payment of mortgagor property taxes and insurance  and paying taxes and insurance from escrow funds when due 
no asset or liability is recorded by the corporation for mortgages serviced  except for mortgage servicing rights arising from the sale of mortgages  advances to investors and escrow advances 
the corporation recognizes as a separate asset the right to service mortgage loans for others whenever those servicing rights are acquired 
the corporation acquires msrs by purchasing or originating loans and selling or securitizing those loans with the servicing rights retained and allocates the total cost of the mortgage loans sold to the msrs included in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the loans based on their relative fair values 
further  mortgage servicing rights are assessed for impairment based on the fair value of those rights 
msrs are amortized over the estimated life of the related servicing income 
mortgage loan servicing fees  which are based on a percentage of the principal balances of the mortgages serviced  are credited to income as mortgage payments are collected 
mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the gaap hierarchy 
the current gaap hierarchy  as set forth in the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement on auditing standards no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  has been criticized because it is directed to the auditor rather than the entity  it is complex  and it ranks fasb statements of financial accounting concepts  which are subject to the same level of due process as fasb statements of financial accounting standards  below industry practices that are widely recognized as generally accepted but that are not subject to due process 
the board believes that the gaap hierarchy should be directed to entities because it is the entity not its auditor that is responsible for selecting accounting principles for financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap 
accordingly  the board concluded that the gaap hierarchy should reside in the accounting literature established by the fasb and is issuing this statement to achieve that result

an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations is recognized when the decline in the fair value of the securities below their cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
the corporation considers various factors in determining whether it should recognize an impairment charge  including  but not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than its cost basis  expectation of recoverability of its original investment in the securities and the corporation s intent and ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment 
as of december  and  management concluded that there was no other than temporary impairment in its investment securities portfolio 
the unrealized losses in the corporation s investments in us and us government agencies and subdivisions were caused by changes in market interest rates 
all us and us government agencies securities are investment grade  as rated by major rating agencies 
the contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the face value of the investment 
since the corporation has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  the corporation does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  and the unrealized losses in the corporation s investment in mortgage backed securities were also caused by changes in market interest rates 
the corporation purchased these investments at a discount relative to their face amount  and the contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by an agency of the us government or by other government sponsored corporations 
accordingly  it is expected that the securities will be settled at a price not less than the amortized cost of the corporation s investment 
the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and since the corporation has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  the corporation does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  and 
table of contents contractual maturities on certain securities  including mortgage backed securities  could differ from actual maturities since certain issuers may have the right to call or prepay these securities 
the weighted average yield on investment securities available for sale is based on amortized cost  therefore it does not give effect to changes in fair value

these financial instruments may include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  financial guarantees and interest rate caps  swaps and floors written 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the corporation has in the different classes of financial instruments 
fin establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  requiring that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party  based upon a changes in an underlying asset  liability or equity security of the guaranteed party  or b a third party s failure to perform under a specified agreement 
the corporation considers the following off balance sheet lending related arrangements to be guarantees under fin standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit 
the fair value at inception of the obligation undertaken when issuing the guarantees and commitments that qualify under fin is typically equal to the net present value of the future amount of premium receivable under the contract 
the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending deposit related fees over the life of the guarantee contract 

the corporation s exposure to credit loss  in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written  is represented by the contractual notional amounts of those instruments

standby letters of credit outstanding at december  had terms ranging from one month to five years 
the contract amounts of the standby letters of credit of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  represent the maximum potential amount of future payments the corporation could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of non performance by all its customers 
these standby letters of credit typically expire without being drawn upon 
management does not anticipate any material losses related to these guarantees 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the corporation evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the corporation upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties and real estate

the corporation also adopted sfas on january  sfas allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract by contract basis 
the corporation elected to adopt the fair value option for callable brokered certificates of deposits and subordinated notes on the adoption date 
sfas requires that the difference between the carrying value before election of the fair value option and the fair value of these instruments be recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption 
additionally  sfas amended sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas  and  as such the corporation follows sfas in the determination of sfas fair value disclosure amounts 
the disclosures required under sfas  sfas and sfas have been included in this note

sfas also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market  as well as certain us treasury  other us government and agency mortgage backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over the counter markets 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange traded instruments  securities and derivative contracts and financial liabilities whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
this category generally includes certain mortgage backed debt securities  corporate debt securities  derivative contracts  callable brokered certificates of deposits and subordinated notes 

table of contents level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
this category generally includes certain puerto rico corporate debt securities  closed end funds  and certain derivative contracts

the estimated fair value was calculated using certain facts and assumptions  which vary depending on the specific financial instrument 
short term financial instruments short term financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  interest bearing deposits placed  federal funds purchased and other borrowings  commercial paper issued  accrued interest receivable and payable  certain other assets and liabilities  are carried at historical cost 
the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value of these instruments 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market 
trading securities trading securities are recorded at fair value and consist primarily of us government and agencies  us corporate debt and equity securities  puerto rico government  corporate debt and equity securities 
fair value is generally based on quoted market prices 
level trading securities include those identical securities traded in active markets 
if these market prices are not available  fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes  pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation 
level trading securities primarily include puerto rico government and open ended funds 
investments in puerto rico open ended funds are valued using a net asset value approach and can be redeemed at net asset value 
level trading securities primarily include puerto rico government and agencies debt securities and fixed income closed end funds 
at december  the majority of these instruments were valued based on dealer indicative quotes 

table of contents investment securities available for sale investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices  if available 
if quoted prices are not available  fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model based valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies  adjusted for the security s credit rating  prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions 
level investment securities available for sale include those identical securities traded in active markets  such as us treasury and agency securities 
level securities primarily include puerto rico government securities and mortgage backed securities 
other investment securities federal home loan bank fhlb stocks are recorded under the cost method of accounting 
there are restrictions on the sale of fhlb stocks  however they are redeemable at par 
the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value 
loans held for sale loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market 
fair values for loans held for sale are based on observable inputs  such as observable market prices  credit spreads and interest rate yield curves when available 
in instances when significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market  instruments are valued based on the best available data in order to approximate fair value 
this data may be internally developed and considers types of loans  conformity of loans  delinquency statistics and risk premiums that a market participant would require  and accordingly classified as level in a non recurring fair value measurement 
loans loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
as such  valuation techniques discussed herein for loans are primarily for estimating fair value for disclosure purposes 
however  any allowance for collateral dependent loans deemed impaired is measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and its estimated disposition costs 
the fair value of collateral is determined by external valuation specialists  and accordingly classified as level inputs for impaired loans in a non recurring fair value measurement disclosure 
the fair value for disclosure purposes are estimated for portfolios of loans held to maturity with similar financial characteristics  such as loan category  pricing features and remaining maturity 
loans are segregated by type such as commercial  consumer  mortgage  construction  and other loans 
each loan category is further segmented based on similar market and credit risk characteristics 
the fair value is calculated by discounting the contractual cash flows using discount rates that reflect the current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity 
fair values consider the credit risk of the counterparties
