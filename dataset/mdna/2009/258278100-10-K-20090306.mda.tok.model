overview we are a leading supplier of original equipment dealer exclusive automotive replacement parts  and fasteners and service line products primarily for the automotive aftermarket  a market segment which we helped to establish 
we design  package and market over  different automotive replacement parts including brake parts  fasteners and service line products manufactured to our specifications 
approximately of our parts and of our net sales consist of original equipment dealer exclusive parts and fasteners 
original equipment dealer exclusive parts are those which were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or salvage yards and include  among other parts  intake manifolds  exhaust manifolds  oil cooler lines  window regulators  radiator fan assemblies  power steering pulleys and harmonic balancers 
fasteners include such items as oil drain plugs and wheel lug nuts 
approximately of our products are sold under our brand names and the remainder is sold for resale under customers private labels  other brands or in bulk 
our products are sold primarily in the united states through automotive aftermarket retailers such as autozone  advance and o reilly  national  regional and local warehouse distributors such as carquest and napa and specialty markets and salvage yards 
through our scan tech subsidiary and dorman canada business unit  we are increasing our international distribution of automotive replacement parts  with sales into canada  europe  the middle east and the far east 

index during  there was a slowdown in overall global economic activity as well as instability in the financial markets 
these challenges have impacted the global economy  the capital markets  our operating costs and demand for our products 
the results of these challenges include continued higher material and oil related costs  a liquidity strain on some of our customers and suppliers  decreased consumer confidence and reduced consumer discretionary spending 
we expect these conditions to continue in the foreseeable future 
the credit markets have been volatile in recent quarters as well 
to succeed in this environment we are taking aggressive steps to further reduce all areas of cost  conserve working capital and control capital expenditures 
fortunately our balance sheet is strong and our revolving credit facility does not mature until june the strength of our balance sheet provides us with flexibility to expand or pursue attractive opportunities that may present themselves in these difficult times 
the automotive aftermarket in which we compete has been growing in size  however  the market continues to consolidate 
as a result  our customers regularly seek more favorable pricing  product returns and extended payment terms when negotiating with us 
while we attempt to avoid or minimize such concessions  in some cases pricing concessions have been made  customer payment terms have been extended and returns of product have exceeded historical levels 
the product returns and more favorable pricing primarily affect our profit levels while terms extensions generally reduce operating cash flow and require additional capital to finance the business 
we expect both of these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
gross profit margins have declined over the past three years as a result of this pricing pressure 
another contributing factor in our gross profit margin decline is a shift in mix to higher priced  but lower gross margin products 
both of these trends are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have increased our focus on efficiency improvements and product cost reduction initiatives to offset the impact of price pressures 
in addition  we are relying on new product development as a way to offset some of these customer demands and as our primary vehicle for growth 
as such  new product development is a critical success factor for us 
we have invested heavily in resources necessary for us to increase our new product development efforts and to strengthen our relationships with our customers 
these investments are primarily in the form of increased product development resources and awareness programs and customer service improvements 
this has enabled us to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow our revenues 
we may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by our customers 
generally  the second and third quarters have the highest level of customer orders  but the introduction of new products and product lines to customers may cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
we operate on a fifty two  fifty three week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  are all fifty two week periods 
acquisition and sale of assets in september  we acquired certain assets of the consumer products division of rockford products corporation consumer division for million 
the consolidated results for the period ended december  include the results of the consumer division effective september  we have not presented pro forma results of operations as these results would not have been materially different than actual results for the periods 
in connection with the purchase  we recorded million in contract rights which are included in other assets  and are being amortized over a year period 
on may   we sold certain assets of our canadian subsidiary for million 
we realized a million tax benefit upon the disposition of the business 
asset write downs and valuation allowances during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the value of the goodwill with respect to our canadian subsidiary hermoff as a result of a strategic review of the business 
as a result we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which represented the remaining goodwill balance at the subsidiary  in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we recorded a million charge to our provision for income taxes to provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of the subsidiary 
during the second quarter of  we assessed the value of the goodwill recorded at our swedish subsidiary scan tech as a result of a review of the scan tech business in response to bad debt charge offs of two large customers and the resulting loss of those customers in the first half of the year 
after completing the required analyses  we concluded that the goodwill at the subsidiary was impaired 
accordingly  an impairment charge of approximately million  which represented the entire goodwill balance at the subsidiary  was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we recorded a million charge to our provision for income taxes to write off deferred tax assets of the subsidiary which were deemed unrealizable 

index change in vacation policy effective december   we changed our vacation policy so that the current year s vacation time is earned ratably throughout the current year 
prior to december   all rights to the subsequent year s vacation vested to our employees on the last day of the previous fiscal year and the corresponding liability was recorded in that previous year 
since employees had vested all vacation time prior to the beginning of under the old policy  no additional vacation time was earned in and no expense was recorded 
this change resulted in a reduction in our vacation accrual of approximately million in as a result  vacation expense in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses was reduced during each of the fiscal quarters in results for the year ended december  include vacation expense reductions of million in cost of goods sold and million in selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r and related interpretations and began expensing the grant date fair value of employee stock options 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the tax effect of compensation cost recognized in the financial statements is classified as financing cash flows 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period during which employees perform related services 
the compensation cost charged against income for each of the years ended december   december  and december  was million  million and million before taxes  respectively 
the compensation cost recognized is classified as selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations percentage of net sales year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment income from operations interest expense  net income before taxes provision for taxes net income fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in revenues increased primarily as a result of higher new product sales and further penetration of existing automotive lines 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in the same period last year 
the increase is primarily the result of strategic investments to grow market share and higher material and shipping costs caused by higher commodity price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in the increase is the result of higher variable costs related to our sales growth and increased staffing levels in product development  engineering and quality control 
these increases were partially offset by incentive compensation expense which was million lower in than in the prior year due to lower earnings levels 
results for also include a million reduction in vacation expense due to the vacation policy change mentioned above 

index interest expense  net  decreased to million in from million in due to lower borrowing levels and interest rates 
our effective tax rate decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily the result of a million tax benefit realized upon the disposition of our canadian subsidiary 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in from million in revenues increased primarily as a result of higher new product sales and further penetration of existing automotive lines 
the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange and the acquisition of the consumer division accounted for approximately of the net sales increase 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in the same period last year 
the increase is primarily the result of a less favorable product mix  an increase in costs related to replacement and rework of defective products and higher product expediting costs 
a million decrease in our provision for excess and slow moving inventory partially offset the cost increases and the impact of the mix shift 
selling  general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in the increase is the result of higher variable costs related to our sales growth as well as our decision to invest more resources in engineering and new product development in results for also include a million reduction in vacation expense due to the vacation policy change mentioned above 
as noted above  we recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively  to write off goodwill of our canadian and swedish subsidiaries 
interest expense  net  decreased to million in from million in due to lower overall borrowing levels 
our effective tax rate decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily the result of lower goodwill impairment charges which were not tax deductible and  therefore  had no associated tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through a combination of cash flow from operations  accounts receivable sales programs provided by certain customers and through the issuance of senior indebtedness through our bank credit facility and senior note agreements 
at december   working capital was million  total long term debt including the current portion and revolving credit borrowings was million and shareholders equity was million 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million 
over the past several years we have continued to extend payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers which allow us to sell our accounts receivable on a non recourse basis to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment terms extensions 
as of december  and december   we sold million and million in accounts receivable under these programs and removed them from our balance sheets based upon standard payment terms 
we expect continued pressure to extend our payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable 
we have a million revolving credit facility which expires in june borrowings under the facility are on an unsecured basis with interest at rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points based upon the achievement of certain benchmarks related to the ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
the interest rate at december  was libor plus basis points 
borrowings under the facility were million as of december  we have approximately million available under the facility at december  the loan agreement also contains covenants  the most restrictive of which pertain to net worth and the ratio of debt to ebitda 
we also have outstanding million under a commercial loan granted in connection with the opening of a distribution facility which bears interest at payable monthly 
the principal balance is paid monthly in equal installments through september the loan is secured by a letter of credit issued under our revolving credit facility 

index our business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities  and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we have future obligations for debt repayments  future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancellable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letters of credit 
these obligations as of december  are summarized in the tables below in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term borrowings estimated interest payments operating leases these amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the underlying loan agreements 
payments related to variable debt are based on interest rates and outstanding balances as of december  the amounts do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt 
amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amount committed less than year years years after years letters of credit the company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities as defined in fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  due to the uncertainty of the amount and period of payment 
as of december   the company has gross uncertain tax liabilities of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we reported a net source of cash from our operating activities of million in the year ended december  net income  depreciation and a million increase in accounts payable were the primary sources of operating cash flow 
accounts payable increased primarily as a result of negotiated terms extensions with several of our suppliers 
inventory was the primary use of cash 
inventory increased million to support sales growth and increases in safety stock levels deemed necessary to enable us to better fill customer orders 
investing activities used million of cash in primarily as a result of additions to property  plant and equipment 
capital spending in consisted of tooling associated with new products  upgrades to information systems and scheduled equipment replacements 
financing activities used million of cash in the year ended december  the primary elements of our financing activities were million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the repayment of the final installment of million on our senior notes originally issued in we also repurchased million in common stock from our k plan during based on our current operating plan  we believe that our sources of available capital are adequate to meet our ongoing cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
foreign currency fluctuations in  approximately of our products were purchased from vendors in a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
however  recent declines in the us dollar have resulted in a number of material price increases 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value to foreign currencies in the future or the present weakness in the dollar continues for a sustained period of time  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase further 
the largest portion of our overseas purchases come from china 
the value of the chinese yuan has increased relative to the us dollar since july when it was allowed to fluctuate against a basket of currencies 
most experts believe that the value of the yuan will increase further relative to the us dollar over the next few years 
such a move would most likely result in an increase in the cost of products that we purchase from china 

index impact of inflation the overall impact of inflation has not resulted in a significant change in labor costs or the cost of general services utilized by us 
during the second and third quarter of we experienced significant increases in the cost of materials and transportation costs as a result of commodity price increases and weakness in the us dollar 
the upward pressure on materials and transportation costs eased somewhat in the fourth quarter as the us economy weakened  but costs are up over beginning of the year and prior year levels 
we have been able to offset a portion of these cost increases with higher selling prices  however  we do not expect to be able to do so completely 
as a result  cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased in the second half of and may increase further next year 
we will attempt to offset further cost increases by passing along selling price increases to customers  through the use of alternative suppliers and by resourcing purchases to other countries 
however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
related party transactions we have a noncancelable operating lease for our primary operating facility from a partnership in which richard n 
berman  our chief executive officer  and steven l 
berman  our president  are partners 
total rental payments each year to the partnership under the lease arrangement were million in and million in and during  we amended the lease with the partnership  which will now expire on december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  customer credits  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant percentage of our accounts receivable have been  and will continue to be  concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the united states 
our five largest customers accounted for and of net accounts receivable as of december  and december   respectively 
a bankruptcy or financial loss associated with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
revenue recognition and allowance for customer credits 
revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
we record estimates for cash discounts  product returns and warranties  discounts and promotional rebates in the period of the sale customer credits 
the provision for customer credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for customer credits are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold 
actual customer credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts for each period presented 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs 
we provide reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand  forecasted usage  estimated customer requirements and product line updates 
we maintain contact with our customer base in order to understand buying patterns  customer preferences and the life cycle of our products 
changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserves as needed 
goodwill 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we employ a discounted cash flow analysis and a market comparable approach in conducting our impairment tests 
earnings multiples of to times ebitda were used when conducting these tests in as a result of the impairment tests performed in and  we wrote off the goodwill of our canadian subsidiary hermoff and our swedish subsidiary scan tech  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 

index income taxes 
we follow the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes takes into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset takes into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no

s fair value measurement requirements for non financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
we adopted sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities on december   and there was no impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
for non financial assets and liabilities will have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
index our market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
substantially all of our borrowings as well as our accounts receivable sale programs bear interest rates tied to libor 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility and customer sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable  a change in either the lender s base rate  libor or discount rates under our accounts receivable sale programs would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds thereunder 
we experienced increased borrowing costs in the second half of as a result of increases in the discount rates under our accounts receivable sale programs 
these cost increases were caused primarily by the tight credit markets in the us during a one percentage point increase in libor or the discount rates on our accounts receivable sale program would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt and our accounts receivable financing costs by approximately million annually 
this estimate assumes that our variable rate debt balance and the level of sales of accounts receivable remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period
