in february  costar limited also acquired property investment exchange limited propex  a provider of commercial property information and operator of an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of investment property located in london  england 
in april  we acquired the assets of first cls  inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro  an atlanta based provider of local commercial real estate information 
the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section under the heading recent acquisitions 
in  we began our expansion into new metropolitan markets throughout the us  as well as expanding the geographical coverage of many of our existing us and us markets 
we completed our expansion into the new markets in the first quarter of in early  in conjunction with the acquisition of national research bureau  we launched a major effort to expand our coverage of retail real estate information 
the new retail component of our flagship product  costar property professional  was unveiled in may at the international council of shopping centers convention in las vegas 
during the second half of  to expand the geographical coverage of our service offerings we began actively researching commercial properties in new core based statistical areas cbsas in the us  increased our us field research fleet by adding vehicles and hired researchers to staff these vehicles 
in march  we signed a long term lease for a new research facility in white marsh  maryland  in support of our expanded research efforts and hired and trained additional researchers and other personnel 
we released our costar property professional service in the new cbsas across the us in the fourth quarter of in connection with our acquisitions of propex and grecam  we intend to expand the coverage of our service offerings within the uk and integrate our international operations more fully with those of the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 
we intend to eventually introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings 
in  we introduced the costar group as the brand encompassing our international operations 
we believe that our recent us and international expansion and integration efforts have created a platform for earnings 
in fact  our results for reflect growth in earnings as a result of these investments in our business 
our financial reporting currency is the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends 
we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long term 
we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes  as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods 
currency volatilities may continue  which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and comparisons 
we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services  expand existing services within our current platform  consider strategic acquisitions and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization 
for instance  in may  we released costar showcase  an internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals the opportunity to make their listings accessible to all visitors to our public website  www 
costar 
com 
in addition  in april  as described above we acquired the online commercial real estate information assets of first cls  inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro 
any future expansion could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable  driving overall earnings throughout and providing substantial cash flow for our business  it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
current general economic conditions in the us and the world are negatively affecting business operations for our clients and are resulting in more business consolidations and  in certain circumstances  failures 
as a result of the economic conditions  we have recently seen an uptick in customer cancellations  reductions of services and failures to pay amounts due us 
if cancellations  reductions of services and failures to pay continue to rise  and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers  our revenues will be adversely affected and our revenue may decline 
additionally  current conditions may cause customers to reduce expenses  when reducing expenses  customers may be forced to purchase fewer services or cancel all services 
we compete against many other commercial real estate information marketing service providers for business 
if customers choose to cancel our services for cost cutting or other reasons  our revenue could decline 
the extent and duration of any future continued weakening of the economy is unknown and there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the economy will be successful 
because of the current uncertainties in the economic environment  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue 
however  we continue to believe that the company is positioned to generate continued  sustained earnings through the end of we currently issue restricted stock and stock options to our officers  directors and employees  and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we plan to continue the use of alternative stock based compensation for our officers  directors and employees  which may include  among other things  restricted stock or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 
we incurred approximately million in total equity compensation expense in our subscription based information marketing services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional  and focus services currently generate more than of our total revenues 
costar property professional  costar tenant  and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment 
focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment 
our contracts for our subscription based information marketing services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are generally based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus  geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the year ended december   our contract renewal rate was over 
for the year ended december   our contract renewal rate was approximately 
as discussed above  our contract renewal rate may continue to decline if continuing negative economic conditions lead to business failures and or consolidations and further reductions in customer spending and decreases in the customer base 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets 
the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors  including the factors listed below significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we test for impairment 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually by each reporting unit on october st of each year for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we consider our operating segments  us and international  as our reporting units under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss 
we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda  which is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information marketing services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired trade names 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of net interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

on february   costar limited acquired property investment exchange limited propex  a provider of web based commercial property information and operator of an electronic platform that facilitates the exchange of investment property in the uk propex s suite of electronic platforms and listing websites give users access to the uk commercial property investment and leasing markets 
costar limited acquired all outstanding capital stock of propex for approximately million  consisting of cash  deferred consideration and  shares of costar common stock 
first cls  inc on april   we acquired certain assets of first cls  inc doing business as the dorey companies and doreypro  an atlanta based provider of local commercial real estate information for million in initial cash consideration and deferred consideration payable within approximately six months of the one year anniversary of closing 
accounting treatment 
these acquisitions were accounted for using purchase accounting 
the purchase price for the propex acquisition was primarily allocated to acquired customer base  trade names  and goodwill 
the purchase price for the first cls  inc acquisition was primarily allocated to acquired customer base 
the acquired customer base for the acquisitions  which consists of one distinct intangible asset for each acquisition and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on a declining balance method over ten years 
the propex acquired trade name is being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
we recorded goodwill of approximately million for the propex acquisition and million for the first cls  inc acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of propex and first cls  inc have been consolidated with those of the company since the respective dates of the acquisitions and are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  pro forma financial information has not been presented for either acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the year ended december  was primarily due to net cash from operating activities of approximately million partially offset by the reclassification of approximately million par value auction rate securities ars from short term investments to long term investments in the first quarter of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to approximately million decreased cash receipts on accounts receivable due to increased balances and declining economic conditions and increased payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million which included the million payment of deferred consideration for the propex acquisition  approximately  in payments for a propex data agreement  and payment of approximately million in value added taxes related to the lease settlement 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the decision to invest in money market funds and us treasuries instead of short term investment instruments  which resulted in a net sale of investments of approximately million in the year ended december  compared to a net purchase of investments of approximately million in the year ended december  in addition  we used million in cash as initial consideration for the purchase of first cls  inc in the year ended december   as compared to million in cash consideration used for the acquisition of propex in the year ended december  we also purchased approximately million less in property  equipment and other assets during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the higher net cash provided by financing activities in compared to is due to an increase in excess tax benefits from stock options partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total and thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total contractual principal cash obligations amounts do not include i contracts with initial terms of twelve months or less  or ii multi year contracts that may be terminated by a third party or us 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million 
we expect to make capital expenditures in of approximately million to million 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we expect to use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
in april  we paid million in initial cash consideration and made a commitment for deferred consideration payable within approximately six months of the one year anniversary of closing for the online commercial real estate information assets of first cls  inc  an atlanta based provider of local commercial real estate information 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of december   we had million of long term investments in student loan ars  which failed to settle at auctions 
the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education

we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
