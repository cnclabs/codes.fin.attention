item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts   as of january   for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and for disputed claims and quality issues 
if the financial condition of any of the customers of the company were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
as of january   the company has  accrued for inventory obsolescence and market reserves 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
see the comparison of to metals segment below 
as noted in note f to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company has accrued  as of january   in environmental remediation costs which  in management s best estimate  are expected to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as outlined in note f 
expenditures related to costs currently accrued are not discounted to their present values and are expected to be made over the next three to four years 
however  as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and necessary remediation of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
changes in information known to management or in applicable regulations may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
the company also reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when the future undiscounted cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the asset  the assets are written down to fair value 
based on assessments performed in on the assets of the company  no write downs were deemed necessary 
the company also reviews the  of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter utilizing applicable fair value measurements and based on its review in  concluded that no impairment charges were necessary 
the company believes that if impairment charges should occur with respect to its existing assets  the charges would not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  if business conditions at any of the plant sites were to deteriorate to an extent where cash flows and other impairment measurements indicated values for the related long lived assets  including goodwill  were less than the carrying values of those assets  significant impairment charges could be necessary 
based on the closing price of the company s common stock at january   the aggregate market value of the company was significantly below the consolidated book value of the company at january  as a result  the company also estimated the fair value of all of the other reporting units in the company  and compared the result to the aggregate market capitalization in order to ensure that the reporting unit with the goodwill was not overvalued

table of contents commodity pipe unit volumes increased percent in the fourth quarter of resulting in a three percent increase for the year compared to the same period last year 
the increase in commodity volumes reflects the apparent benefit that the unfair trade case  filed in january by us producers of stainless steel pipe and the united steelworkers union against china  had on imports over the last three quarters of  coupled with the very low volume experienced in s fourth quarter 
gross profits are impacted by stainless steel surcharges which are assessed each month by the stainless steel producers to cover the change in their costs of certain raw materials 
the company  in turn  passes on the surcharge in the sales prices charged to its customers 
under the company s first in first out fifo inventory method  cost of goods sold is charged for the surcharges that were in effect three or more months prior to the month of sale 
accordingly  if surcharges are in an upward trend  reported profits will benefit 
conversely  when surcharges go down  profits are reduced 
unfortunately  stainless steel surcharges began a decline in the third quarter of which accelerated in the fourth quarter of which reduced profits significantly 
this decline created steady downward pressure on commodity selling prices causing average selling prices to fall percent in the fourth quarter of and percent for the year compared to the same periods in this resulted in an approximately  loss in the fourth quarter of under our fifo inventory method that matched the low selling prices with much higher inventory costs 
the rapid decline in commodity pricing also created an inventory valuation issue at year end as the market value of much of our commodity inventory fell below our costs  which led to an approximate  charge in the fourth quarter of to reduce the january  inventory value to market prices 
the non commodity business continued to deliver excellent results 
although unit volumes fell percent for the year and percent in the fourth quarter of  average selling prices increased percent for the year and percent for the quarter compared to the same periods in the majority of the decline in unit volumes came in our piping systems operation as customers pushed out delivery dates in the fourth quarter of in response to the economic downturn 
the increase in average selling prices came primarily from a change in product mix 
as a result  the non commodity business generated excellent gross profits for the year and in the fourth quarter of piping systems backlog was  at the end of the fourth quarter of compared to  at the end of the third quarter of and  at the end of the fourth quarter of selling and administrative expense decreased  or six percent in when compared to  but remained unchanged at four percent of sales in consistent with the dollar decrease came primarily from decreased management incentives  which are based on profits  offset somewhat by an increase in sales commission expense  resulting from the increase in sales in compared to comparison of to metals segment the metals segment achieved sales growth of percent for from a percent increase in average selling prices  partially offset by a percent decline in unit volumes when compared to operating income of  was percent higher than s total of  the large increases in average selling prices resulted partly from higher stainless steel surcharges  primarily in the first three quarters of  compared to the increased selling prices resulted from our accomplishing our goal of expanding into markets that require larger pipe sizes  higher priced alloys  larger proportions of non commodity products  and products fabricated by our piping systems plant 
the change in product mix includes the successful development of business from liquid natural gas lng  wastewater and water treatment  biofuels and electric utility scrubber projects 
many of the products produced for these markets are subject to more stringent specifications  including percent x ray of the weld seams 
in addition  some of these non commodity products are made from expensive alloys and are more difficult to produce 
accordingly  their cost and sales price are much higher than commodity products 
the decline in unit volume for as compared to resulted from a percent decline in pipe sales  partially offset by a percent increase in piping systems 
the increase in gross profit was more than accounted for by a surge in our piping systems products to more than triple the amounts earned in  while pipe sales yielded slightly lower profits 
during the first six months of  the company continued to experience an upward trend in surcharges experienced in the third and fourth quarters of as a result  surcharges were significantly higher than they were in the first six months of with an accompanying benefit to gross profits 
over the last six months of  surcharges declined reducing gross profits 
sales for the fourth quarter of declined percent from a percent decline in unit volumes  partially offset by a percent increase in average selling prices  while operating income declined percent to  for the fourth quarter of  compared to  in the fourth quarter of the decrease in unit volume experienced in the fourth quarter of resulted from a percent decline in commodity pipe sales  partially 
table of contents offset by percent higher piping systems unit volumes compared to the fourth quarter of weak market conditions that began in the third quarter of deteriorated further in the fourth quarter of causing the big unit volume decrease in pipe sales 
stainless steel surcharges in declined significantly in august  september and october  and although nickel prices rose in november and december  they flattened in january and fell in february this uncertainty of nickel pricing along with distributors desire to reduce inventories at year end caused distributors to limit purchases throughout the fourth quarter of another factor causing the volume declines for the year and fourth quarter of when compared to the same periods of was the significant increase in imports  primarily from china 
finally  the weakening of end use demand for commodity pipe experienced toward the end of the third quarter of accelerated in the fourth quarter of although our non commodity business in the fourth quarter of was strong  it was not enough to offset the negative impact on profitability from the lower than expected commodity pipe sales which generated substantial under absorption of fixed and overhead costs 
piping systems continued to experience the favorable impact of its strong backlog as operating income increased significantly in the fourth quarter of compared to a year earlier 
piping systems backlog was  at the end of compared to  at the end selling and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  but remained unchanged at four percent of sales in consistent with the dollar increase came primarily from increased management incentives  which are based on profits  and sales commissions  resulting from the increase in sales in compared to specialty chemicals segment the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated

operating income declined percent to  for the fourth quarter of compared to  for the fourth quarter of the increase in revenues in came primarily from adding new products during the year  together with increased selling prices of our basic chemical products to pass on some of the higher raw material and energy related costs 
the declines in gross profit and operating income for the year and fourth quarter of  when compared to the same periods in  were caused primarily by our inability to pass on all of the increases in raw material and energy related costs 
gross profits in were also negatively impacted by higher than expected start up costs from several of the new products added in we also had approximately  in claims and the write down of inventories to reflect obsolescence and market valuation issues that negatively impacted the fourth quarter of selling and administrative expense decreased  or six percent in compared to the amount  and decreased to six percent of sales in from eight percent of sales in the decrease resulted primarily from reduced selling expenses primarily in the op operation 

table of contents comparison of to specialty chemicals segment the specialty chemicals segment sales increased six percent for the year ended and percent in the fourth quarter of compared to the same periods of the increase in revenues in resulted primarily from adding several new products during the year  an increase in demand for our contract manufacturing products  and increased selling prices on our basic chemical products to pass on higher energy related costs

current conditions and outlook management of the specialty chemicals segment was successful in increasing revenues in reflecting efforts to generate new products  improve existing products  and compete in markets not as susceptible to foreign imports 
unfortunately  higher petroleum costs drove up raw material and energy costs which hurt profitability 
if the recent decline in oil and natural gas prices continues into the future  our costs of raw materials and energy costs should decline  which would help profitability 
on march   the company entered into a purchase agreement to sell the pigment dispersion business of op 
the sale includes substantially all of op s assets for a purchase price approximately equal to their net book value as of the date of sale  and any gain or loss resulting from the disposition will not be material 
as part of the agreement  the company will continue to toll manufacture pigments for a transitional period of up to one year 
op will continue to produce and sell chemical dispersions utilizing some of its existing equipment  and is attempting to introduce new chemical dispersions directed at the latex and rubber industries  as well as other selected targeted customers 
management believes that divesting the pigment dispersion business will free up resources and working capital allowing the specialty chemicals segment to focus on activities more in line with the remaining specialty chemicals operations 
although management is confident it is positioned to compete effectively  current economic conditions make operating performance in uncertain 
as a result of the significant increases in stainless steel pipe imported from china  the metals segment along with three other us producers of stainless steel pipe and the united steelworkers union filed an unfair trade case against china on january  it is the third case involving pipe and tube imports from china filed since early the us department of commerce doc findings have supported petitioners in all three cases  and it has issued final determinations on welded stainless steel pipe 
on january   it announced its determination of duties ranging from percent to over percent on stainless steel welded pipe smaller than inches in diameter imported from china 
the international trade commission itc had its final vote in late february and will issue its final ruling in march 
as discussed above  based on activity over the last three quarters  we believe the actions by the itc and the doc have already reduced import activity and have had a positive influence on demand for domestic producers 
this is encouraging  but  until this trade case is finalized  it will add uncertainty to the future results from commodity pipe 
this positive impact on commodity pipe volumes has been offset by falling stainless steel prices which  along with the uncertainty of the economy  have caused distributors to limit stocking of inventories 
although stainless steel surcharges appear to have stabilized so far in  the significant declines experienced in the fourth quarter of have created a poor pricing environment for our commodity 
table of contents pipe  which will negatively impact profitability in the first quarter of it is possible that the stimulus spending by the federal government will fund increased activity in the water and waste water treatment area  which is a significant part of our piping systems business 
however  the impact from current economic conditions both domestically and world wide makes it difficult to predict the performance of this segment for in spite of this  management continues to be optimistic about the piping systems business over the long term based on our current bidding activity for projects and our strong backlog  with over percent of the backlog coming from energy and water and wastewater treatment projects 
the backlog was  at the end of the fourth quarter of of which approximately percent should be completed in management also believes we are the largest and most capable domestic producer of non commodity stainless pipe and an effective producer of commodity stainless pipe which should serve the company well in the long term 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates 
in this regard  changes in u 
s 
interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its indebtedness 
except as described below  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
fair value of the company s debt obligations  which approximated the recorded value  consisted of at january   under a  line of credit and term loan agreement expiring december  with a variable interest rate of percent 
at december   under a  line of credit and term loan agreement expiring december  with a variable interest rate of percent 
the company periodically utilizes derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related pronouncements 
cash flow and fair value hedges are hedges that are intended to eliminate the risk of changes in the fair values of assets  liabilities and certain types of firm commitments 
the company s objective in using these instruments is to help protect its earnings and cash flows from interest rate risks on its long term indebtedness and fluctuations in the fair value of commodities used in the company s stainless steel raw materials 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
in this documentation  the company specifically identifies the asset  liability and non cancelable commitment that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to that item 
the company formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis 
the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires  when it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur  when a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or when management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
cash flow hedges are hedges that use derivatives to offset the variability of expected future cash flows 
variability can appear in floating rate liabilities and can arise from changes in interest rates 
the company uses an interest rate swap in which it pays a fixed rate of interest while receiving a variable rate of interest to change the cash flow profile of its variable rate borrowing to match a fixed rate profile 
as discussed in note d to the consolidated financial statements  the company entered into a long term debt agreement with its bank and pays interest based on a variable interest rate 
to mitigate the variability of the interest rate risk  the company entered into a derivative swap contract in february of with the bank  coupled with a third party who will pay a variable rate of interest an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of  pursuant to which the company receives interest at libor and pays interest at a fixed interest rate of percent  and runs from march  to december   which equates to the final payment amount and due date of the term loan 
although the swap is expected to effectively offset variable interest in the borrowing  hedge accounting is not 
table of contents utilized 
therefore  changes in its fair value are being recorded in current assets or liabilities  as appropriate  with corresponding offsetting entries to other expense 
in the ordinary course of business  the company s income and cash flows may be affected by fluctuations in the price of nickel  which is a component of stainless steel raw materials used in its production of stainless steel pipe 
the company is subject to raw material surcharges on the nickel component from its stainless steel suppliers 
for certain non cancelable fixed price sales contracts having delivery dates in the future  the company is not able to obtain fixed price purchase commitments to cover the nickel surcharge component of the stainless steel raw material requirements of the sales contract which creates a cost exposure from fluctuations in the nickel surcharges 
where such exposure exists  the company considers the use of cash settled commodity price swaps with durations approximately equal to the expected delivery dates of the applicable raw materials to hedge the price of its nickel requirements 
the company designates these instruments as fair value hedges and the resulting changes in their fair value are recorded as inventory costs 
subsequent gains and losses are recognized in cost of products sold in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
while these hedging activities may protect the company against higher nickel prices  they may also prevent realizing possible lower raw material costs in the event that the market price of nickel falls below the price stated in a forward sale or futures contract 
there were no outstanding hedging contracts on nickel commodities at january  or december
