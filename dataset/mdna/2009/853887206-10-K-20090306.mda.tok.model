references to   and refer to the week periods ended december   december   and december  overview the company we are a leading document services provider that partners with our customers to manage  control  and source their document and print related spending 
we primarily serve the healthcare  industrial  and commercial markets 
we are trusted by our customers to manage business critical documents 
managing these documents not only includes providing printed documents but also includes helping companies migrate from paper based to digital processes by providing innovative tools to manage the entire lifecycle of their documents from concept to delivery 
to accomplish this  we provide products and services including printed products  pressure sensitive labels  print on demand services  document automation  document design  outsourcing  warehouse and distribution services  and professional services 
we make a measurable difference for our customers by helping them achieve their desired business outcomes by assisting them with reducing costs  transitioning to more efficient processes  effectively managing their risks and meeting their regulatory and industry requirements  and driving their business growth 
our operations include five reportable segments document management  label solutions  pod services  document systems  and pathforward 
our business challenges we are engaged in an industry undergoing fundamental changes due to advancements in and proliferation of digital technologies 
these changes  in addition to the current economic conditions  create business challenges for us 
we believe our company is facing the following key challenges declines in demand for traditional custom printed documents excess production capacity and price competition within our industry future pension funding requirements and amortization of actuarial gains and losses current economic conditions and disruption in credit markets 
the following is a discussion of these business challenges and our strategy for managing their effect upon our business 
declines in demand for traditional custom printed documents traditional business documents are essential for the conduct of business  but many are being replaced or devalued by software 
however  digital technology also introduces new opportunities with significant growth potential for us  such as print on demand services 
our company s history is one of adapting to change  and our goal is to persevere and grow in the digital age 
we plan to continue to invest in new and existing technologies and services that provide innovative  valuable solutions for our customers document needs 
we believe our extensive expertise within our markets combined with increased focus on targeted solutions for those markets will differentiate us from our competitors and produce growth opportunities outside of traditional printed documents 
excess production capacity and price competition within our industry paper mill operating rates for uncoated freesheet have declined somewhat but still remained high at the end of faced with higher energy and transportation costs  paper mills are expected to continue to manage production capacity through downtime and closures in an attempt to maintain or increase paper prices 
despite a competitive marketplace  we have generally been able to pass through increased paper cost  although it often takes several quarters due to the custom nature of our products and our contractual relationships with many of our customers 
we expect this trend to continue  however  current economic conditions may limit our success at recovering all of our increased costs  resulting in lower margins on products we sell 
to remain competitive  in  we initiated restructuring actions to reduce our annual operating costs by million 
we eliminated approximately positions  primarily in management and overhead  representing million annually in compensation and related costs 
we also consolidated our manufacturing and warehousing operations to save approximately million annually 
other initiatives that targeted purchasing costs and other non compensation expenditures lowered costs by approximately million annually 
future pension funding and loss amortization during   and most recently in  our qualified pension plan became underfunded due to weak stock market returns 
the amortization of these asset losses plus other actuarial losses has resulted in significant pension loss amortization in recent years equivalent to per share in  per share in  and per share in pension loss amortization is expected to be million in  equivalent to per share 
as a result of the losses and possible future losses from a continued weak economy in  we expect pension loss amortization to trend higher in future years 
the pension protection act of became effective in and increases the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plan 
although we do not know the exact amount required for our minimum funding at this time  we estimate our funding will be to million in  which is more than the expected required funding 
based upon the new requirements and the recent decline in the value of our pension assets  it is likely that we will be required to increase our level of contributions in and beyond 
in response to these challenges  we modified our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for employees still accruing benefits under the plans 
effective june   these participants ceased accruing pension benefits and the final pension amounts were based upon pay and service through june  the company match in the k savings plan was increased for the affected employees from to on the first six percent of eligible compensation deferred 
excluding pension loss amortization  we expect to realize annualized savings of approximately million in service costs as a result of these changes 
current economic conditions and disruption in credit markets recent market and economic conditions have been volatile and challenging resulting in decreased demand and significant price competition in an already price competitive environment 
these factors had a significant impact upon our revenues during the year 
although we cannot predict the duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions going forward  we expect to continue to see similar challenges in as a result  we implemented the following actions during to enable the company to maintain a strong financial condition during this economic downturn and achieve its long term objectives we initiated plans to integrate several of our pod services print centers and document management distribution warehouses in order to improve efficiency and reduce cost 
we closed two print centers and one distribution center and integrated two other print centers with warehouses 
we expect to realize approximately million in annualized cost savings as a result of these actions 
we also implemented a plan to redesign our sales support infrastructure to more of a centralized model by the end of march customer transactional and administrative functions are being transitioned from our field sales offices to one of three client support centers  one of which is new 
this action is expected to result in approximately million in annualized cost savings 
in november  we reduced our workforce by  eliminating approximately positions throughout the company 
annualized savings are expected to total approximately million 
late in the year  we renegotiated various contracts to enable us to lower raw material costs  outbound freight charges  and professional service fees 
in addition  we re evaluated production schedules at our manufacturing facilities to substantially reduce over time expenses 
we expect to realize approximately million in annualized savings as a result of these changes 
our focus our sales focus during and in previous years was primarily product driven 
given our substantial experience and expertise within our vertical markets  we are shifting our focus from products to our vertical markets and the challenges and solutions needed in these particular markets 
additionally  we are creating operational efficiencies to reduce costs  improve customer satisfaction  and generate positive cash flow 
in  we will be focusing on increased coverage and improved client satisfaction within our vertical markets relentless pursuit of cost reduction generating positive cash flow 
increased coverage and improved client satisfaction within our vertical markets we believe focusing our efforts on markets where we are trusted industry leaders and have an extensive understanding of the document related issues will enable us to provide valuable solutions specific to these markets in a very timely and highly responsive manner 
one of our main objectives is to expand our sales in these vertical markets by focusing our in depth knowledge on providing a full range of innovative  valuable document and print related solutions for these customers 
key to this objective is offering products and services that are driven by anticipated needs and solutions specific to these customers 
we are also investing in alternative sales channels that will further strengthen our position as a leader in these markets and are aligning our sales infrastructure to enable a higher level of customer service and increased opportunities to present our comprehensive solutions to new and existing customers 
we intend to continue to bring our customers products and services that improve their ability to capture  manage  and move information in their business processes 
we offer a portfolio of standard register managed services that help our customers reduce costs and improve their business processes  allowing them to concentrate on their core competencies 
we expect that our ability to provide for digital print on demand output  including color and variable print  and services that provide the customer with added convenience  design capability  and control over the process to be a strong differentiator among our competitors 
relentless pursuit of cost reduction generating positive cash flow we will continue to critically evaluate costs and improve productivity in order to stay cost competitive and most importantly  generate positive cash flow 
we expect these measures to allow us to weather the current downturn in the economy and position us for growth as the economy strengthens 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we applied the accounting policies disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based on information presently available  and actual results may differ significantly from those estimates 
we consider the estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions is material to our financial condition or results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates are discussed throughout this discussion and analysis where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results 
the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions discussed below for the pension plan  deferred taxes  and inventories generally do not affect segment results 
however  changes in revenue recognition  fair value measurements  and share based compensation expense through an allocation of corporate expenses could impact individual segment results 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pension benefit plan assumptions included in our financial statements are significant pension obligations and benefit costs which are measured using actuarial valuations 
the use of actuarial models requires us to make certain assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
such assumptions include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in addition  the actuarial calculation includes subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension obligations and benefit expense recorded in future periods 
discount rate one of the principal components of calculating the projected benefit obligation and certain components of pension benefit costs is the assumed discount rate 
the discount rate is the assumed rate at which future pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate established at year end for the benefit obligations is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit cost for the following year 
discount rates are established based on prevailing market rates for high quality  fixed income instruments with maturities equal to the future cash flows to pay the benefit obligations when due 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets one of the principal components of the net periodic pension cost calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by our employees 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan s assets are invested in a broadly diversified portfolio consisting primarily of publicly traded common stocks and fixed income securities 
we use long term historical actual return experience and estimates of future long term investment return  with consideration to the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in the net periodic pension cost calculation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the pension cost calculation over five years using a five year  market related asset value method of amortization 
the amortization of these differences has  and will continue to have  a significant effect on net periodic pension cost 
our nonqualified pension benefit plans are unfunded plans and have no plan assets 
therefore  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is not a factor in accounting for these benefit plans 
assumptions regarding mortality one of the assumptions made in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation is an estimate of mortality rates for the population of pension participants 
our actuaries use mortality tables  which include death rates for each age  in estimating the amount of pension benefits that will become payable 
the mortality tables include the proportion of the number of deaths in a specified group to the number living at the beginning of the period in which the deaths occur 
we use the rp mortality table to determine benefit obligations and to determine pension and postretirement benefit cost 
we review the assumptions used to account for our pension obligations and benefit cost each fiscal year end 
weighted average assumptions projected benefit obligation discount rate used for pension obligations holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension obligation recorded by approximately million 
net periodic pension benefit cost discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets holding all other assumptions constant a increase in the discount rate would decrease pension cost by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase pension cost by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase pension benefit cost by million 
amortization of differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets impacts our pension cost 
the actual return on plan assets in was a loss of approximately 
the difference between this loss and the gain expected based upon the long term rate of return created an actuarial loss of approximately million  on an after tax basis  that was charged directly to shareholders equity 
this actuarial loss will be amortized to expense in future years 
changes in discount rates used to value pension liabilities can also impact our pension cost through the amortization of the actuarial gains and losses created 
the change in discount rate from to created an actuarial loss of million  on an after tax basis  which also was charged directly to shareholders equity 
while we previously expected that amortization expense would continue to trend lower in  the significant asset and liability losses in will cause amortization expense to be approximately million in and trend higher in subsequent years 
we currently have approximately million of actuarial losses related to our pension plans that will be amortized to expense in future years 
the long term rate of return on plan assets that we expect to use to determine fiscal net periodic pension cost is  the same as fair value measurements during the second quarter of  we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill 
the test was performed at the reporting unit level using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value of million 
based upon the test results  we determined that the discounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the assets exceeded the carrying value of those assets  therefore  no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
during the second quarter of  we elected to carry forward the test based upon our judgment of the following factors the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit used to determine the fair value had not changed significantly from the valuation resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin based upon an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the valuation  the likelihood that the current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote 
as a result  no impairment of goodwill was recognized in the fair value test performed in our analysis in used significant estimates and assumptions  which included projected future cash flows  discount rates that reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows  growth rates  and determination of appropriate market values 
the most critical estimates used in determining the expected cash flows were the revenue and cost assumptions and the terminal value assumed 
if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  or if either of these two assumptions changed by  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets  including goodwill  for both and deferred taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  and our provision for income taxes  including tax positions taken or to be taken in our tax returns 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans  tax planning strategies  and other expectations about future outcomes 
since the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted  changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
valuation allowances our ability to realize deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the taxable entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
we evaluate all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
we have established valuation allowances for us and canadian capital loss carryforwards of approximately million million in deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that they will not be utilized before the expiration period 
should future taxable income be materially different from our estimates  changes in the valuation allowance could occur that would impact our tax expense in the future 
inventories under the dollar value lifo method  similar items of inventory are aggregated to form inventory pools 
increases and decreases in a pool are identified and measured in terms of the total dollar value of inventory in the pool 
the use of indices is an integral part of the dollar value lifo method 
using the link chain technique  a cumulative index is used to convert deflate year end inventories priced at current cost to base year cost and to convert inflate an increment stated at base year cost back to lifo cost 
under both techniques  indices are developed by pricing all inventory items twice 
in other words  inventory quantities on hand at the end of the current year are priced at current year current costs and at prior year current costs 
this ratio of costs is then used to adjust the cumulative index at the end of the preceding year to a new cumulative index 
the total current cost of current year end in ventories is next converted to total base year cost by means of the new cumulative index 
the net change in inventory is then determined by comparing the total inventory at base year cost at the beginning and the end of the current year 
lifo values are determined  by layer  by applying the applicable cumulative index to the increments stated at base year cost 
we evaluate the lifo calculation each quarter and record an adjustment  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
we determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
we apply internally developed indices that we believe more consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of our inventories and product mix and our merchandise mix 
we believe the internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in our own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics producer price indices or other published indices 
should actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances at the end of any fiscal year differ materially from our interim estimates  changes could occur that would materially affect our consolidated statement of income for that year 
at december   a increase in our cumulative index would have increased our lifo expense approximately million or approximately million after tax 
conversely  a decrease in our cumulative index would have decreased our lifo expense by approximately million or approximately million after tax 
share based compensation expense we currently have  shares of nonvested performance based stock which vests subject to attainment of a pre determined performance goal by the company by fiscal year end the performance goal is a cumulative goal which allows partial vesting if a minimum level of performance is attained over the two year period 
if the minimum level of performance is not attained by the end of  these stock awards will be forfeited and canceled  and all expense recognized to that date will be reversed 
the amount of shares that ultimately vest could range from to of the initial shares granted 
additional shares would be granted and automatically vested upon performance above the target level 
the amount of compensation expense recognized is dependent on the total amount of performance based shares we expect to vest 
this requires us to evaluate the probability of achieving the performance goal and assess the level of goal achievement each quarter 
the amount of compensation expense recorded is subject to adjustment based on changes in our expectations and the actual level of achievement of the performance goal 
we have not recognized any expense in for these awards because  at this time  we do not believe the performance goal will be achieved 
at december   there was million of unamortized expense that may be recognized in if achievement of the performance goal becomes probable 
revenue recognition within our document systems and pathforward segments  we enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as software  professional services  and ongoing maintenance and post contract customer support 
revenue from these segments accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue in we account for the licensing of software in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could change the timing or amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
additionally  while the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are some transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables if there are multiple deliverables  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether the fee is fixed and determinable 
changes in judgments on these interpretations could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides a common definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but is applicable under most current accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the new standard provides guidance on the methods used to measure fair value  including the market  income  and cost approach 
these approaches require us to use certain assumptions in our models that market participants would use in pricing assets and liabilities 
the models may use readily observable  market corroborated  or generally unobservable inputs 
we did not have any financial instruments recorded at fair value that required a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings upon adoption  and there was no material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows as a result of the adoption of sfas we currently do not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value that would require the expanded disclosures under sfas however  fasb staff position fsp r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  issued in december  will require additional disclosures regarding the fair value of pension plan assets in that are similar to those required under sfas we have only partially applied the provisions of the new standard 
as permitted  we have elected to defer application of sfas until for nonfinancial assets and liabilities not currently recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
the major categories of nonfinancial assets and liabilities that would apply to us include goodwill  trademark intangible asset  and property and equipment reported at fair value as a result of impairment testing 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on our consolidated financial statements are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the discussion that follows provides information which we believe is relevant to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition  supplemented by a discussion of segment results where appropriate 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this analysis is presented in the following sections consolidated summary this section provides an overview of our consolidated results from operations for   and segment operating results an analysis of revenue  cost of sales  gross margin  and operating income by segment 
consolidated summary the following summarizes our consolidated results for   and change change revenue cost of sales gross margin gross margin of sales sg a expense restructuring asset impairment other expense  net income loss from continuing operations before taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations we previously disclosed depreciation and amortization expense as a separate line item under operating expenses 
in  we reclassified the applicable amount of expense to cost of sales for those assets related to the production of goods or services 
the remainder of expense is included in selling  general and administrative expense 
all prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
revenue during  the company s revenue was under pressure from several aspects 
adoption of digital technologies continued to erode revenues from traditional print as expected within the industry 
the volatile economic conditions also led to weaker pricing in an already over supplied and competitive industry as our customers were forced to seek further cost savings in their own operations 
additionally  some of our products are used by manufacturing customers in their products 
the declining consumer demand over the year translated to lower unit sales for these products as manufacturing customers reduced their production in response to the downturn in the economy 
as a result of these factors  revenue declined million or from the prior year 
lower unit sales accounted for a decline of approximately while pricing accounted for a slight increase of  primarily reflecting the pass through of increased paper and fuel costs 
we estimate that economic factors accounted for approximately of the revenue decline 
economic conditions have continued to be weak thus far in  and we expect a continuation of this trend through in  consolidated revenue was down million or from the prior year 
three customers accounted for a total decline of million in revenue 
these included the loss of label business at a large pharmacy  price cuts at a major bank  and a reduction in prescription pad sales representing the difference between the initial program rollout in and a much lower maintenance level in these declines were offset primarily by growth in our commercial print business and modest price increases 
cost of sales gross margin cost of sales decreased million or from to lower unit sales accounted for a decline of approximately million 
material prices increased approximately million  however  this increase was offset partially by million of cost savings in production and compensation costs realized as a result of the and restructuring actions discussed previously 
despite a decline in revenue  the gross margin percentage improved slightly to in  compared to in cost of sales in compared to decreased million or  primarily the result of lower unit sales 
this decrease was partly offset by temporarily higher costs incurred in conjunction with the closing of our middlebury facility 
as a result  gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expense selling and sales support research and development general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization of pension net actuarial losses pension settlements other pension and postretirement expenses total selling  general and administrative expense total sg a expense decreased or in pension settlements declined million and pension amortization decline million  accounting for more than half of the decline in sg a expense 
other pension costs decreased million primarily due to decreased pension service costs as a result of the plan modifications 
a more detailed discussion of pension loss amortization and pension settlements is provided below 
selling and sales support decreased million primarily as a result of the and restructuring actions  lower incentive compensation due to reduced revenue  and lower travel related expenses 
depreciation continued to trend down by million  reflecting the asset lighter strategy the company has adopted 
overall  we have maintained our lower cost structure from our restructuring actions with the exception of an increase in healthcare costs during of approximate ly million 
in  sg a expense decreased million as compared to excluding the effect of pension loss amortization and settlements which increased million  sg a expense decreased million 
selling and sales support decreased million primarily due to lower total compensation from the restructuring actions 
general and administrative expenses also declined as a result of the restructuring actions  lower healthcare costs  and lower share based compensation expense 
because performance goals were not met  in we reversed approximately million of general and administrative expense recorded in and related to performance based restricted stock 
we also recorded approximately million of non recurring items  primarily related to sales tax refunds 
depreciation expense declined million as a result of lower capital expenditures in recent years 
pension loss amortization and pension settlements our qualified pension plan became underfunded in primarily as a result of the weak stock market in and and subsequent declines in interest rates 
this produced actuarial losses that are amortized to expense in subsequent years 
non cash pension loss amortization was million  million  and million in   and and is expected to be million in during  the plan s assets experienced significant declines in market value due to the weak economic conditions at the end of these declines  combined with declines in interest rates  resulted in additional accumulated actuarial losses that will be amortized in future years causing pension loss amortization to trend higher in future years 
as a result of associates retiring and electing a lump sum payment of their pension benefit we recorded non cash settlement charges of million and million in net periodic benefit cost for and no settlement charges were incurred in a pension settlement charge is recorded when the total lump sum payments for a year exceed total service and interest costs recognized for that year 
the settlement charge recognizes a pro rata portion of the unrecognized actuarial net losses 
restructuring and other exit costs the company has undertaken cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions as part of ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies  reduce costs  and maintain a strong financial condition 
we recorded million  million  and million of restructuring charges and other exit costs in   and related to these savings initiatives 
we intend to continue to critically evaluate operations and costs and may initiate additional cost reducing initiatives or restructurings in the future 
during  we initiated plans to close two print centers and one distribution center and to integrate two other print centers into our distribution warehouses as part of a plan to improve efficiency and reduce cost 
in connection with these changes  we expect to have involuntary termination costs of approximately million  contract termination costs of million  and other associated exit costs of million 
this should result in annualized cost savings of approximately million in compensation and facility rent that will be reflected in cost of sales 
the last of these actions were completed in early we also began implementing a twelve month plan to redesign our sales support infrastructure to more of a centralized model 
we will transition customer transactional and administrative functions from our field sales offices to one of three client support centers  one of which is new  by the end of march this action should generate approximately million annually in compensation and related cost savings that will be reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect to have involuntary termination costs of million and contract termination costs of million 
lastly  late in  we eliminated approximately positions throughout the company 
this action was in response to decreased revenues  expected declines in some traditional products  and our expectation that the overall economy will remain weak in annualized savings are expected to total approximately million in compensation and related savings  with approximately million to be reflected in cost of sales and million in sg a expense 
involuntary termination costs are expected to be million 
pre tax components of restructuring and other exit costs consist of the following total total expected costs expense involuntary termination costs contract termination costs other associated exit costs total a summary of the accrual activity is as follows charged to incurred balance accrual in involuntary termination costs contract termination costs total in  we implemented plans to reduce our annual operating costs by million 
within the document management segment  we closed our middlebury  vermont production plant as part of a plan to consolidate our manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
the plant s productive capacity was transferred to three other existing plants 
we recorded million of restructuring costs in the document management segment related to the closing of the middlebury plant  million for employer related costs  and million of other associated exit costs  primarily for equipment removal and relocation  employee relocation  and inventory write offs 
in addition  we eliminated approximately positions  primarily in management and overhead  representing million annually in compensation and related costs 
total restructuring costs were million for severance and employer related costs 
at the end of  all actions were completed  and all related expenses were paid in second half costs and expenses were approximately million lower than the first half of these restructuring actions have continued to produce benefits in  contributing to the significant reduction in sg a expense and increasing gross margin percentages despite declining revenue 
and prior within the label solutions segment  we closed our terre haute  indiana label production plant 
the plant s production capacity was transferred to three other existing plants to improve overall efficiency and lower operating costs 
total costs incurred included million for severance and employer related costs and million for other directly associated costs  primarily equipment removal and relocation 
in  we also incurred million of expense from prior restructuring actions for vacated facilities that we were unable to sublease and additional involuntary termination costs 
other income expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in  compared with million and million in and the decrease in was primarily the result of much lower interest rates during combined with lower debt balances 
interest expense increased in due to higher debt balances carried during the year 
income taxes the effective tax rates were   and  for   and the reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate follows statutory federal income tax rate state and local income taxes change in cash surrender value charitable contributions expiration capital loss valuation allowance state rate changes permanent and other items effective tax rate changes in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies held in a rabbi trust for our deferred compensation plan are not includable in taxable income and create differences between our statutory and effective tax rates 
in  we experienced a significant decline in value that was not deductible for tax purposes  increasing our effective rate by 
in  cash surrender value increased which reduced our effective rate by 
in  we reduced our deferred tax asset for the value of charitable contributions that will not be realized as a tax deduction due to their expiration  increasing our effective tax rate by 
in addition  in a tax valuation allowance was established in connection with a capital loss that will likely not be offset by future capital gains  which increased our effective rate by 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations almost doubled in from a loss of million in to income of million in  despite the significant decline in revenue

a reconciliation of operating income per segment to consolidated income from operations is provided in note segment reporting of the notes to financial statements 
document management our document management segment operates in a market generally characterized by excess capacity and price competition 
the volatile economic conditions during intensified these conditions and led to an accelerated rate of decline in this segment s traditional print products during in  traditional products declined approximately compared to in additionally in  our commercial print business was down approximately  reflecting a shift in our product mix in favor of higher margin products 
pricing overall was up slightly in in response to higher paper costs 
however  despite the increases  revenue was down approximately in revenue was down in as a result of the decline in traditional products which was offset primarily by growth in our commercial print business and increased prices for paper costs 
the gross margin percentage declined in and this pattern reflected the combination of lower unit sales  competitive pricing  and temporarily higher costs related to plant consolidations in and however  costs of sales improved significantly in the second half of and into as the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring actions were realized 
as a result  the gross margin percentage improved from in to in despite lower revenue in and  operating income was down by only million in and increased million in as a result of lower sg a expenses to allocate to the segments and lower depreciation 
allocated sg a expense was million  million  and million in   and label solutions the label industry also competes on price  but the company attempts to differentiate itself by offering highly value added solutions 
gross margins tend to be higher than for traditional printed products 
label solutions revenue declined million or in and million or in decreased unit sales accounted for approximately and of the decline in and the loss of business with a single pharmacy account that changed the manner in which it labeled its prescription bottles accounted for the decline in units in and approximately of the decline in units in this segment primarily serves the industrial sector and was also particularly affected by the economy during as many manufacturing customers scaled back their production due to weak consumer demand 
these factors contributed to the remaining decline in units for unit declines were offset by modest price increases in and as a result of our efforts to recover higher material costs 
in  we continue to see our manufacturing customers reduce production which could have an impact on sal es volume 
cost of sales decreased million or approximately in manufacturing costs were lower as a result of the recent restructuring actions  while the loss in unit sales reduced costs by approximately 
these reductions were offset by increased material costs and increased start up costs related to the inmold label product of approximately 
cost of sales decreased million or in due to reduced costs realized as part of our restructuring actions and decreased costs as a result of lower unit sales  which were partly offset by increased start up costs at our mexico label plant 
despite revenue declines  the gross margin percentage has been stable or improving in each year reflecting the benefits of our cost saving initiatives and plant consolidations in previous years 
operating income was down million in and million in  reflecting the decline in revenue  offset by the reduced level of sg a expenses for allocation 
sg a expense allocated this segment was million  million  and million in   and pod services our pod services segment provides short run offset and digitally printed products plus a variety of related services 
short run offset products have declined between and for each of the three years 
these declines were in line with expectations based upon continuing trends in consumer preferences for digital print 
offset products represented about of this segment in  versus in digital print increased approximately and in and  but was down almost in expected growth in digital print revenue was not realized primarily as a result of poor economic conditions during  particularly within the financial services industry 
overall  revenue was down million in and million in primarily due to decreases in unit sales 
average selling prices were slightly higher in both years  reflecting the pass through of higher paper costs 
in  cost of sales decreased approximately  reflecting declines in unit sales of and lower costs due to restructuring actions of  offset by increased material costs of approximately 
in  cost of sales decreased approximately due to lower unit sales and cost reductions realized from our restructuring actions 
these cost reductions were offset slightly by increased material costs 
this segment s gross margin percentage has also remained stable or increased each year despite revenue declines due to savings realized from our restructurings and cost reduction activities 
operating income decreased million in as a result of lower gross margin of million offset by a million lower sg a allocation 
in  the operating profit increased million despite the lower gross margin  also reflecting a reduced level of sg a expense allocation 
the amount of sg a expense allocated was million  million  and million in   and document systems document systems sells application software and services that facilitate the secure  on demand printing of business documents 
document systems also generates revenue from the sale of related hardware equipment such as printers 
total revenue increased in but declined in as a result of the weak economy  particularly in the fourth quarter of sales for hardware  services  and most software products were down from lower selling prices and lower unit sales  offset by a small improvement in some growth targeted software products 
gross margin percentages were consistent in and in  the gross margin percentage decreased from to as a result of changes in product mix primarily related to a reduced level of professional service sales 
the reduction in gross margin and increased sg a expenses resulted in the million decline in operating income in this segment received a higher sg a allocation this year due to the allocation being based upon much higher budgeted revenue compared to actual revenue 
allocated sg a expense was million  million  and million in   and pathforward pathforward provides consulting and commercial print management services 
this segment also markets software that enables a company to manage the cost and utilization of its fleet of desktop printers  copiers  and fax machines 
revenue was down million in due to decreased unit sales 
in  revenue increased by million due to growth in commercial print outsourcing and increased unit sales 
this segment has reported operating losses in each year 
the gross margin improved in to on higher unit sales  but start up costs related to new products were also high  producing the loss of million 
lower revenue combined with increased fixed costs associated with the development and purchase of newer software products further declined gross margin in as a result of the decreased gross margin of million  in addition to increased sg a expense allocated to the segment and higher variable costs associated with the introduction of new software  operating income declined million in sg a expense allocated to this segment was million in and and million in liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources will include an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which include both continuing and discontinued operations  plus a summary of our significant contractual obligations 
this discussion also presents financial measures that are considered non gaap 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows where amounts are either excluded or included not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in particular  we will segregate and highlight cash flows related to restructuring and contributions to our qualified pension plan  both of which are carefully monitored by management and have a significant and variable impact on cash flow 
in addition  because our outstanding debt is borrowed under a revolving credit agreement which currently permits us to borrow and repay at will up to a balance of million subject to limitations related to receivable balances and letters of credit  we measure cash flow performance prior to debt borrowing or repayment 
in effect  we evaluate cash flow as the change in net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents 
cash flows the major elements of the statements of cash flows are summarized in the following table  followed by an analysis of the items affecting these elements cash inflow outflow net income plus non cash items working capital restructuring payments contributions to qualified pension plan deferred compensation payments and other net cash provided by operating activities acquisitions capital expenditures proceeds from sale of plant  equipment  and discontinued operations net cash used for investing activities debt borrowings payments dividends paid other net cash used for financing activities net change in cash memo add back debt paid borrowed cash flow before change in debt net debt decreased during from million at the outset of the year to an ending balance of million  reflecting a net cash inflow of million 
this compares to cash outflows of million and million in and operating activities cash provided by operations rose significantly in driven by lower working capital  reduced restructuring spending  and lower deferred compensation payments 
in  cash flows increased million  primarily through improved working capital and lower pension contributions 
contributions to the company s qualified pension plan were million in and  versus million in the pension protection act of ppa became effective in and requires an increased level in the minimum funding requirements for our qualified pension plan 
the turmoil in the credit markets during has contributed to a significant decline in the stock markets 
this has had a negative impact on the asset values of the company s plan assets  and based upon the new funding requirements  it is likely that we will be required to increase our level of contributions in and beyond 
current estimates call for a modest step up in funding in subsequent years  assuming no significant actuarial gains or losses going forward 
final regulations under the ppa regarding the calculations of our minimum funding requirement have not been released  therefore the required mandatory pension funding requireme nt for is not known at this time 
based upon preliminary estimates  we expect to contribute approximately to million  which is more than the expected required funding 
deferred compensation balances paid to associates and payments of supplementary pension benefits were significantly higher in  however  they were offset in part by million in cash received from the deferred compensation trust 
investing activities capital spending was in the million range in and during  we limited our capital spending primarily to projects with higher returns on invested capital and those required to maintain operations  lowering our capital expenditures to million 
we expect capital expenditures to be between and million in in  proceeds from the sale of our middlebury facility contributed to million of cash provided from the sale of assets 
the sale of our digital solutions business provided million of cash in  and the sale of insystems provided million of cash in financing activities improved working capital management  cost savings  and relatively low capital expenditures  provided available cash to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million during dividend payments were consistent in each year 
at its february meeting  our board of directors stated its intention to reduce the quarterly dividend from per share to per share in the second quarter  and will consider subsequent dividend payments on a quarter by quarter basis in accordance with its normal practice 
this decision was made after giving consideration to the current economic environment and the company s strategy  equity position  and near term capital needs 
the company s core strategy is to provide document management services to vertical markets where it can maintain a leadership position by virtue of its industry expertise  tailored solutions  and high levels of service 
our primary markets are healthcare  industrial products manufacturing  and selected sectors within the broader commercial marketplace 
our markets are undergoing technological change  however  and we must continue to invest in the people  products  and technologies necessary for us to continue to be the partner of choice to our customers 
our shareholders equity ended the year at approximately million 
this decrease was primarily the result of the actuarial pension losses previously discussed 
further reductions in the level of shareholders equity could limit our ability to declare dividends in the future 
under ohio law  a company cannot declare a dividend in excess of its surplus the difference between total shareholders equity and the par value of outstanding shares 
the company s surplus was million at year end 
cash flow has been more than adequate to fund the dividend over the last five years  as evidenced by the million decrease in our net debt over that period 
during this extraordinary time  however  it is our board s opinion that capital preservation and prudent investments in pursuit of our strategy best serves the company s long term interests 
capital structure our capital structure appears in the table below capital structure total debt less cash and short term investments net debt equity total net debt total capital the company currently has a million senior secured revolving credit agreement credit facility with seven banks that permits borrowing and repayment as needed throughout the year 
the credit facility  which expires in may  is secured by accounts receivable  inventories  and certain other assets 
borrowings are limited to of eligible receivable balances less letters of credit 
at year end  outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million and available unborrowed credit was million 
there is a fixed charge coverage covenant test that becomes applicable if the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances falls below million 
despite the turmoil in the current credit markets  we have not experienced any restrictions or constraints on our ability to utilize the facility per our agreement 
we believe our credit agreements reside with sound financial institutions  therefore  we do not anticipate any such restrictions in the near future 
interest on the revolver is at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable spread based on the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate 
at the end of january  the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  had dropped to versus at december  in addition  the company pays a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility  currently the fee is basis points 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  available cash reserves  and our existing credit facility are sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditures  dividends  and investments in growth initiatives over the next year 
in our judgment  our strong balance sheet could support additional debt financing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  some of the amounts we included in this table are based on estimates and assumptions about our obligations  and the amounts we actually pay in the future may vary from the amounts reflected below 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt loan payable operating leases purchase commitments pension plans postretirement benefit obligation total the debt payment information represents amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit 
no interest on amounts due is included due to the varying levels at which we utilize our line of credit 
the loan payable represents a financing arrangement for software and includes interest 
we are obligated under operating leases for real estate  sales offices  transportation and other equipment 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the obligations under these operating leases are not recorded on our balance sheet 
we have no purchase agreements with suppliers extending beyond normal quantity requirements 
we have the following commitments at december purchase commitments for capital improvements aggregating million multiple years remaining on commitments with software companies for total annual license maintenance fees of million 
we outsource certain information technology and telecommunication services from suppliers under agreements that expire during at december   the early termination penalties total approximately million 
the pension plan obligations included in the table above represent benefit payments for to under the nonqualified defined benefit plans that are unfunded 
the amounts also include estimated contributions of million per year through year for our qualified plan  which are based upon the amount currently estimated for we do not know the required minimum funding at this time for and future years  however  we anticipate the required funding could be higher than our estimated contributions 
we have not included any estimated contributions after year as we cannot estimate the amounts at this time 
the postretirement benefit obligation included in the table above represents healthcare benefit payments expected to be paid for future claims under the plan for to we have not included our fin liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits in the contractual obligation table because we cannot estimate the period of future cash payment  if any  for this liability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on our borrowings under our credit facility 
at december   we had million borrowed against the credit facility 
payment of interest on libor contracts is at an annual rate equal to the libor rate plus an applicable margin based on the sum of available unborrowed credit plus certain cash balances 
payment of interest on base rate loans is based on the prime rate 
the weighted average interest rate  including the spread  was at december  a hypothetical basis point movement in the prevailing interest rates on the million of borrowings under the credit facility would result in a million annualized effect on our interest expense 
commodity prices paper is the principal raw material in the production of business forms 
because we have historically been successful in adjusting our sales prices in response to changes in paper costs  we do not believe a change in paper costs would have a material effect on our financial statements  however  an increase of in paper costs  if not recovered by us  would increase cost of sales by approximately million
