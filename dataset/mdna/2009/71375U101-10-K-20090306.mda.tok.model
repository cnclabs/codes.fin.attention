services revenues services revenues are derived from professional services performed developing  implementing  integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure  and software applications 
most of our projects are performed on a time and materials basis  and a smaller amount of revenues is derived from projects performed on a fixed fee basis 
fixed fee engagements represented approximately of our services revenues for the twelve months ended december  for time and material projects  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours our professionals expend in the performance of the project by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using the proportionate performance method 
revenues on uncompleted projects are recognized on a contract by contract basis in the period in which the portion of the fixed fee is complete 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
on most projects  we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel  and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
software and hardware revenues software and hardware revenues are derived from sales of third party software and hardware 
revenues from sales of third party software and hardware are generally recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction 
in the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the transaction and act as an agent  the revenues are recorded on a net basis 
software and hardware revenues are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on our customers demand for these products 
if we enter into contracts for the sale of services and software or hardware  company management evaluates whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and whether the company has objective fair value evidence for each deliverable in the transaction 
if management concludes the services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and can determine objective fair value evidence for each deliverable of the transaction  then we account for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of our multiple element arrangements meet these separation criteria 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of cash and non cash compensation and benefits  including bonuses and non cash compensation related to equity awards  associated with our technology professionals 
cost of revenues also includes the costs associated with subcontractors 
third party software and hardware costs  reimbursable expenses and other unreimbursed project related expenses are also included in cost of revenues 
project related expenses will fluctuate generally depending on outside factors including the cost and frequency of travel and the location of our customers 
cost of revenues does not include depreciation of assets used in the production of revenues which are primarily personal computers  servers and other information technology related equipment 
gross margins our gross margins for services are affected by the utilization rates of our professionals  defined as the percentage of our professionals time billed to customers divided by the total available hours in the respective period  the salaries we pay our consulting professionals and the average billing rate we receive from our customers 
if a project ends earlier than scheduled or we retain professionals in advance of receiving project assignments  or if demand for our services declines  our utilization rate will decline and adversely affect our gross margins 
gross margin percentages of third party software and hardware sales are typically lower than gross margin percentages for services  and the mix of services and software and hardware for a particular period can significantly impact our total combined gross margin percentage for such period 
in addition  gross margin for software and hardware sales can fluctuate due to pricing and other competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist of salaries  benefits  bonuses  non cash compensation  office costs  recruiting  professional fees  sales and marketing activities  training  and other miscellaneous expenses 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expenses related to restricted stock  option grants to employees and non employee directors  and retirement savings plan contributions 
we work to minimize selling costs by focusing on repeat business with existing customers and by accessing sales leads generated by our software vendors  most notably ibm  whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients 
these relationships enable us to reduce our selling costs and sales cycle times and increase win rates through leveraging our partners marketing efforts and endorsements 
plans for growth and acquisitions our goal is to continue to build one of the leading independent information technology consulting firms in north america by expanding our relationships with existing and new clients  leveraging our operations to expand and continuing to make disciplined acquisitions 
as demand for our services grows  we anticipate increasing the number of professionals in our north american offices and adding new offices throughout the united states  both organically and through acquisitions 
we also intend to continue to leverage our existing offshore capabilities to support our growth and provide our clients flexible options for project delivery 
in addition  we believe our track record for identifying acquisitions and our ability to integrate acquired businesses help us complete acquisitions efficiently and productively  while continuing to offer quality services to our clients  including new clients resulting from the acquisitions 
consistent with our strategy of growth through disciplined acquisitions  we consummated nine acquisitions since january   including four in given the current economic conditions  the company has temporarily suspended making additional acquisitions pending improved visibility into the health of the economy

additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to expand our services  respond to competition  pursue acquisition opportunities or continue our operations 
we believe that the current available funds  access to capital from our credit facility  and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and other capital needs for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  purchase accounting  accounting for stock based compensation  and income taxes 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenues are primarily derived from professional services provided on a time and materials basis 
for time and material contracts  revenues are recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours expended in the performance of the contract by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using the input method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
on many projects the company is also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
revenues from software and hardware sales are generally recorded on a gross basis based on the company s role as principal in the transaction 
on rare occasions  the company enters into a transaction where it is not the principal 
in these cases  revenue is recorded on a net basis 
revenues are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  delivery and acceptance have occurred  and collectibility is deemed probable 
the company s policy for revenue recognition in instances where multiple deliverables are sold contemporaneously to the same counterparty is in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
specifically  if the company enters into contracts for the sale of services and software or hardware  then the company evaluates whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and whether it has objective fair value evidence for each deliverable in the transaction 
if the company has concluded that the services to be provided are not essential to the functionality of the software or hardware and it can determine objective fair value evidence for each deliverable of the transaction  then it accounts for each deliverable in the transaction separately  based on the relevant revenue recognition policies 
generally  all deliverables of the company s multiple element arrangements meet these criteria 
the company may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and are required to assess whether one or more units of accounting are present 
fees are typically accounted for as one unit of accounting as fair value evidence for individual tasks or milestones is not available 
the company follows the guidelines discussed above in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenues recognized in any accounting period 
if estimates are revised  material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenues recognized for a given period 
revenues are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities 
sales taxes are generally collected and subsequently remitted on all software and hardware sales and certain services transactions as appropriate 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
each accounting period  we evaluate accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments  historical experience and other currently available information 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue or bad debts as appropriate in the period the risk is identified 
we use considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future reductions to revenue or bad debt expense 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  or net liabilities assumed  in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas  the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill as of october each year and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
as required by sfas  the impairment test is accomplished using a two step approach 
the first step screens for impairment and  when impairment is indicated  a second step is employed to measure the impairment 
the company also reviews other factors to determine the likelihood of impairment 
the company s fair value was determined by weighting the results of two valuation methods market capitalization based on the average price of the company s common stock  including a control premium  for a reasonable period of time prior to the evaluation date generally to days and a discounted cash flow model 
the fair value calculated using the company s average common stock price including a control premium was weighted while the value calculated by the discounted cash flow model was weighted in the company s determination of its overall fair value 
management believes that while the use of its average common stock price  plus a control premium  may be considered the best evidence of fair value in sfas  the declines in the company s stock price  and in the market overall  are not consistently aligned with the company s financial results or outlook 
the discounted cash flow approach allows the company to calculate its fair value based on operating performance and meaningful financial metrics 
a key assumption used in the calculation of the company s fair value using its average common stock price was the consideration of a control premium 
the company reviewed industry premium data and determined an appropriate control premium for its analysis based on the low end of any premium received in transactions over the past several years 
significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow model included projections of revenue growth  net income margins  discount rate  and terminal business value 
the forecasts of revenue growth and net income margins are based upon management s long term view of the business and are used by senior management and the board of directors to evaluate operating performance 
the discount rate utilized was estimated using the weighted average cost of capital for the company s industry 
the terminal business value was determined by applying a growth factor to the latest year for which a forecast exists 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  non compete arrangements and internally developed software  which are being amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
estimated useful lives range from three to eight years 
amortization of customer relationships  non compete arrangements and internally developed software are considered operating expenses and are included in amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a lack of recoverability or revised useful life 
the company s annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of october  the company s fair value as of the annual testing date exceeded its book value and consequently  no impairment was indicated 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the continuous trading of its common stock below book value was a possible indicator of impairment to goodwill or long lived assets as defined under sfas and sfas  triggering the necessity of impairment tests as of december  in accordance with sfas  the company tested its long lived assets for impairment prior to performing an interim test of goodwill impairment 
assets were grouped together to test recoverability based on the lowest level of identifiable cash flows directly attributable to those assets 
fair values of the identified asset groups were calculated using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for calculating the fair value of the asset groups were similar in nature to those described above 
based on the valuations performed  the company determined that the cash flows of one of the identified asset groups would not be sufficient to recover the group s carrying amount 
consequently  we recorded an impairment of million primarily related to customer relationship intangible assets acquired from e tech 
the value of these relationships was affected primarily by the loss of a key customer acquired by e tech  which caused cash flows from the acquired relationships to be lower than originally projected 
after recording the impairment of the e tech customer relationships intangible asset  the company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and based on the weighted average of market capitalization  including a control premium  and discounted cash flow analysis  goodwill was not impaired as of december  changes in management intentions  market conditions  our stock value  operating performance  and other similar circumstances could affect the assumptions used in the future for the impairment tests described above 
changes in the assumptions could result in future impairment charges that could be material to our financial results in any given period 
subsequent to december  our stock price has declined 
accordingly  the company will continue to evaluate the carrying value of the remaining goodwill and intangible assets to determine whether the decline in stock price is an indication that there is a triggering event that may require the company to perform an interim impairment test and record impairment charges to earnings  which could adversely affect the company s financial results 
purchase accounting we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
such fair market value assessments require significant judgments and estimates that can change materially as additional information becomes available 
the purchase price is allocated to intangibles based on management s estimate and an independent valuation 
management finalizes the purchase price allocation within twelve months of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting estimates are resolved 
accounting for stock based compensation the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the company s stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
restricted stock awards are valued at the price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
in february  the fasb issued staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  which delayed the effective date of sfas for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities  including fair value measurements under sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas  to fiscal years beginning after november  therefore  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on the following three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
exchange rate sensitivity during the year ended december   million and million of our total revenues were attributable to our canadian operations and revenues generated in europe  respectively 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term intercompany transactions with our canadian  chinese  and indian subsidiaries and from client receivables denominated in other than our functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries incur a significant portion of their expenses in their applicable currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
based on the amount of revenues attributed to clients in canada and europe during the year ended december   this exchange rate risk will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
