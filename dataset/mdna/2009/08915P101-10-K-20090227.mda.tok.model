in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to correct an error in our previously recognized straight line rent expense  substantially all of which related to prior periods and accumulated over a period of years 
this charge reduced net income by million  or per diluted share 
we have determined this charge to be immaterial to our prior periods and current year consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and cash dividends 
we fund our liquidity requirements primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash on hand  future funds from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives for at least the next twelve months 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
we may repurchase shares of our common stock under our authorized share repurchase program  depending on business conditions  the market price of our common stock and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure 
due to the current challenging operating and economic environment  we currently expect to reduce or discontinue share repurchases in fiscal we ended fiscal with million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million in fiscal the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years fiscal year dollars in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents the seasonality of our business historically provides greater cash flow from operations during the holiday and winter selling season  with fourth quarter sales traditionally generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
typically  we use operating cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund inventory increases in anticipation of the holidays and our inventory levels are at their highest in the months leading up to christmas 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 
our cash flow from operations for fiscal increased from fiscal which enabled us to reduce our long term debt levels year over year 
for fiscal we purchased lower quantities of inventory during the year to reduce our overall inventory levels in anticipation of weaker consumer demand resulting from the challenging retail 
table of contents environment 
our cash flow from operations for fiscal was below fiscal which contributed to higher long term debt levels year over year 
for fiscal we purchased larger quantities of inventory earlier in the year to insure adequate product availability for the holiday and winter selling season 
the higher inventory levels and timing of purchases combined with lower than anticipated sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in reduced operating cash flow for the year 
also contributing to the higher debt levels for fiscal were amounts paid to repurchase our stock and higher capital expenditures 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects lower levels of merchandise inventory purchases to better align our inventory balances with weaker sales in the current economic environment  offset by lower net income in fiscal  reductions in accounts payable related to reduced inventory purchases and reduced accrued expenses primarily related to employee compensation and benefits and advertising expense 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures  excluding non cash acquisitions  represented substantially all of the net cash used in investing activities for each period 
capital spending primarily reflects new store openings  store related remodeling  distribution center and corporate headquarters costs and computer hardware and software purchases 
capital expenditures by category as a percentage of total capital expenditures for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows fiscal year new stores store related remodels distribution center computer hardware  software and other total our capital expenditures are primarily for opening new stores and for store related remodels  including new stores  net of closures and relocations  in fiscal  new stores  net of closures and relocations  in fiscal  and new stores in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal included amounts related to the implementation of computer system improvements and enhanced security measures to support our infrastructure

for fiscal  cash was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility  prepay our outstanding term loan and pay dividends 
as of december   we had revolving credit borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our financing agreement 
these balances compare to borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our financing agreement as of december  our revolving credit facility balances have historically increased from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter and from the end of the third quarter to the week of thanksgiving 
the historical increases in our revolving credit facility balances reflect the build up of inventory in anticipation of our summer and winter selling seasons 
revolving credit facility balances typically fall from the week of thanksgiving to the end of the fourth quarter  reflecting inventory sales during the holiday and winter selling season 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our revolving credit facility balance did not decrease as much as expected due to lower than anticipated sales levels 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our revolving credit facility balance declined in line with our historical trends  
table of contents due in part to lower overall inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid in the first quarter of fiscal beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized an increase of the dividend to an annual rate of per share of outstanding common stock 
quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid in the remainder of fiscal  and due to the nearly unprecedented downturn in the economy  the company s board of directors has reduced the company s quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock  for an annual rate of per share 
this decision is consistent with the company s objective to utilize its capital to maintain a healthy financial condition during these challenging economic times 
the quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  periodically  we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors 
depending on business conditions  we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons  including the current market price of our stock  to offset dilution related to equity based compensation plans and to optimize our capital structure 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under this program  we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  at which time the program was completed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under the authorization  we may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the sec 
however  the timing and amount of such purchases  if any  would be at the discretion of management  and would depend upon market conditions and other considerations 
under this program  we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
due to the current challenging operating and economic environment  we currently expect to reduce or discontinue share repurchases in fiscal financing agreement 
on december   we entered into a million financing agreement with the cit group business credit  inc and a syndicate of other lenders 
on may   we amended the financing agreement to  among other things  increase the line of credit to million 
in and the agreement was further amended to  among other things  adjust various definitions relating to borrowing availability under the agreement and revise certain covenants  including the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement 
the initial termination date of the revolving credit facility is march  subject to annual extensions thereafter 
the revolving credit facility may be terminated by the lenders by giving at least days prior written notice before any anniversary date  commencing with its anniversary date on march  we may terminate the revolving credit facility by giving at least days prior written notice  provided that if we terminate prior to march   we must pay an early termination fee 
unless it is terminated  the revolving credit facility will continue on an annual basis from anniversary date to anniversary date beginning on march  under the revolving credit facility  our maximum eligible borrowing capacity is limited to of the aggregate value of eligible inventory during october  november and december and during the remainder of the year 
an annual fee of  payable monthly  is assessed on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
as of december  and december   our total remaining borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility  after subtracting letters of credit  was million and million  respectively 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at various rates based on our overall borrowings  with a floor of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate and a ceiling of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate 

table of contents the following table provides information about borrowings under our financing agreement as of and for the periods indicated fiscal year dollars in thousands fiscal year end balance average interest rate maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year our financing agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
our financing agreement contains various financial and other covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to in certain circumstances  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or to create various liens and restrict the amount of capital expenditures that we may incur 
our financing agreement also restricts our ability to engage in mergers or acquisitions  sell assets  repurchase our stock or pay dividends 
we may repurchase our stock or declare a dividend only if no default or event of default exists on the stock repurchase date or dividend declaration date  as applicable  and a default is not expected to result from the repurchase of stock or payment of the dividend and certain other criteria are met  as more fully described in part ii  item  market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  of this annual report on form k 
the requirements are described in more detail in the financing agreement and the amendments thereto  which have been filed as exhibits to our previous filings with the sec 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our financing agreement as of december   and we expect to be in compliance at the end of the first quarter of fiscal if we fail to make any required payment under our financing agreement or if we otherwise default under this instrument  the lenders may i require us to agree to less favorable interest rates and other terms under the agreement in exchange for a waiver of any such default or ii accelerate our debt under this agreement 
this acceleration could also result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at that time 
future capital requirements 
we had cash on hand of million at december  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding non cash acquisitions  to range from approximately million to million  primarily to fund the opening of new stores  store related remodeling  distribution center equipment and computer hardware and software purchases 
as of february   a total of million remained available for share repurchases under our share repurchase program 
we consider several factors in determining when and if we make share repurchases including  among other things  our alternative cash requirements  existing business conditions and the market price of our stock 
due to the current challenging operating and economic environment  we currently expect to reduce or discontinue share repurchases in fiscal and to substantially slow our store expansion efforts in fiscal in comparison to previous years 
additionally  due to the unprecedented downturn in the economy  the company s board of directors has reduced the company s quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock  for an annual rate of per share 
this decision is consistent with the company s objective to utilize its capital to maintain a healthy financial condition during these challenging economic times 
the quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  we believe we will be able to fund our cash requirements  for at least the next twelve months  from cash on hand  operating cash flows and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
however  our ability to satisfy our cash requirements depends upon our future performance  which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks  and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  including factors beyond our control 
see item a  risk factors  included in this annual report on form k 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital  which would likely result in increased interest expense 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations  discontinue repurchasing our stock  suspend dividend payments or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
we might not be able to effect successful alternative strategies on satisfactory terms  if at all
