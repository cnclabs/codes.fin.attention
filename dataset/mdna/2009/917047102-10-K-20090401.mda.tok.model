table of contents item a 
risk factors our business segments are sensitive to economic conditions  consumer spending  shifts in fashion and industry and demographic conditions 
we are subject to seasonal variations and face numerous business risk factors 
consumer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products  including our products  may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there is a risk that consumer sentiment may decline due to economic and or geo political factors  which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending  which have continued to deteriorate and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future 
some of the factors impacting discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions  wages and employment  consumer debt  reductions in net worth based on recent severe market declines  residential real estate and mortgage markets  taxation  fuel and energy prices  interest rates  consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected 
the downturn in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our merchandise and adversely impact our results of operations and continued growth 
the economic conditions may also affect the number of specialty retail businesses and their ability to purchase merchandise from our wholesale segment 
it is difficult to predict how long the current economic  capital and credit market conditions will continue and what impact they will have on our business 
we rely heavily on our ability to identify changes in fashion 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and can change rapidly 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
our inability to effectively determine these changes may lead to higher seasonal inventory levels and a future need to increase markdowns to liquidate our inventory 
compared to our retail segment  our wholesale segment is more sensitive to changes in fashion trends because of longer lead times in the manufacture and sale of its apparel 
our fashion decisions constitute a material risk and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in expanding our business and opening new retail stores 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to open and operate new retail stores on a profitable basis 
our operating complexity will increase as our store base grows  and we may face challenges in managing our future growth 
such growth will require that we continue to expand and improve our operating capabilities  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may be unable to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified personnel or successfully manage our growth 
our expansion prospects also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  among other things  competition  the availability of financing for capital expenditures and working capital requirements  the availability of suitable sites for new store locations on acceptable lease terms  and the availability of inventory 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our store 
table of contents expansion goals  nor can there be any assurance that our newly opened stores will achieve revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us  or at all 
if our stores fail to achieve  or are unable to sustain  acceptable revenue and profitability levels  we may incur significant costs associated with closing those stores 
existing and increased competition in the specialty retail  direct to consumer and wholesale apparel businesses may reduce our net revenues  profits and market share 
the specialty retail  direct to consumer and the wholesale apparel businesses are each highly competitive 
our retail stores compete on the basis of  among other things  the location of our stores  the breadth  quality  style  and availability of merchandise  the level of customer service offered and merchandise price 
our anthropologie and free people stores also face competition from small boutiques that offer an individualized shopping experience similar to the one we strive to provide to our target customers 
in addition  some of our suppliers offer products directly to consumers and certain of our competitors 
our free people and leifsdottir wholesale businesses compete with numerous wholesale companies based on the quality  fashion and price of our wholesale product offerings  many of whose products have wider distribution than ours 
many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition as well as financial  marketing and other resources 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
due to difficult economic conditions our competitors may force a markdown or promotional sales environment which could hurt our ability to achieve our historical profit margins 
our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
we believe that we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives  including our chairman  president and co founder  richard a 
hayne  and our chief executive officer  glen t 
senk 
the loss of the services of any of our senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects  as we may not be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
hayne  mr 
senk or any of our other key personnel 
in addition  as our business expands  we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there is a high level of competition for personnel in the retail industry 
our inability to meet our staffing requirements in the future could impair our ability to increase revenue and could otherwise harm our business 
we could be materially and adversely affected if any of our distribution centers are closed 
we operate four distribution facilities worldwide to support our retail and wholesale business segments in the united states  western europe and canada  and for fulfillment of catalog and web site orders 
the merchandise purchased for our united states and canadian retail operation is shipped directly to our distribution centers in lancaster county  pennsylvania and reno  nevada while merchandise purchased for our direct to consumer and wholesale operations is shipped directly to our fulfillment center in trenton  south carolina 
the merchandise purchased for our western europe retail and direct to consumer operations is shipped to essex  england 
if any of our distribution centers 
table of contents were to close for any reason  the other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands 
as a result  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to re open or replace the center 
we rely significantly on foreign sources of production 
we receive a substantial portion of our apparel and other merchandise from foreign sources  both purchased directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions  war and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be adversely affected 
the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured  if the instability affects the production or export of merchandise from those countries 
trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas  or both  applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us 
in addition  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors 
our operating results fluctuate from period to period 
our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income  with a more significant portion of operating income typically realized during the five month period from august to december of each year the back to school and holiday periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during this period  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding this period  could have a more material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels  as we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially before the back to school and holiday selling periods 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory during this period  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of the inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis 
in order to more effectively protect them from infringement and to defend against claims of infringement  the marks are owned by separate subsidiaries who are responsible for maintaining and managing existing and future marks  thereby increasing their value to the company 
we are not aware of any valid claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks and service marks in the united states 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our 
table of contents products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks  service marks and intellectual property of others 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  trademarks and other intellectual property of ours and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and or otherwise adversely impact our business 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism  or if either are threatened  our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores may be negatively impacted 
a substantial portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries  see we rely significantly on foreign sources of production on page if commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores  as well as fulfilling catalog and web site orders 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in introducing additional store concepts 
we may  from time to time  seek to develop and introduce new concepts or brands in addition to our existing urban outfitters  anthropologie  free people and terrain brands 
our ability to succeed in these new concepts could require significant capital expenditures and management attention 
additionally  any new concept is subject to certain risks  including customer acceptance  competition  product differentiation  challenges relating to economies of scale in merchandise sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including management and designers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable  or generate positive cash flow 
if we cannot successfully develop and grow these new concepts  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
we may develop new store concepts through acquisitions and we may not be successful in integrating those acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the possibility that current operating and financial systems and controls may be inadequate to deal with our growth and the potential loss of key employees 
we also may encounter difficulties in integrating any businesses we may acquire with our existing operations 
the success of these transactions depends on our ability to successfully merge corporate cultures and operational and financial systems  realize cost reduction synergies  and as necessary  retain key management members and technical personnel of acquired companies 
in addition  there may be liabilities that we fail  or are unable  to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on any company that we may acquire  or have recently acquired 
also  there may be additional costs relating to acquisitions including  but not limited to  
table of contents possible purchase price adjustments 
any of our rights to indemnification from sellers to us  even if obtained  may not be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired 
any such liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
risks associated with internet sales we sell merchandise over the internet through our websites 
our internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including reliance on third party computer hardware software  rapid technological change  diversion of sales from our stores  liability for online content  violations of state or federal laws  including those relating to online privacy  credit card fraud  risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our websites and their related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunications failures and electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
there is no assurance that our internet operations will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth 
our investments in auction rate securities are subject to risks which may affect the liquidity of these investments and could cause an impairment charge 
approximately of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in a or better rated auction rate securities ars that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations  all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to or greater of par value 
historically  investments in ars have been highly liquid  however  if an auction for the securities we own fails  the investments may not be readily convertible 
liquidity for ars is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually   or days 
the principal associated with failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs  the bond is called by the issuer  a buyer is found from outside the auction process or the debt obligation reaches its maturity 
our ars had a par value of million and a fair value of million as of january  as of january  all of our ars have failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand 
based on review of credit quality  collateralization  final stated maturity  estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity  redemptions of similar ars  previous market activity for same investment security  impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models  we have recorded a million temporary impairment on our ars as of january  to date  we have collected all interest receivable on outstanding ars when due and have not been informed by the issuers that accrued interest payments are currently at risk 
we have the ability to hold the ars investments until their maturity 
we cannot assure that further impairment to our ars will not occur

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two business segments a leading lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment 
our retailing segment consists of our urban outfitters  anthropologie  free people and terrain brands  whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores  catalogs  call centers and web sites 
our wholesale apparel segment consists of our free people wholesale division and leifsdottir  anthropologie s recently launched wholesale division 
free people wholesale designs  develops and markets young women s contemporary casual apparel 
leifsdottir designs  develops and markets sophisticated women s contemporary apparel 
a store is included in comparable store net sales data  as presented in this discussion  if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal  unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year 
sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable 
furthermore  non store sales  such as catalog and website related sales and foreign currency translation adjustments are also considered non comparable 
although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores  we believe that  based only on our observations  changes in transaction volume  as discussed in our results of operations  may correlate to changes in customer traffic 
transaction volume changes may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings  our web advertising  circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base 
our fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  our fiscal ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented

leifsdottir wholesale sales accounted for less than of total consolidated net sales for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales  net of estimated customer returns 
revenue is recognized at the completion of a job or service for landscape sales 
revenue is presented on a net basis and does not include any tax assessed by a governmental authority 
payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash  check  credit card  debit card or gift card 
therefore  our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale and landscape service businesses accounts receivable  which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments 
deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
these custom orders  typically for upholstered furniture  have not been material 
deposits for landscape services are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon completion of service 
landscape services and related deposits have not been material 
we account for a gift card transaction by recording a liability at the time the gift card is issued to the customer in exchange for consideration from the customer 
a liability is established and remains on our books until the card is redeemed by the customer at which time we record the redemption of the card for merchandise as a sale or when we determine the likelihood of redemption is remote 
we determine the probability of the gift cards being redeemed to be remote based on historical redemption patterns 
revenues attributable to gift card liabilities relieved after the likelihood of redemption becomes remote are included in sales and have not been material 
our gift cards do not expire 
sales return reserve we record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported  but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit 
the reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends 
if the actual return rate or experience is materially higher than our estimate  additional sales returns would be recorded in the future 
as of january  and  reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled million and million  representing and of total liabilities  respectively 
marketable securities our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities represent those securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold to 
table of contents maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
interest on these securities  as well as amortization of discounts and premiums  is included in interest income 
available for sale securities represent debt securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity  are not actively traded and are carried at fair value  which approximates amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
when available for sale securities are sold  the cost of the securities is specifically identified and is used to determine the realized gain or loss 
securities classified as current have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date 
securities classified as long term have maturity dates greater than one year from the balance sheet date 
available for sale securities such as ars that fail at auction and do not liquidate under normal course are classified as long term assets  any successful auctions would be classified as current assets 
marketable securities as of january  and were classified as available for sale 
inventories we value our inventories  which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and import related costs  including freight  import taxes and agent commissions 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable value 
criteria utilized by the company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise  the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle  and merchandise currently priced below original cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
the majority of inventory at january  and consisted of finished goods 
unfinished goods and work in process were not material to the overall net inventory value 
net inventories as of january  and january  totaled million and million  representing and of total assets  respectively 
any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventories  cycle counts and recent historical trends 
our physical inventories for fiscal were performed as of june and january our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis 
we expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly  related inventories 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and buildings  and are included in the property and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report 
store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term  including lease renewals which are reasonably assured  or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements 
the typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years 
buildings are recorded at cost 
table of contents and are amortized using the straight line method over years 
furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life  which is typically five years 
net property and equipment as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of our store related assets  we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type eg  mall versus free standing  store location eg  urban area versus college campus or suburb  current marketplace awareness of our brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which  in general  is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
for fiscal  and  write downs of long lived assets were not material 
we have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement  whichever is less 
we did not close any store locations in fiscal as of the date of this report  all of our stores opened in excess of three years are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
deferred tax assets as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk  we establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
we increased valuation allowances to million as of january  from million as of january  this increase occurred based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions 
in the future  if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances  if appropriate 

table of contents accounting for contingencies from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
results of operations as a percentage of net sales the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period 
this table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows fiscal year ended january  net sales cost of sales  including certain buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income other income other expenses income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period change net sales gross profit income from operations net income

the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in comparable store inventory which more than offset additions to inventories for new and non comparable stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal decreased to of net sales versus of net sales for fiscal the rate reduction is primarily due to controlling selling and store support related expenses in addition to lower corporate expenses resulting from non recurring legal fees incurred in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year

income from operations increased to of net sales or million for fiscal compared to of net sales or million for fiscal our annual effective income tax rate increased to of income for fiscal compared to of income for fiscal the increase in this year s tax rate is due to the prior year s annual effective tax rate being favorably impacted by the receipt of one time federal tax incentives for work performed on the development of our new home offices 
see note income taxes in our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for a reconciliation of the statutory us federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as of january  as compared to million as of january  and million as of january  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal occurred primarily as a result of adding million from cash provided by operating activities  which primarily consists of net income 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million of which million was used for construction of new stores and was partially offset by the net activity of marketable securities 
cash from financing activities in fiscal of million was related to exercises of stock options and related tax benefits on stock option exercises 
our working capital for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the changes in working capital primarily relate to changes to the volume of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and inventories relative to inventory related payables and store related accruals 
during the last three years  we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations 
our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories 
we have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts  wholesale businesses and in our european subsidiaries 
cash paid for property and equipment  net of tenant improvement allowances included in deferred rent for fiscal  and were million  million and million respectively  and were primarily used to expand and support our store base 
in fiscal  we substantially completed the construction of our home offices at the navy yard resulting in an additional million of cash paid for property and equipment 
during fiscal  we plan to construct and open approximately new stores  renovate certain existing stores  expand our lancaster county  pennsylvania and reno  nevada distribution centers  decrease our catalog circulation by approximately million catalogs to approximately million catalogs  and purchase inventory for our stores  direct to consumer and wholesale businesses at levels appropriate to maintain our planned sales growth 
we plan to decrease the level of capital expenditures during fiscal to approximately million 
we believe that our new store  catalog and inventory investments have the ability to generate positive cash flow within a year 
improvements to our home office and distribution facilities were necessary to adequately support our growth 
during fiscal  we may enter into one or more acquisitions or transactions related to the expansion of the terrain brand or other new concepts 
we do not anticipate that these acquisitions or transactions individually or in the aggregate will be material 
during fiscal  we plan on substantially completing a  square foot addition to our lancaster  pennsylvania distribution facility 
this facility primarily serves our midwest and east coast stores 
we believe this expansion will support our growth for the next several years 
during fiscal  we entered into an operating lease for a warehouse facility in reno  nevada to support our western united states stores 
the facility is approximately  square feet and the term of the lease is set to expire in with our option to renew for up to an additional years 
during fiscal  we invested approximately million in equipment and other improvements for this location 
in march  we executed a lease for an additional  square feet of warehouse space at our reno  nevada facility 
we believe this expansion will support our growth for the next several years

the program authorizes us to repurchase up to  common shares from time to time  based upon prevailing 
table of contents market conditions 
during the fiscal year ended january   we repurchased and subsequently retired  shares at a cost of approximately million 
no shares were repurchased during fiscal or fiscal on december   we renewed and amended our line of credit facility with wachovia bank  national association the line 
the line is a three year revolving credit facility with an accordion feature allowing an increase in available credit up to million at our discretion  subject to a seven day request period 
as of january   the credit limit under the line was million 
the line contains a sub limit for borrowings by our european subsidiaries that are guaranteed by us 
cash advances bear interest at libor plus to based on our achievement of prescribed adjusted debt ratios 
the line subjects us to various restrictive covenants  including maintenance of certain financial ratios and covenants such as fixed charge coverage and adjusted debt 
the covenants also include limitations on our capital expenditures  ability to repurchase shares and the payment of cash dividends 
as of january   there were no borrowings under the line 
outstanding letters of credit and stand by letters of credit under the line totaled approximately million as of january  the available credit  including the accordion feature under the line was million as of january  we believe the renewed line will satisfy our letter of credit needs through fiscal wachovia bank  national association was acquired by wells fargo  effective january  the wells fargo acquisition does not affect the original line agreement 
we have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations  as well as available credit under our line of credit facility  are expected to fund such obligations and commitments

the company purchases the majority of its merchandise in us dollars  including a portion of the goods for its stores located in canada and europe 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as of january  the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts  
table of contents tax exempt municipal bonds rated a or better  federal government agencies  fdic insured corporate bonds and auction rate securities rated a or better  which bear interest at a variable rate 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  we believe a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable  a change in interest rates earned on the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would normally not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 
approximately of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in a or better rated auction rate securities ars that represent interests in municipal and student loan related collateralized debt obligations  all of which are guaranteed by either government agencies and or insured by private insurance agencies up to or greater of par value 
the company s ars had a par value of million and a fair value of million as of january  as of january   all of the ars held by the company failed to liquidate at auction due to lack of market demand 
as of january   the company had million of par and fair value ars 
liquidity for these ars is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually   or days 
the principal associated with these failed auctions will not be available until either a successful auction occurs  the bond is called by the issuer  a buyer is found from outside the auction process  or the debt obligation reaches its maturity

we have the ability to hold the investments until their maturity 
as a result of the current illiquidity  the company has classified all ars as long term assets under marketable securities 
the company continues to monitor the market for ars and consider the impact  if any  on the fair value of its investments
