statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical fact  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risk factors in part i of this report 
organization main street capital corporation mscc was formed on march  for the purpose of i acquiring of the equity interests of main street mezzanine fund  lp the fund and its general partner  main street mezzanine management  llc the general partner  ii acquiring of the equity interests of main street capital partners  llc the investment manager  iii raising capital in an initial public offering  which was completed in october the ipo  and iv thereafter operating as an internally managed business development company bdc under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
the transactions discussed above were consummated in october and are collectively termed the formation transactions 
immediately following the formation transactions  main street equity interests  inc msei was formed as a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of mscc 
msei has elected for tax purposes to be treated as a taxable entity and is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income 
unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise indicates  the terms we  us  our and main street refer to the fund and the general partner prior to the ipo and to mscc and its subsidiaries  including the fund and the general partner  subsequent to the ipo 
overview we are a principal investment firm focused on providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market companies  which we generally define as companies with annual revenues between and million that operate in diverse industries 
we invest primarily in secured debt instruments  equity investments  warrants and other securities of lower middle market companies based in the united states 
our principal investment objective is to maximize our portfolio s total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments  including warrants  convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company 
our investments generally range in size from million to million 
our investments are made through both mscc and the fund 
since the ipo  mscc and the fund have co invested in substantially every investment we have made 
mscc and the fund share the same investment strategies and criteria in the lower middle market  although they are subject to different regulatory regimes 
see business regulation 
an investor s return in mscc will depend  in part  on the fund s investment returns as the fund is a wholly owned subsidiary of mscc 
we seek to fill the current financing gap for lower middle market businesses  which  historically  have had limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources 
given the current credit environment  we believe the limited access to financing for lower middle market companies is even more pronounced 
the underserved nature of the lower middle market creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of lower middle market companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations 
our ability to invest across a company s capital structure  from senior secured loans to equity securities  allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing solutions  or one stop financing 
providing customized  one stop financing solutions has become even more relevant to our portfolio companies in the current credit environment 
we generally seek to partner directly with entrepreneurs  management teams and business owners in making our investments 
main street believes that its core investment strategy has a lower correlation to the broader debt and equity markets 

table of contents due to the uncertainties in the current economic environment and our desire to maintain adequate liquidity  we intend to be very selective in our near term portfolio growth 
however  we anticipate that our net investment income will continue to grow as we deploy our existing lower yield cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding portfolio investments 
during  we paid approximately per share in dividends 
in september  we declared monthly dividends for the fourth quarter of totaling per share representing a increase from the dividends paid in the fourth quarter of in december  we declared monthly dividends for the first quarter of totaling per share representing a increase from the dividends paid in the first quarter of for tax purposes  the monthly dividend paid in january was applied against the taxable income distribution requirements since it was declared and accrued prior to december  excluding the impact for the tax treatment of the january dividend  we estimate that we generated undistributed taxable income or spillover income of approximately million  or per share  during that will be carried forward toward distributions paid in for the calendar year  we estimate that we will pay dividends in the range of to per share representing an increase of to over the total dividends per share paid during calendar year the estimated range for total dividends is based upon projections of taxable income  anticipated portfolio activity  and the million of spillover income which will be utilized to pay dividends during we will continue to pay dividends on a monthly basis during and will continue to provide quarterly updates related to our dividend guidance 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents plus idle funds investments 
during october  we closed a million multi year investment line of credit 
due to our existing and available cash and other resources  we expect to have sufficient cash resources to support our investment and operational activities throughout all of and well into however  this projection will be impacted by  among other things  the pace of new and follow on investments  investment redemptions  the level of cash flow from operations and cash flow from realized gains  and the level of dividends paid in cash 
the recently enacted american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to small business investment company sbic funds  including the fund  our wholly owned subsidiary 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increases the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million  as adjusted annually based upon changes in the consumer price index 
due to the increase in the maximum amount of sbic leverage available  we will now have access to incremental sbic leverage to support our future investment activities 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  we will allocate such increased borrowing capacity between our wholly owned sbic subsidiary and main street capital ii  lp msc ii  an independently owned sbic that is managed by main street and therefore deemed to be affiliated for sbic regulatory purposes 
it is currently estimated that at least million to million of additional sbic leverage is now accessible by main street for future investment activities  subject to the required capitalization of our wholly owned sbic subsidiary 
in our view  the sbic leverage  including the increased capacity  remains a strategic advantage due to its long term  flexible structure and a very low fixed cost 
the sbic leverage also provides proper matching of duration and cost compared with our portfolio debt investments 
the weighted average duration of our portfolio debt investments is years compared to a weighted average duration of over years for our sbic leverage 
this duration on our sbic leverage does not consider the opportunity to revolve or refinance our existing sbic leverage into new year tranches upon contractual maturity 
approximately of portfolio debt investments bear interest at fixed rates which is also appropriately matched by the long term  low cost fixed rates available through our sbic leverage 
in addition  we believe the embedded value of our sbic leverage would be significant if we had adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas relating to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value 

table of contents critical accounting policies basis of presentation the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
for the years ended december  and  the consolidated financial statements of main street include the accounts of mscc  the fund  msei and the general partner 
the investment manager is accounted for as a portfolio investment 
the formation transactions involved an exchange of equity interests between companies under common control 
in accordance with the guidance on exchanges of equity interests between entities under common control contained in sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  main street s results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  are presented as if the formation transactions had occurred as of january  main street s results of operations for the years ended december  and  cash flows for the years ended december  and and financial positions as of december  and are presented on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the results of main street s operations and its cash flows for the year ended december  have been presented on a combined basis in order to provide comparative information with respect to prior periods 
the effects of all intercompany transactions between main street and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  in the first quarter of  certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to conform with the current financial statement presentation 
under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the audit and accounting guide for investment companies issued by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa guide  we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments  including those in which we have a controlling interest  unless the portfolio company is another investment company 
an exception to this general principle in the aicpa guide occurs if we own a controlled operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us  or to an investment company of ours 
none of the investments made by us qualify for this exception 
therefore  our portfolio investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value  as discussed further in note b to our consolidated financial statements  with any adjustments to fair value recognized as net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation from investments on our statement of operations until the investment is disposed of  resulting in any gain or loss on exit being recognized as a net realized gain loss from investments 
portfolio investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of our portfolio investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
as of december  and december   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value including the investment in the investment manager 
we are required to report our investments at fair value 
we adopted the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value  and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
with the adoption of this statement  we incorporated the income approach to estimate the fair value of our debt investments principally using a yield to maturity model  resulting in the recognition of million in unrealized appreciation from ten debt investments upon adoption 
our business plan calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid securities issued by private companies and or thinly traded public companies 
these investments may be subject to restrictions on resale and will generally have no established trading market 
as a result  we determine in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with sfas and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the act 
we review external events  including private mergers  sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies  and include these events in the valuation process 
our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio 

table of contents for valuation purposes  control investments are composed of equity and debt securities for which we have a controlling interest in the portfolio company or have the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company s board of directors 
market quotations are generally not readily available for our control investments 
as a result  we determine the fair value of these investments using a combination of market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we will typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of these investments 
the enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties  other than through a forced or liquidation sale 
typically  private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  cash flows  net income  revenues  or in limited cases  book value 
there is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value 
for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived 
in estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors  including the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results 
we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the investments 
we will also use the income approach to determine the fair value of these securities  based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the portfolio company or the debt security will likely generate 
the valuation approaches for our control investments estimate the value of the investment if we were to sell  or exit  the investment  assuming the highest and best use of the investment by market participants 
in addition  these valuation approaches consider the value associated with our ability to control the capital structure of the portfolio company  as well as the timing of a potential exit 
for valuation purposes  non control investments are composed of debt and equity securities for which we do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company  or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company s board of directors 
market quotations for our non control investments are not readily available 
for our non control investments  we use the market approach to value our equity investments and the income approach to value our debt instruments 
for non control debt investments  we determine the fair value primarily using a yield approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for the debt security  as set forth in the associated loan agreements  as well as the financial position and credit risk of each of these portfolio investments 
our estimate of the expected repayment date of a debt security is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument  as we generally intend to hold our loans to maturity 
the yield analysis considers changes in leverage levels  credit quality  portfolio company performance and other factors 
we will use the value determined by the yield analysis as the fair value for that security  however  because of our general intent to hold our loans to maturity  the fair value will not exceed the face amount of the debt security 
a change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our debt securities using the yield analysis could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
if there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt security is in workout status  we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of a debt security  including the value attributable to the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process  our estimate of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
in addition  changes in the market environment  portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
we determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income we record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected 
dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution 
in accordance with our valuation policy  we evaluate accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectibility 
when a loan or debt security becomes days or more past due  and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations  we will generally place the loan or debt security on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income 
table of contents on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
if a loan or debt security s status significantly improves regarding ability to service the debt or other obligations  or if a loan or debt security is fully impaired or written off  we will remove it from non accrual status 
fee income we may periodically provide services  including structuring and advisory services  to our portfolio companies 
for services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned  which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes 
fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees  net of direct loan origination costs  and are amortized  based on the effective interest method  as additional interest income over the life of the related debt investment 
payment in kind pik interest while not significant to our total debt investment portfolio  we currently hold several loans in our portfolio that contain pik interest provisions 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain regulated investment company ric tax treatment as discussed below  this non cash source of income will need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we may not have collected the cash 
we will stop accruing pik interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that pik interest is no longer collectible 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation plan using the fair value method  as prescribed by sfas no 
r  share based payment 
accordingly  for restricted stock awards  we measured the grant date fair value based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant and will amortize this fair value to share based compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
income taxes mscc has elected and intends to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and  among other things  intends to make the required distributions to our stockholders as specified therein 
as a ric  we generally will not pay corporate level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income 
any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such taxable income 
mscc s wholly owned subsidiary  msei  is a taxable entity which holds certain of our portfolio investments 
msei is consolidated with main street for us gaap reporting purposes  and the portfolio investments held by msei are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the principal purpose of msei is to permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through entities for tax purposes in order to comply with the source income requirements contained in the ric tax provisions 
msei is not consolidated with main street for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense as a result of msei s ownership of certain portfolio investments 
this income tax expense  if any  is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
msei uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

table of contents portfolio composition portfolio investments principally consist of secured debt  equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held companies 
the debt investments are secured by either a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company  generally bear interest at fixed rates  and generally mature between five and seven years from the original investment 
we also receive nominally priced equity warrants and make direct equity investments  usually in connection with a debt investment in a portfolio company 
the investment manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of mscc 
however  the investment manager is accounted for as a portfolio investment of main street  since it is not an investment company and since it conducts a significant portion of its investment management activities outside of mscc and its subsidiaries 
to allow for more relevant disclosure of our core investment portfolio  our investment in the investment manager has been excluded from the tables and amounts set forth below 
summaries of the composition of our core investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total portfolio investments are shown in the following table cost december  december  first lien debt equity second lien debt equity warrants fair value december  december  first lien debt equity equity warrants second lien debt the following table shows the core investment portfolio composition by geographic region of the united states at cost and fair value as a percentage of total portfolio investments 
the geographic composition is determined by the location of the corporate headquarters of the portfolio company cost december  december  southwest west southeast midwest northeast fair value december  december  southwest west midwest southeast northeast 
table of contents main street s portfolio investments are generally in lower middle market companies conducting business in a variety of industries 
set forth below are tables showing the composition of main street s core investment portfolio by industry at cost and fair value as of december  and cost december  december  industrial equipment precast concrete manufacturing custom wood products agricultural services electronics manufacturing transportation logistics retail restaurant health care products mining and minerals manufacturing health care services professional services metal fabrication equipment rental infrastructure products information services industrial services distribution consumer products fair value december  december  precast concrete manufacturing industrial equipment agricultural services electronics manufacturing retail custom wood products restaurant transportation logistics health care services health care products professional services manufacturing metal fabrication industrial services equipment rental information services infrastructure products distribution mining and minerals 
table of contents our core investment portfolio carries a number of risks including  but not limited to investing in lower middle market companies which have a limited operating history and financial resources  holding investments that are not publicly traded and which may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale  and other risks common to investing in below investment grade debt and equity investments in private  smaller companies 
portfolio asset quality we utilize an internally developed investment rating system for our entire portfolio of investments 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is performing in a manner which significantly exceeds our original expectations and projections 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is performing above our original expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is generally performing in accordance with our original expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is underperforming our original expectations 
investments with such a rating require increased main street monitoring and scrutiny 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is significantly underperforming 
investments with such a rating require heightened levels of main street monitoring and scrutiny and involve the recognition of unrealized depreciation on such investment 
the following table shows the distribution of our investments on our to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and excluding main street s investment in the investment manager december  december  investments at percentage of investments at percentage of investment rating fair value total portfolio fair value total portfolio dollars in thousands totals based upon our investment rating system  the weighted average rating of our portfolio as of december  and was approximately and respectively 
as of december  and  we had one debt investment in each period representing and  respectively  of total portfolio fair value excluding main street s investment in the investment manager which was on non accrual status 
in the event that the united states economy remains in a prolonged period of weakness  it is possible that the financial results of small to mid sized companies  like those in which we invest  could experience deterioration  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
in addition  the end markets for certain of our portfolio companies products and services have experienced  and continue to experience  negative economic trends 
we are seeing somewhat reduced operating results at several portfolio companies due to the general economic difficulties 
we expect the trend of reduced operating results to continue throughout consequently  we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions which could have a negative impact on our future results

main street believes presenting distributable net investment income  distributable net realized income  and related per share measures are useful and appropriate supplemental disclosures for analyzing its financial performance since share based compensation does not require settlement in cash 
however  distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income are non us gaap measures and should not be considered as replacements to net investment income  net realized income  and other earnings measures presented in accordance with us gaap 
instead  distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income should be reviewed only in connection with such us gaap measures in analyzing main street s financial performance 
a reconciliation of net investment income in accordance with us gaap to distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income is presented in the table above 
investment income for the year ended december   total investment income was million  a million  or  increase over the million of total investment income for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a million increase in interest  fee and dividend income from investments and a million increase in interest income from idle funds  which was principally earned on the remaining proceeds from our ipo 
the increase in interest  fee and dividend income was primarily attributable to i higher average levels of outstanding debt investments  which was principally due to the closing of eight new debt investments since december   partially offset by debt repayments received during the same period and certain portfolio investments that were on non accrual status or written off in  ii significantly higher levels of cash dividend income from portfolio equity investments  and iii higher levels of fee income

subsequent to the formation transactions and the ipo  we recognized a cumulative income tax expense of million primarily consisting of non cash deferred taxes related to net unrealized gains from certain portfolio equity investments transferred into msei  our wholly owned taxable subsidiary 
these equity investments had historically been made in portfolio companies which were pass through entities for tax purposes 
the transfer of the equity investments into msei was required in order to comply with the ric source income requirements 
we do not anticipate incurring this level of deferred tax expense in future periods  given the amount recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal represents the cumulative impact of deferred taxes related to net unrealized gains on the equity investments transferred

the investment facility is secured by certain assets of mscc  msei and the investment manager 
the investment facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants  including but not limited to i maintaining a minimum liquidity of not less than of the aggregate principal amount outstanding  ii maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least to  and iii maintaining a minimum tangible net worth 
at december   main street had no borrowings outstanding under the investment facility  and main street was in compliance with all covenants of the investment facility 
due to our existing cash and cash equivalents plus idle funds investments and the additional borrowing capacity under the investment facility  we project that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our investment and operational activities throughout all of calendar year and well into however  this projection will be impacted by  among other things  the pace of new and follow on investments  investment redemptions  the level of cash flow from operations and cash flow from realized gains  and the level of dividends paid in cash 
we anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents plus idle funds investments and a combination of future debt and additional equity capital 
due to the fund s status as a licensed sbic  we have the ability to issue  through the fund  debentures guaranteed by the small business administration the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the regulations applicable to 
table of contents sbics  an sbic can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba generally in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital  which generally equates to the amount of its equity capital 
the stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to sbic funds  including the fund 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increases the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million  as adjusted annually based upon changes in the consumer price index 
due to the increase in the maximum amount of sbic leverage available  we will now have access to incremental sbic leverage to support our future investment activities 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  we will allocate such increased borrowing capacity between the fund  our wholly owned sbic subsidiary  and msc ii  an independently owned sbic that is managed by main street and therefore deemed to be affiliated with the fund for sbic regulatory purposes 
it is currently estimated that at least million to million of additional sbic leverage is now accessible by main street for future investment activities  subject to the required capitalization of the fund 
debentures guaranteed by the sba have fixed interest rates that approximate prevailing year treasury note rates plus a spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre paid at any time 
debentures issued prior to september were subject to pre payment penalties during their first five years 
those pre payment penalties no longer apply to debentures issued after september  on december   we  through the fund  had million of outstanding indebtedness guaranteed by the sba  which carried an average fixed interest rate of approximately 
the first maturity related to the fund s sbic debentures does not occur until on december   we entered into a treasury secured revolving credit agreement the treasury facility among us  wachovia bank  national association  and branch banking and trust company bb t  as administrative agent for the lenders 
under the treasury facility  the lenders agreed to extend revolving loans to us in an amount not to exceed million  however  due to the maturation of our investment portfolio and the additional flexibility provided by the investment facility  we unilaterally reduced the treasury facility from million to million during october the reduction in the size of the treasury facility resulted in a reduction in the amount of unused commitment fees paid by us 
the purpose of the treasury facility is to provide us flexibility in the sizing of portfolio investments and to facilitate the growth of our investment portfolio 
the treasury facility has a two year term and bears interest  at our option  either i at the libor rate or ii at a published prime rate of interest  plus in either case 
the applicable interest rates under the treasury facility would be increased by if usage under the treasury facility is in excess of of the days within a given calendar quarter 
the treasury facility also requires payment of per annum in unused commitment fees based on the average daily unused balances under the facility 
the treasury facility is secured by certain securities accounts maintained by bb t and is also guaranteed by the investment manager 
the treasury facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants  including but not limited to i maintaining a cash collateral coverage ratio of at least to  ii maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least to  and iii maintaining a minimum tangible net worth 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the treasury facility  and main street was in compliance with all covenants of the treasury facility 
we intend to generate additional cash from future offerings of securities  future borrowings  repayments or sales of investments  and cash flow from operations  including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies and  to a lesser extent  from the temporary investments of cash in us government securities and other idle funds investments that mature in one year or less with the exception of diversified bond funds 
our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies  operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
if our common stock trades below our net asset value per share  we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations 
see risk factors risks relating to our business and structure 
table of contents stockholders may incur dilution if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock or issue securities to subscribe to  convert to or purchase shares of our common stock for a discussion of the proposal approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for a period of one year ending on the earlier of june  or the date of our annual meeting of stockholders 
we will need approval of similar proposals by our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share after the earlier of june  and the date of our annual meeting of stockholders 
in order to satisfy the code requirements applicable to a ric  we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income  but we may also elect to periodically spillover certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year 
in addition  as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
in january  we received exemptive relief from the sec that permits us to exclude sba guaranteed debt issued by the fund from our asset coverage ratio  which  in turn  enables us to fund more investments with debt capital 
current market conditions beginning in late  the united states entered a recession 
throughout  the economy continued to deteriorate and many believe that the current recession could continue for an extended period 
during  banks and others in the financial services industry reported significant write downs in the fair value of their assets  which has led to the failure of a number of banks and investment companies  a number of distressed mergers and acquisitions  the government take over of the nation s two largest government sponsored mortgage companies  and the passage of the billion emergency economic stabilization act of in october and the billion stimulus bill 
in addition  the stock market has declined significantly  with both the s p and the nasdaq global select market on which our stock trades  declining by nearly between december  and december  as the recession deepened during  unemployment rose and consumer confidence declined  which led to significant reductions in spending by both consumers and businesses 
although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity  including the recently obtained million investment credit facility and the increase in available leverage through the sbic program as part of the stimulus bill  the current turmoil in the debt markets and uncertainty in the equity capital markets provides no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  or at all 
the deterioration in consumer confidence and a general reduction in spending by both consumers and businesses has had an adverse effect on a number of the industries in which some of our portfolio companies operate 
in the event that the united states economy remains in a protracted period of weakness  the results of some of the lower middle market companies like those in which we invest  will continue to experience deterioration  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in their defaults 
in addition  the end markets for certain of our portfolio companies products and services have experienced  and continue to experience  negative economic trends 
we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic or other conditions which could have a negative impact on our future results 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fasb staff position fsp addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share eps

we are currently analyzing the effect  if any  this statement may have on our consolidated results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued staff position no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp provides an illustrative example of how to determine the fair value of a financial asset in an inactive market 
the fsp does not change the fair value measurement principles set forth in sfas since adopting sfas in january  our practices for determining the fair value of our investment portfolio have been  and continue to be  consistent with the guidance provided in the example in fsp therefore  our adoption of fsp did not affect our practices for determining the fair value of our investment portfolio and does not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented in this report 
however  our portfolio companies have and may continue to experience the impacts of inflation on their operating results  including periodic escalations in their costs for raw materials and required energy consumption 
off balance sheet arrangements we may be a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
at december   we had two outstanding commitments to fund unused revolving loans for up to  contractual obligations as of december   our future fixed commitments for cash payments on contractual obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows and total thereafter dollars in thousands unaudited sbic debentures payable interest due on sbic debentures total mscc is obligated to make payments under a support services agreement with the investment manager 
subsequent to the completion of the formation transactions and the ipo  the investment manager is reimbursed for its excess expenses associated with providing investment management and other services to mscc and its subsidiaries  as well as msc ii 
each quarter  as part of the support services agreement  mscc makes payments to cover all expenses incurred by the investment manager  less the recurring management fees that the investment manager receives from msc ii pursuant to a long term investment advisory services agreement and any other fees received for providing external services 
related party transactions we co invested with msc ii in several existing portfolio investments prior to the ipo  but did not co invest with msc ii subsequent to the ipo and prior to june in june  we received exemptive relief from the sec to allow us to resume co investing with msc ii in accordance with the terms of such exemptive relief 
msc ii is managed by the investment manager  and the investment manager is wholly 
table of contents owned by mscc 
msc ii is an sbic fund with similar investment objectives to main street and which began its investment operations in january the co investments among main street and msc ii had all been made at the same time and on the same terms and conditions 
the co investments were also made in accordance with the investment manager s conflicts policy and in accordance with the applicable sbic conflict of interest regulations 
as discussed further in note d to the accompanying consolidated financials statements  main street paid certain management fees to the investment manager during the year ended december  subsequent to the completion of the formation transactions  the investment manager is a wholly owned portfolio company of main street 
at december  and  the investment manager had a receivable of  and a payable of  respectively  with mscc related to recurring expenses required to support mscc s business 
recent developments the recently enacted stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to sbic funds  including the fund  our wholly owned subsidiary 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increases the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million  as adjusted annually based upon changes in the consumer price index

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments and idle funds investments 
our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates  to the extent of any debt investments that include floating interest rates 
the significant majority of our debt investments are made with fixed interest rates for the term of the investment 
however  as of december   approximately of our debt investment portfolio at cost bore interest at floating rates with of those debt investments subject to contractual minimum rates 
all of our current outstanding indebtedness is subject to fixed interest rates for the year life of such debt 
as of december   we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements 
at december   based on our applicable levels of floating rate debt investments  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our level of interest income from debt investments
