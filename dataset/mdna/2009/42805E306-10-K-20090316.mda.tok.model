item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in items and of this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements  which include statements concerning future revenue sources and concentration  gross profit margins  selling and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  capital resources  additional financings or borrowings and additional losses  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k  particularly in item a 
risk factors  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the forward looking statements set forth in this form k are as of march   and we undertake no duty to update this information 
overview we develop  manufacture  market  sell and support veterinary products 
our business is comprised of two reportable segments  core companion animal health  which represented of product revenue  and other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products which represented of product revenue 
the core companion animal health segment cca includes diagnostic and other instruments and supplies as well as single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines  primarily for canine and feline use 
diagnostic and other instruments and supplies represented approximately of our product revenue 
many products in this area involve placing an instrument with a customer and generating future revenue from consumables  including items such as supplies and service  as that instrument is used 
approximately of our product revenue resulted from the sale of such consumables to an installed base of instruments and approximately of our product revenue was from new hardware sales 
a loss of or disruption in supply of consumables we are selling to an installed base of instruments could substantially harm our business 
all products in this area are supplied by third parties  who typically own the product rights and supply the product to us under marketing and or distribution agreements 
in many cases  we have collaborated with a third party to adapt a human instrument for veterinary use 
major products in this area include our handheld blood analysis instrument  our chemistry instrument and our hematology instrument and their affiliated operating consumables 
revenue from products in these three areas  including revenue from consumables  represented approximately of our product revenue 
single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines and other products represented approximately of our product revenue 
since items in this area are single use by their nature  our aim is to build customer satisfaction and loyalty for each product  generate repeat annual sales from existing customers and expand our customer base in the future 
products in this area are both supplied by third parties and provided by us 
major products in this area include our heartworm diagnostic tests  our heartworm preventive  our allergy test kits  our allergy immunotherapy and our allergy diagnostic tests 
combined revenue from heartworm related products and allergy related products represented approximately of product revenue 
we consider the core companion animal health segment to be our core business and devote most of our management time and other resources to improving the prospects for this segment 
maintaining a continuing  reliable and economic supply of products we currently obtain from third parties is critical to our success in this area 
virtually all of our sales and marketing expenses are in the core companion animal 
table of contents health segment 
the majority of our research and development spending is dedicated to this segment  as well 
all our core companion animal health products predominately are sold to or through veterinarians ultimately 
in many cases  veterinarians will mark up their costs to the end user 
the acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success 
core companion animal health products are sold directly by us as well as through independent third party distributors and other distribution relationships  such as our corporate agreement with spah and the sale of kits to conduct blood testing to third party veterinary diagnostic laboratories 
revenue from direct sales  independent third party distributors and other distribution relationships represented approximately  and of core companion animal health product revenue  respectively 
independent third party distributors may be effective in increasing sales of our products to veterinarians  although we would expect a corresponding lower gross margin as such distributors typically buy products from us at a discount to end user prices 
to be effective when working with an independent third party distributor  the distributor must agree to market and or sell our products and we must provide proper economic incentives to the distributor as well as contend effectively for the distributor s time and focus given other products the distributor may be carrying  potentially including those of our competitors 
we believe that one of our largest competitors  idexx  in effect prohibits its distributors from selling competitive products  including our diagnostic instruments and heartworm diagnostic tests 
we believe the idexx restrictions limit our ability to engage national distributors to sell our full distribution line of products 
we intend to return to and sustain profitability through a combination of revenue growth  gross margin improvement and expense control 
accordingly  we closely monitor product revenue growth trends in our core companion animal health segment 
product revenue in this segment grew in as compared to and has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of since  our first full year as a public company 
the other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products segment ovp includes our  square foot usda and fda licensed production facility in des moines  iowa 
we view this facility as a strategic asset which will allow us to control our cost of goods on any vaccines and pharmaceuticals that we may commercialize in the future 
we are increasingly integrating this facility with our operations elsewhere 
for example  virtually all our us inventory is now stored at this facility and fulfillment logistics are managed there 
cca segment products manufactured at this facility are transferred at cost and are not recorded as revenue for our ovp segment 
we view ovp reported revenue as revenue primarily to cover the overhead costs of the facility and to generate incremental cash flow to fund our core companion animal health segment 
our ovp segment includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production  primarily for cattle but also for other animals such as small mammals 
all ovp products are sold by third parties under third party labels 
we have developed our own line of bovine vaccines that are licensed by the usda 
we have a long term agreement with a distributor  agri laboratories  ltd  agrilabs  for the marketing and sale of certain of these vaccines which are sold primarily under the titanium and masterguard brands which are registered trademarks of agrilabs 
this agreement generates a significant portion of our ovp segment s revenue 
agrilabs has the exclusive right to sell the aforementioned bovine vaccines in the united states  africa and mexico until december our ovp segment also produces vaccines and pharmaceuticals for other third parties 

table of contents additionally  we generate non product revenues from licensing of technology  royalties and sponsored research and development projects for third parties 
we perform these sponsored research and development projects for both companion animal and livestock product purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we have identified those critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial position and results of operations based upon a consideration of those accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessment 
we consider the following to be our critical policies 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue through the sale of products  licensing of technology product rights  royalties and sponsored research and development 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized after both the goods are shipped to the customer and acceptance has been received  if required  with an appropriate provision for estimated returns and allowances 
we do not permit general returns of products sold 
certain of our products have expiration dates 
our policy is to exchange certain outdated  expired product with the same product 
we record an accrual for the estimated cost of replacing the expired product expected to be returned in the future  based on our historical experience  adjusted for any known factors that reasonably could be expected to change historical patterns  such as regulatory actions which allow us to extend the shelf life of our products 
revenue from both direct sales to veterinarians and sales to independent third party distributors are generally recognized when goods are shipped 
our products are shipped complete and ready to use by the customer 
the terms of the customer arrangements generally pass title and risk of ownership to the customer at the time of shipment 
certain customer arrangements provide for acceptance provisions 
revenue for these arrangements is not recognized until the acceptance has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
we reduce our product revenue by the estimated cost of any rebates  allowances or similar programs  which are used as promotional programs 
recording revenue from the sale of products involves the use of estimates and management judgment 
we must make a determination at the time of sale whether the customer has the ability to make payments in accordance with arrangements 
while we do utilize past payment history  and  to the extent available for new customers  public credit information in making our assessment  the determination of whether collectibility is reasonably assured is ultimately a judgment decision that must be made by management 
we must also make estimates regarding our future obligation relating to returns  rebates  allowances and similar other programs 

table of contents license revenue under arrangements to sell or license product rights or technology rights is recognized as obligations under the agreement are satisfied  which generally occurs over a period of time 
generally  licensing revenue is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the related agreements  products  patents or technology 
nonrefundable licensing fees  marketing rights and milestone payments received under contractual arrangements are deferred and recognized over the remaining contractual term using the straight line method 
revenue from licensing technology and product rights is reported in our research  development and other revenue line item 
an example of the former  ie licensing technology  is a patent we own under which we grant a third party exclusive rights to the human healthcare market for the life of the patent in exchange for an upfront payment and royalty payments on sales of any product based on the patent 
the upfront payment will be amortized over the life of the patent and reported along with any affiliated royalty payments in our research  development and other revenue line item 
an example of the latter  ie product rights  is our july agreement to license intervet inc certain rights to patents  trademarks and know how for our flu avert in equine influenza vaccine  the world s first intranasal influenza vaccine for horses 
as we had no further rights to manufacture  market or sell this vaccine without intervet inc s permission under this agreement  we are reporting the amortization of the upfront payment we received in this agreement along with any affiliated royalty payments in our research  development and other revenue line item 
the upfront payment is being amortized over the estimated life of the product 
recording revenue from license arrangements involves the use of estimates 
the primary estimate made by management is determining the useful life of the related agreement  product  patent or technology 
we evaluate all of our licensing arrangements by estimating the useful life of either the product or the technology  the length of the agreement or the legal patent life and defer the revenue for recognition over the appropriate period 
occasionally we enter into arrangements that include multiple elements 
such arrangements may include the licensing of technology and manufacturing of product 
in these situations we must determine whether the various elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate elements 
if the elements cannot be separated  revenue is recognized once revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that our obligations to the customer are fulfilled  as appropriate 
if the elements are determined to be separable  the revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on relative fair value and recognized separately for each element when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accounting for these multiple element arrangements  we must make determinations about whether elements can be accounted for separately and make estimates regarding their relative fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectibility risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii a deterioration in the client s financial condition  evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  the company maintains a general allowance for credit risk in its accounts receivable which is not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectible accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the 
table of contents overall allowance change  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts receivable may be necessary 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
inventories are written down if the estimated net realizable value of an inventory item is less than its recorded value 
we review the carrying cost of our inventories by product each quarter to determine the adequacy of our reserves for obsolescence 
in accounting for inventories we must make estimates regarding the estimated net realizable value of our inventory 
this estimate is based  in part  on our forecasts of future sales and shelf life of product 
capitalized patent costs in the year ended december   we deferred and capitalized certain costs  including payments to third party law firms for patent prosecution to expand the scope of our patents  related to the technology or patents underlying a variety of long term licensing agreements 
we owned a portfolio of patents not then utilized in our product development or manufacture 
several entities paid upfront licensing fees to utilize the technology supported by these patents in their own product development and commercialization efforts 
because we believed that we had an obligation to protect the underlying patents  we deferred the revenue associated with these long term agreements and the direct and incremental costs of prosecuting the patents that supported the agreements 
we use the term patent prosecution in this context in the narrow sense often used by intellectual property professionals to describe activities where we seek to expand the scope of existing patents such as geographically  where we may look to expand patent protection into new countries  or for broader applications  such as for newly contemplated uses or expanded claim breadth coverage of the technology defined by those licensing our technology within existing geographies 
a situation where a third party has violated our intellectual property rights by using our patented technology without permission and we have filed a corresponding lawsuit would not meet this definition of patent prosecution and we would therefore expense the corresponding legal expenses as incurred 
in accordance with sfas no 
 paragraph c  we classified patent prosecution expenditures which were capitalized as cash used for investing activities since  like a capital expenditure to improve a building or add a piece of equipment  the cost is a necessary investment into a productive asset to maintain our future revenue process 
no internal costs were capitalized 
these capitalized costs were amortized over the same period as the licensing revenue related to those patents was recognized 
costs in excess of the amount of remaining related deferred licensing revenue were not capitalized  but expensed as incurred 
we capitalized approximately thousand for the year ended december  and amortized approximately thousand for the same period 
in december  we sold all patents for which we had capitalized patent costs and  accordingly  we have no capitalized patent costs on our balance sheet as of december   and we do not expect to capitalize any patent costs in the future 

table of contents deferred tax assets valuation allowance our deferred tax assets  such as a net operating loss carryforward nol  are reduced by an offsetting valuation allowance based on judgmental assessment of available evidence if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we are able to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize a future benefit from a deferred tax asset  we will reduce the related valuation allowance by an amount equal to the estimated quantity of income taxes we would pay in cash if we were not to utilize the deferred tax asset in the future 
the first time this occurs in a given jurisdiction  it will result in a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet and an income tax benefit of equal magnitude in our statement of operations at the time we make the determination 
in future periods  we will then recognize as income tax expense the estimated quantity of income taxes we would have paid in cash had we not utilized the related deferred tax asset 
the corresponding journal entry will be a reduction of our deferred tax asset 
if there is a change regarding our tax position in the future  we will make a corresponding adjustment to the related valuation allowance

table of contents revenue total revenue  which includes product revenue  research and development and other revenue  decreased to million in compared to million in total revenue for increased to million from million in product revenue decreased to million in compared to million in product revenue increased to million in compared to million in core companion animal health segment product revenue increased to million in compared to million in key factors in the increase were greater sales of our chemistry instrument  which was launched in november  our instrument consumables and our heartworm diagnostic tests  somewhat offset by lower sales of our handheld blood analysis instruments and our heartworm preventive  both internationally and domestically 
product revenue from our core companion animal health segment increased to million compared to million in key factors in the increase were higher sales of our instrument consumables  our hematology instruments  our handheld blood analysis instruments  our iv pumps  international sales of our heartworm preventive  our microalbumin laboratory packs and our allergy diagnostic kits 
other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products segment ovp product revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the largest factor in the decrease was approximately million in revenue the united revenue recognized in upon receipt of a payment for product previously shipped and take or pay minimums for and which previously had not been paid as part of a now settled dispute with united vaccines  inc uv  a former customer 
as uv had ceased operations  we did not generate any corresponding revenue from uv in  nor do we expect to generate any revenue from uv in the future 
this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in sales of bovine vaccines under our contract with agrilabs 
product revenue from ovp increased to million compared to million in key factors in the increase were greater sales of fish vaccines  the united revenue and an increase in sales of bovine vaccines under our contract with agrilabs 
decreases in sales of our bulk bovine biologicals and our equine influenza vaccine somewhat offset increased sales in other areas 
we licensed intervet inc exclusive rights to our equine influenza vaccine in july  and our last shipment of this product prior to intervet inc producing the product themselves occurred in the third quarter of revenue from research and development and other revenue decreased by to million in from million in the primary factor in the decrease was thousand in revenue recognized from a service contract in  with no corresponding revenue recognized in as the service contract was completed in the service contract was related to a worldwide patent portfolio covering a number of major allergens and the genes that encode them the allergopharma portfolio and was with the buyer of the allergopharma portfolio  which we sold in december revenue from research and development and other revenue decreased by to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to revenue from the acceleration of approximately million in previously deferred licensing fees recognized upon completion of the sale of the allergopharma portfolio in december  with no corresponding revenue recognized in we expect total revenue to decline slightly when compared to 
table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of two components cost of products sold and cost of research  development and other revenue  both of which correspond to their respective revenue categories 
cost of revenue totaled million for the twelve months ended december   a increase as compared to million for the corresponding period in gross profit decreased to million for as compared to million in gross margin  ie gross profit divided by total revenue  decreased to for as compared to in cost of revenue totaled million for  an increase as compared to million for gross profit increased to million for as compared to million in gross margin decreased to for as compared to in cost of products sold increased to million in the twelve months ended december  from million in gross profit on product revenue decreased to million for from million in the prior year 
product gross margin  ie gross profit on product revenue divided by product revenue  decreased to in as compared to in the largest factor in the decrease was recognition of the united revenue in for which the affiliated cost of products sold had been recognized in prior periods and for which no corresponding revenue or gross profit was recognized in in addition  product mix and increased reserves taken against inventory we expect to expire prior to sale  primarily related to consumables for our new chemistry instrument and our handheld diagnostic instruments  were factors in the decrease 
cost of products sold increased to million in as compared to million in gross profit on product revenue increased to million for from million in product gross margin decreased to in as compared to in product mix was a key factor in the decrease  including sales of our diagnostic instruments  which represented a larger share of overall sales than in our diagnostic instruments tend to be relatively lower margin sales and certain instruments experienced lower gross margins in than in due to aggressive sales and marketing programs in this was somewhat offset by recognition of the united revenue for which the affiliated cost of products sold had been recognized in prior periods 
cost of research  development and other revenue increased to thousand in the twelve months ended december  as compared to thousand in gross profit on research  development and other revenue decreased to million for from million in other gross margin  ie gross profit on research  development and other revenue divided by research  development and other revenue  decreased to for as compared to in a factor in the decline was lower margins on sponsored research and development revenue 
cost of research  development and other revenue decreased to thousand in as compared to million in gross profit on research  development and other revenue decreased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million in other gross margin increased to for as compared to in the primary reason for the increase in gross margin was revenue related to the allergopharma portfolio from deferred licensing fees for which a corresponding capitalized patent cost was amortized  which occurred in  but not in this was somewhat offset by the acceleration of certain previously deferred upfront licensing fees which were recognized in due to the sale of the allergopharma portfolio in december we expect gross margin to be flat or down slightly for as compared to operating expenses selling and marketing expenses increased by to million in compared to million in key factors in the change were an increase in personnel and increased expenditures on market research 
selling and marketing expenses increased by to million in as compared to million in a key factor in the increase was cost related to new product launches 

table of contents research and development expenses decreased by thousand to million in from million in a key factor in the change was less space at our corporate headquarters being used for research and development activities 
in late  we implemented a plan to move and expand space for certain activities within our corporate headquarters  which reduced the space dedicated to research and development activities 
research and development expenses decreased by thousand to million in from million in a factor in the decline was a decrease in accrued expenses related to our management incentive program mip recognized in as compared to general and administrative expenses were million in  a slight decrease as compared to a factor in the decline was no mip payouts were earned in while there was some corresponding mip payout earned in general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in from million in key factors in the decline were lower incentive compensation  including compensation related to our mip  in as compared to  and lower legal fees  primarily related to our litigation with uv in in  we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately thousand  consisting of approximately thousand related primarily to personnel severance and other costs for certain individuals affected by our restructuring in december and thousand related to inventory of discontinued products  including a monitoring product the manufacturer has informed us it no longer intends to support 
we recorded no restructuring expenses in or other operating expenses of approximately thousand in relate to an asset impairment charge related to certain rental instruments we own 
in  we recognized a gain of approximately thousand on the sale of certain patents we held net of costs on this line 
in  we recognized a gain of approximately thousand on the sale of the allergopharma portfolio on this line 
the gain is equal to the sales price less the net book value of the allergopharma portfolio  which included all of our unamortized capitalized patent costs 
we expect operating expenses will be lower than in  primarily as a result of our restructuring at the end of interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net was thousand in  as compared to thousand in and million in this line item includes interest expense  interest income and foreign currency gains and losses 
the largest factor in the increase in as compared to was greater borrowings under our revolving line of credit with wells fargo  somewhat offset by lower market interest rates 
the largest factor in the decrease from to was lower borrowings under our credit and security agreement with wells fargo along with the fact that we repaid thousand in subordinated debt in may another factor was lower interest rate spreads to prime on our borrowings with wells fargo resulting from our achievement of negotiated milestones 
we expect interest and other expense  net to decrease in as compared to based on lower market interest rates and lower average borrowings  somewhat offset by an increase in our interest rate spread 
income tax expense benefit in general  income tax expense or benefit can be broken into two categories current and deferred 
valuation allowance adjustments and net operating loss usage have been components of deferred income tax expense benefit in all years presented 

table of contents current income tax expense generally consists of taxes payable on tax returns for a given year 
these primarily relate to domestic federal alternative minimum tax payments required  although state taxes are also included in this category 
we have typically not had to pay much in cash taxes when we have generated taxable income due to our nol in switzerland and in the united states 
a valuation allowance adjustment is due to a change in circumstances that causes a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years 
based on the profitable operating performance of our subsidiary in switzerland  in the fourth quarter of we concluded that our nol in switzerland was realizable on a more likely than not basis 
we reduced the related valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of this resulted in a net deferred tax asset equal to the estimated quantity of income taxes we would have recognized in our future statements of operations as income tax expense that we would not have to actually pay in cash assuming our estimate of our nol usage in switzerland was exactly correct 
we subsequently obtained agreements from the tax authorities in the canton of fribourg the tax agreements regarding the determination of our taxable income which reduced our taxable income in switzerland in and from previous estimates for financial reporting purposes and we expected to reduce our taxable income  and thus our tax obligation  in future years as compared to prior expectations 
given our corresponding lower income expectations in switzerland  we no longer believed we would utilize all of our nol in switzerland before it was scheduled to expire at the end of accordingly  we reduced our net deferred tax asset related to this nol via an increase in the related valuation allowance which is reported as a valuation allowance adjustment income tax expense of thousand in the fourth quarter of we did not generate sufficient taxable income in to fully utilize our swiss net deferred tax asset  which expired at the end of  and made an associated reduction in the deferred tax asset and recorded a corresponding income tax expense journal entry of thousand in the fourth quarter of net operating loss usage represents the tax we would have paid had we not had an nol in a given jurisdiction  but did not pay 
we had net operating loss usage in switzerland of thousand  thousand and thousand in  and  respectively 
the amount decreased from to due to the tax agreements 
the amount increased from to due to the expiration of a tax holiday from canton  municipal and church income taxes in the canton of fribourg in august in the fourth quarter of  based on the company s profitable domestic operating performance  we concluded that a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of our domestic nol  was realizable on a more likely than not basis and the related valuation allowance was  resulting in an income tax benefit of million  reported as a valuation allowance adjustment income tax benefit 
this resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million for our domestic deferred tax assets 
in  domestic deferred income tax benefits related to our loss before income taxes was the primary reason we recorded a thousand income tax benefit 
in  the million valuation allowance adjustment related to our domestic nol discussed above was the primary reason for the million income tax benefit recorded 
in  deferred tax expenses discussed above related to our swiss subsidiary were the primary components of thousand in income tax expense 
in  we expect current income tax expense as compared to an income tax benefit in as we expect to generate income before income taxes as opposed to the loss before income taxes we experienced in 
table of contents or benefit in and expect to record valuation allowance adjustment income tax expense or benefit infrequently  if at all  in future years 
net income loss our net loss was thousand as compared to net income of million in and million in the decline in as compared to was due to the large valuation allowance adjustment related to our domestic nol recognized in  but not lower total revenue  lower gross margin and higher operating expenses for as compared to also contributed to the change 
a large valuation allowance income tax benefit was the primary reason for the increase from to  although increased revenue also contributed to the improvement 
in  we expect to generate net income as opposed to the net loss we reported in  primarily as a result of lower operating expenses 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we have incurred net cumulative negative cash flow from operations since inception in for the year ended december   we had total revenue of million and net loss of thousand 
in  net cash provided by operations was million 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of million  million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  discussed below  and million of other debt and capital leases 
net cash flows from operating activities provided cash of million in as compared to using cash of million in and providing cash of million in the major factors in the improvement in versus were a million improvement in cash provided by inventory as we lowered our inventory levels at year end compared to year end  a million improvement in cash provided by accrued liabilities and other related items primarily due to a relatively large cash payout for our mip in early  a million improvement in cash provided by accounts receivable primarily due to lower fourth quarter sales and million greater depreciation and amortization primarily related to full versus partial year depreciation on rental instruments we capitalized in this was somewhat offset by a million decrease in net income  partially mitigated by a million decrease in deferred tax benefit primarily due to the million valuation allowance adjustment related to our domestic nol recorded in  as well as a million increase in cash used for accounts payable which primarily relates to lower inventory received but not paid for at year end as compared to the major factors in the use of cash in as compared to providing cash of million in were an increase in cash used for inventories of million due primarily to the non cash transfer of inventory to property and equipment related to rental programs on certain of our diagnostic instruments as well as greater overall inventory levels  decreases in cash provided from accrued liabilities and other related items of million primarily due to decreases in accrued management incentive plan payouts  somewhat offset by a million improvement in our net income which was mostly offset by a corresponding deferred tax benefit change of million  a million improvement in cash provided by accounts receivable resulting from a lower days outstanding accounts receivable balance and a million improvement in cash provided by accounts payable related to increased spending 
net cash flows from investing activities used cash of thousand in as compared to using cash of million in and providing cash of thousand in expenditures for property and equipment totaled approximately thousand  million and million in  and  respectively 
the cash used in was entirely for purchases of property and equipment  which decreased from million as compared to a factor in the decrease was the launch of three major instruments in for which we capitalized demonstration and other units  with no corresponding instrument launches in the cash used in was entirely for purchases of property and equipment  which increased from due to the purchases of demonstration units for the three new diagnostic instruments we launched in and increased purchases related to our des moines manufacturing operations in as compared to in  the sale of certain intellectual property generated cash  after related costs  of approximately 
table of contents million which was slightly larger than approximately million in capital expenditures and capitalized patent costs 
net cash flows from financing activities used cash of million in as compared to providing million in and using million in in we used cash to reduce our borrowings under our line of credit by million and repay principal on term debt of thousand which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon option exercises and in our employee stock purchase plan totaling thousand 
in  we increased our line of credit borrowings by million and received thousand from the issuance of common stock upon option exercises and in our employee stock purchase plan 
these cash inflows were somewhat offset by the repayment of principal on term debt of million 
in  we reduced our line of credit borrowings by million and repaid principal on term debt of thousand which was somewhat offset by thousand in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon option exercises and in our employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock decreased in as compared to and primarily due to lower proceeds from option exercises 
we repaid approximately thousand more term debt in than in and because a thousand term loan from a customer matured and was repaid in at december   we had a million asset based revolving line of credit with wells fargo which has a maturity date of june  at december   million was outstanding under this line of credit 
our ability to borrow under this line of credit varies based upon available cash  eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
on december   interest was charged at a stated rate of prime plus and was payable monthly 
we are required to comply with various financial and non financial covenants  and we have made various representations and warranties 
among the financial covenants is a requirement to maintain a minimum liquidity cash plus excess borrowing base of million 
additional requirements include covenants for minimum capital monthly and minimum net income quarterly 
failure to comply with any of the covenants  representations or warranties could result in our being in default on the loan and could cause all outstanding amounts payable to wells fargo  including those discussed below  to become immediately due and payable or impact our ability to borrow under the agreement 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  at december   our remaining available borrowing capacity based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory under our revolving line of credit was approximately thousand 
at december   we also had outstanding obligations for long term debt and capital leases totaling approximately million primarily related to three term loans with wells fargo 
one term loan is secured by real estate in iowa and had an outstanding balance at december  of approximately thousand due in monthly installments of  plus interest 
the term loan had a stated interest rate of prime plus on december  and is to be paid in full in april the other two term loans are secured by machinery and equipment at our des moines  iowa and loveland  colorado locations the equipment notes 
principal payments on the equipment notes of  plus interest are due monthly 
the equipment notes had a stated interest rate of prime plus on december  and are to be paid in full in august our capital lease obligations totaled approximately thousand at december  at december   we had deferred revenue and other long term liabilities  net of current portion  of approximately million 
included in this total is approximately million of deferred revenue related to up front fees that have been received for certain product rights and technology rights out licensed 
these deferred amounts are being recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining lives of the agreements  products  patents or technology 
our primary short term need for capital  which is subject to change  is to fund our operations  which consist of continued sales and marketing  general and administrative and research and development efforts  working capital associated with increased product sales and capital expenditures relating to maintaining and 
table of contents developing our manufacturing operations 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our marketing and selling efforts  as well as those of third parties who market  sell and distribute our products  are successful in increasing our revenue  the extent to which currently planned products and or technologies under development are successfully developed and achieve market acceptance  changes required by us by regulatory bodies to maintain our operations and other factors 
our financial plan for indicates that our available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash from operations and borrowings expected to be available under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operations through and into our financial plan for expects that we will have positive cash flow from operations 
however  our actual results may differ from this plan  and we may be required to consider alternative strategies  such as further reductions in our personnel costs 
we may be required to raise additional capital in the future 
if necessary  we expect to raise these additional funds through the sale of equity securities or refinancing loans currently outstanding on assets with historical appraised values significantly in excess of related debt 
there is no guarantee that additional capital will be available from these sources on acceptable terms  if at all  and certain of these sources may require approval by existing lenders 
if we cannot raise the additional funds through these options on acceptable terms or with the necessary timing  management could also reduce discretionary spending to decrease our cash burn rate through actions such as delaying or canceling budgeted research activities or marketing plans 
these actions would likely extend the then available cash and cash equivalents  and then available borrowings to some degree 
see risk factors in item a of this form k for a discussion of some of the factors that affect our capital raising alternatives 
a summary of our contractual obligations at december  is shown below payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations interest payments on debt line of credit operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to those agreements considered above where our contractual obligation is fixed  we are party to commercial agreements which may require us to make milestone payments under certain circumstances 
all milestone obligations which we believe are likely to be triggered but are not yet paid are included in unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
we do not believe other potential milestone obligations  some of which we consider to be of remote likelihood of ever being triggered  will have a material impact on our liquidity  capital resources or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had a net domestic operating loss carryforward  or nol  of approximately million  a domestic alternative minimum tax credit of approximately thousand and a domestic research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately thousand 
our nol is scheduled to expire in various years beginning in and ending in  with the majority scheduled to expire in or later 
the nol and tax credit carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
in addition  we had a change of ownership as defined under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended an ownership change 
we believe the latest ownership change occurred at the time of our initial public offering in july 
table of contents we do not believe this ownership change will place a significant restriction on our ability to utilize our nols in the future

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and foreign interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on certain of our lines of credit and other borrowings is variable based on the united states prime rate and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately million was outstanding on these lines of credit and other borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents at december   the majority of which was invested in liquid interest bearing accounts 
we had no interest rate hedge transactions in place on december  we completed an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis based on the above and an assumed one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates 
if market rates increase decrease by one percentage point  we would experience an increase decrease in annual interest expense of approximately thousand based on our outstanding balances as of december  foreign currency risk our investment in foreign assets consists primarily of our investment in our european subsidiary 
foreign currency risk may impact our results of operations 
in cases where we purchase inventory in one currency and sell corresponding products in another  our gross margin percentage is typically at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  in cases where we may be generating operating income in foreign currencies  the magnitude of such operating income when translated into us dollars will be at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
our agreements with suppliers and customers vary significantly in regard to the existence and extent of currency adjustment and other currency risk sharing provisions 
we had no foreign currency hedge transactions in place on december  we have a wholly owned subsidiary in switzerland which uses the swiss franc as its functional currency 
we purchase inventory in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and euros  and sell corresponding products in us dollars 
we also sell products in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and euros  where our inventory costs are in us dollars 
based on our results of operations  if foreign currency exchange rates were to strengthen weaken by against the dollar  we would expect a resulting pre tax loss gain of approximately thousand
