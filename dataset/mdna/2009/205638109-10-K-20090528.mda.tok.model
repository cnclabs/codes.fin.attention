professional services segment revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states europe and africa other international operations total professional services segment revenue during  the professional services segment generated a contribution margin of  compared to and during and  respectively 
the decrease in contribution margin for compared to was due to higher costs in associated with the investment in personnel for our solutions delivery group  which focuses on providing professional services associated with our product solutions  and to a lesser extent  the completion and transitioning of certain higher margin contracts during and see the professional services segment revenue section for more details 
the decrease in contribution margin for compared to was due to a disproportionate percentage decline in revenue compared to costs 
the percentage decline in revenue exceeded the percentage decline in costs due to annual salary increases and higher costs associated with certain fixed price projects partially offsetting the reductions in compensation costs associated with headcount reductions in restructuring during the second half of  management focused on improving the segment s margins by initiating a plan to exit engagements that were considered low margin or unprofitable and reducing headcount and operating costs resulting in restructuring charges 
our professional services segment contribution margin increased to during the fourth quarter of compared to a contribution margin for the first nine months of the fourth quarter results included a million increase to revenue due to an adjustment associated with the completion of a fixed price project 
professional services revenues are expected to decline in the range of to in compared to but we expect improvement in the operating margin percentage of the segment 
actions initiated to date have included exiting low margin accounts  including our largest professional services client in the automotive industry 
we expect to of our professional services segment revenue in to be concentrated in the automotive industry 
if these actions do not improve the operating profit percentage of the professional services segment as currently projected  an impairment of some or all of the million of goodwill related to the professional services segment at march  may be recorded in the future as a non cash charge to earnings in the period in which the carrying value exceeds fair value

the decrease in revenue for compared to was primarily due to a general slow down in customer spending on certain it programs and on staff supplementation services within our us operations 
professional services segment expenses professional services segment expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs of providing services  including billable staff  subcontractors and sales personnel 
professional services segment expense decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decreases in cost for and were primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit costs due to a reduction in employee headcount as management continues to restructure the segment in order to align operating costs with the decline in revenue as part of the restructuring efforts

restructuring charge restructuring initiative during  we incurred restructuring charges of million associated with the following two initiatives aligning the professional services segment headcount and operating expenses after initiating a plan to exit low margin engagements and management s continued evaluation of the product segment and general and administrative business processes to identify operating efficiencies with the goal of reducing operating expenses 
these actions resulted in the full or partial closing of seven offices and the termination of positions within our professional services segment  positions within our products segment related to technology and sales and marketing personnel  and corporate general and administrative positions 
the company continues to review the impact of these actions and will  based on future results of operations  determine if additional actions are needed 
the total amount of any potential future charges for such actions will depend upon the nature  timing and extent of those actions 
restructuring initiative during  we undertook various restructuring initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of a number of our critical business processes  primarily within the products segment 
these initiatives included the realignment and centralization of certain product development activities leading to the full or partial closing of certain development labs and termination of approximately employees  primarily programming personnel

table of contents management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
product revenue recognition in order for a transaction to be eligible for revenue recognition  the following criteria must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
based on our interpretation of us gaap including statement of position software revenue recognition and modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin and emerging issues task force issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we believe our revenue has been properly reported 
new interpretations or pronouncements related to software revenue recognition policies could result in changes to our method of revenue recognition in the future 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg  maintenance and professional services is deferred 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and professional services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and professional services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or professional services and therefore  on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
for revenue arrangements where there is a lack of vsoe of fair value for any undelivered elements  license fee revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when vsoe of fair value can be established 
when maintenance or services are the only undelivered elements  the license fee revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the maintenance term or over the period in which the services are expected to be performed 
such transactions include term licenses as we do not sell maintenance for term licenses separately and therefore cannot establish vsoe for the undelivered elements in these arrangements 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate recognition of the software license fees  maintenance fees and as applicable  professional services fees under sop as amended 
however  to comply with sec regulation s x  rule b  which requires product  services and other categories of revenue to be displayed separately on the income statement  we separate the license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue based on its determination of fair value 
we apply our vsoe of fair value for maintenance related to perpetual license transactions and stand alone services arrangements as a reasonable and consistent approximation of fair value to separate license fee  maintenance fee and professional services fee revenue for income statement classification purposes 

table of contents we have an increasing need for flexibility in licensing rights and offerings to our customers 
as our contractual arrangements evolve to meet the needs of our customers  an increasing percentage of our license arrangements must be recognized over the terms of the arrangement 
while this ratable recognition has no impact on our results over time  it may change the timing of forecasted revenue and impact quarterly and annual results 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue 
license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been delivered to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
license revenue associated with term transactions is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
professional services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates  therefore  revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
for development services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and if determined that costs will exceed revenue  the expected loss is recorded at the time the loss becomes apparent 
certain engagements involve a project to setup the customer s structure and provide on going support for the project 
revenue associated with these projects is recognized over the service period as the customer derives value from the services  consistent with the proportional performance method 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete such projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for the collection and credit risk associated with our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
unforeseen events which negatively affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations would negatively impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts due from customers and may cause a material impact on our financial position and results of operations due to a change in the assumptions and judgment on which we base this estimate 
capitalized software in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product that is generally five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future product revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter 
table of contents estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurs or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
at a minimum  we review for impairments each balance sheet date 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
the performance test involves a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the company performs step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we measure the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets using an estimate of the related discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations  where appropriate 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill associated with such reporting unit must be further evaluated for impairment 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg  economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
during  our professional services segment revenues and contribution margins declined as current economic conditions impacted the customer base 
we began to realign our professional services business model during the second half of  resulting in the exiting of engagements considered low margin or unprofitable 
we also undertook restructuring actions to reduce headcount and operating costs see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
we completed step of the impairment test for the professional services segment at march  and concluded there was no impairment 
we determined the fair value of the professional services segment using a discounted cash flow analysis supported by market multiples of revenue 
the discounted cash flow analysis used our best estimates of market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in revenue and estimated changes in margins 
other significant estimates and assumptions included the discount rate and changes in future working capital requirements 
the analysis also considered the actions we took in see above and intend to execute in to improve the profitability of the professional services segment 
if our actions are not successful in improving the profitability percentage of the professional services segment or other adverse changes in market conditions not currently contemplated occur  an impairment of some or all of the million of goodwill related to the professional services segment at march  may be recorded in the future as a non cash charge to earnings in the period in which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in 
table of contents projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
for additional information regarding these matters see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these accruals and  therefore  to our net income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
in accordance with financial interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fin and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for stock awards in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
stock award compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate of are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of five years 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  volatility factor and expected option life years dividend yield is not a factor as we have never issued cash dividends and do not anticipate issuing cash dividends in the future 
for sfas r calculation purposes  the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in was per option share 
if we increased the assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the fair value of stock options granted in would decrease percent 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of march  and  cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities during was million  a decrease of million from the decrease was due to the following reduction in customer collections of million resulting from the decline in revenue  primarily professional services and license fees  and to a lesser extent timing of collections on trade receivables  increase in income taxes paid during compared to of million  cash paid for hedge contract settlements during of million  and a decrease in interest income of million primarily due to the lower cash and investment balance in compared to these decreases were partially offset by the following reductions in disbursements for employee payroll and benefits of million primarily resulting from the cost savings achieved through our and restructuring initiatives  reduction in vendor payments of million related to cost cutting initiatives implemented throughout the year to control our operating costs  and a reduction of million due to a litigation settlement in the first quarter of the consolidated statements of cash flows included in item of this report computes net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method 
therefore non cash adjustments and net changes in assets and liabilities net of the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations are adjusted from net income to derive net cash from operating activities 
changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenue have typically had the largest impact on the reconciliation of net income to compute cash flows from operating activities as we allow for deferred payment terms on multi year products contracts 
the increase in the net change of accounts receivable of million and the decrease in the net change of deferred revenue of million from as compared to are primarily due to a decrease in the dollar value of multi year products transactions 
the other significant change in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during as compared to relates to the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses causing cash flows from operating activities to decrease by million 
this change was primarily due to a larger restructuring initiative in compared to and higher commission and bonus expenses in compared to  causing the associated accruals to be higher at march  as compared to march  as of march   million was accrued related to restructuring actions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
we continue to evaluate our business processes to identify ways to reduce costs 
any further actions will likely result in additional restructuring charges 
the amount of such charges will depend upon the nature  timing and extent of the restructuring actions taken 
we believe our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet operating cash needs for the foreseeable future

 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp no 
that amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
fsp no 
requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under sfas no 
r 
the fsp also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset s expected future cash flows are affected by an entity s intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement 
fsp no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
the company does not expect the adoption of fsp no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition

sfas no 

this statement changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows

fsp 
fsp amends sfas no 
to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope  and was effective upon initial adoption of sfas no 
fsp provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas no 
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value  which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition

we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods the remaining amount of million will ultimately be settled 
these settlements are not included in the contractual obligations table above

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to manage the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
cash investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
our investment portfolio consists of cash investments that have a cost basis and fair value totaling million as of march  the average interest rate and average tax equivalent interest rate are and  respectively  as of march  these investments will mature within the next three months 
we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  of which approximately million  million  million  million and million are due in fiscal through  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated million negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated  positive impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk approximately of our revenue was derived from foreign sources in this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies related to the fair value of foreign assets and liabilities  net income and cash flows 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 

table of contents we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets 
we also have non us subsidiaries with financial instruments that are not denominated in their reporting currency 
at march   we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential loss of a positive or negative change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our income from operations 
based upon the analysis performed  such a change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
