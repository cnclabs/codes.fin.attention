item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations 
the other debt facilities mature over differing periods through if we are unable to renew the million line of credit or other facilities or are unable to secure alternative sources of capital funding under satisfactory terms  or at all  we may be unable to meet short term cash needs required for operations or growth opportunities 
this may adversely impact our financial results 
in addition  if we do not meet the debt covenant requirements under the line of credit  we could face adverse effects on our financial statements  including payments for waivers or higher interest rate obligations 
we believe we will obtain financing to replace or extend this line of credit that will allow us to meet our short term cash needs 
however  the current poor conditions of the us credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing 
if the value of our portfolio of investment securities declines  our results of operations will suffer 
approximately   and of our total assets as of december   and  respectively  consisted of investment securities 
during  we made investments in corporate debt 
we periodically review investments available for sale for other than temporary declines in fair value and write down investments to their fair value when such a decline occurs 
during the year ended december   we recognized a loss totaling million representing the entire basis amount on a lehman brothers corporate debt security that was determined to be other than temporarily impaired due to their bankruptcy announcement 
we do not consider the remainder of our investments to be other than temporarily impaired because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or maturity 
we did not record any other than temporary impairments for the years ended december  or future adverse changes in market conditions  or poor operating results of companies in which we have invested  could result in losses 
moreover  we implemented a more conservative investment policy in late  and the resulting lower returns may adversely impact our financial results 
over of our revenue in the past several years over in has been received from our two largest clients 
the loss or reduction in business from any of these clients would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the following table represents revenue concentration of our principal clients year ended december  at t inc formerly cingular wireless  llc and at t corp 
t mobile  a subsidiary of deutsche telekom the loss of a principal client  a material reduction in the amount of business we receive from a principal client  or the loss  delay or termination of a principal client s product launch or service offering would adversely affect our business  revenue and operating results 
we may not be able to retain our principal clients or  if we were to lose any of our principal clients  we may not be able to timely replace the revenue generated by the lost clients 
loss of a principal client could result from many factors  including consolidation or economic downturns in our clients industries  as discussed further below 
our work for at t inc at t is covered by several contracts for a variety of different lines of at t business  some of these contracts expire in and others in for example  we entered into a contract covering certain customer care services with at t mobility llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of at t  in may that expires in april previously  in december  we entered into another contract covering certain business care services that has been extended through march  while the parties negotiate a new agreement for such services 
we entered into a services agreement and statement of work with t mobile the t mobile contract for the provision of certain call center services  each having an initial term expiring september   that automatically renews from year to year  subject to non renewal by either party 
we are working diligently to complete negotiation of the new agreements for business care services and other lines of business for which individual statements of work expire in  and we expect to renew each of them in due course 
however  if we fail to do so or if any are not renewed  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the future revenue we generate from our principal clients may decline or grow at a slower rate than expected or than it has in the past 
in the event we lose any of our principal clients or do not receive call volumes anticipated from these clients  we may suffer from the costs of underutilized capacity because of our inability to eliminate all of the costs associated with conducting business with that client  which could exacerbate the effect that the loss of a principal client would have on our operating results and financial condition 
for example  there are no guarantees of volume under the current contract with at t 
in addition  that contract with at t provides for a tiered incentive pricing structure that provides for lower pricing at higher volumes 
additional productivity gains will be necessary to offset the negative impact that lower per minute revenue at higher volume levels will have on our margins in future periods 
we are currently carrying a significant amount of net operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes 
if we are not able to generate sufficient future taxable income to offset these losses  our financial results may be adversely affected 
as of december   we had gross federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
these carry forwards can be used to offset future taxable income and expire in we have not recorded a valuation allowance related to the net operating loss carry forwards and other temporary items as management believes it is more likely than not that we will be able to use the benefit to reduce future tax liabilities 
we believe it is more likely than not based upon our current estimates of future taxable income that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance may be required if we are unable to generate future taxable income 
a tax valuation allowance could have a significant negative impact on future earnings 
our client base is concentrated in the communications industry  which has recently experienced consolidation trends 
as our clients businesses change as a result of merger and acquisition activity  there is no guarantee that the newly formed companies will continue to use our services 
consolidation in the communications industry may decrease the potential number of buyers for our services 
likewise  there is no guarantee that the acquirer of one of our clients will continue to use our services after the consolidation is completed 
we are particularly vulnerable on this issue given the relatively few significant clients we currently serve and the concentration of these clients in the telecommunications industry 
for example  in late  our client  at t 
acquired another of our clients  cingular wireless  llc now  at t mobility  llc  thereby further concentrating our revenue base 
there can be no assurance that at t mobility  llc  at t  or other subsidiaries of at t 
will continue to use our services in the future 
if we lose principal clients or our service volumes decrease as a result of principal clients being acquired  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we expect to negotiate renewals of our contracts in due course  however  if any of such contracts or any order under such a contract is not ultimately renewed  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our client base is concentrated in the communications industry and our strategy partially depends on a trend of communications companies continuing to outsource non core services 
if the communications industry suffers a downturn or the trend toward outsourcing reverses  our business will suffer 
our current clients are almost exclusively communications companies  which include companies in the wire line  wireless  cable and broadband lines of business 
over of our revenue in was concentrated in the telecommunications industry 
our business and growth is largely dependent on continued demand for our services from clients in this industry  and other industries that we may target in the future  and on trends in those industries to purchase outsourced services 
a general and continuing economic downturn in the telecommunications industry or in other industries that we target  or a slowdown or reversal of the trend in these industries to outsource services we provide  could adversely affect our business  results of operations  growth prospects  and financial condition 
a general and continuing economic downturn in other industries may result in excess capacity of contact center services in those industries attracting clients in the telecommunications industry or in other industries that we target 
if this happens  it could adversely affect our business  results of operations  growth prospects  and financial condition 
we have experienced significant management turnover and need to retain key management personnel 
on january   a 
laurence jones was appointed president  chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer as a successor to our former chief executive officer  steven d 
butler 
on september   we hired david g 
durham as our executive vice president  treasurer and chief financial officer 
we filled several other key management positions during and eliminated the position of chief information officer cio by integrating the functions managed by the cio with finance and operations 
during  we eliminated the position of chief operating officer coo and lost the services of the incumbent senior vice president  sales  a position we are actively seeking to fill 
high turnover of senior management can adversely impact our stock price  our results of operations and our client relationships  and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult 
in some cases  we may be required to pay significant amounts of severance to terminated management employees 
in addition  we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives 
changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business 
accordingly  our future financial performance will depend to a significant extent on our ability to motivate and retain key management personnel 
if we are not able to hire and retain qualified employees  our ability to service our existing customers and retain new customers will be adversely affected 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to recruit  hire  train  and retain qualified employees 
our business is labor intensive and  as is typical for our industry  continues to experience high personnel turnover 
our operations  especially our technical support and customer care services  generally require specially trained employees 
during  we continued to experience a high rate of employee turnover  which  in turn  requires significant recruiting and training costs 
such turnover adversely affects our operating efficiency  productivity and ability to fully respond to client demand  thereby adversely impacting our results of operations 
some of this turnover can be attributed to the fact that we compete for labor not only with other call centers  but also with other similar paying jobs  including retail  oil and gas industry labor  food service  etc 
as such  improvements in the local economies in which we operate can adversely affect our ability to recruit agents in those locations 
further increases in employee turnover or failure to effectively address and remedy these high attrition rates would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the addition of new clients or implementation of new projects for existing clients may require us to recruit  hire  and train personnel at accelerated rates 
we may not be able to successfully recruit  hire  train  and retain sufficient qualified personnel to adequately staff for existing business or future growth  particularly if we undertake new client relationships in industries in which we have not previously provided services 
because a substantial portion of our operating expenses consists of labor related costs  labor shortages or increases in wages including minimum wages as mandated by the us and canadian federal governments  employee benefit costs  employment tax rates  and other labor related expenses could cause our business  operating profits  and financial condition to suffer 
in the past  some of our canadian employees have attempted to organize a labor union and economic and legislative changes in the us may encourage organizing efforts in the future which  if successful  could further increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity 
our operating costs may increase as a result of higher labor costs 
during the past economic downturns  we  like a number of companies in our industry  sought to limit our labor costs by limiting salary increases and payment of cash bonuses to our employees 
during  the local economies in some of the locations in which we operate experienced growth  which caused us to increase labor rates to remain competitive within the local economies 
if these growth trends continue  we may need to further increase salaries or otherwise compensate our employees at higher levels in order to remain competitive 
effective july  the us federal minimum wage was increased  with additional increases expected in july the minimum wage applicable to most of our operations in canada is rising even more dramatically than in the us higher salaries or other forms of compensation are likely to increase our cost of operations 
if such increases are not offset by increased revenue  they will negatively impact our financial results 
conversely  if labor rates decrease due to higher unemployment in the current economic downturn  our cost of operations may decrease 
in the past  some of our canadian employees have attempted to organize a labor union and economic and legislative changes in the us may encourage organizing efforts in the future  which if successful could further increase our recruiting and training costs and could decrease our operating efficiency and productivity 
we may need to add specialized sales personnel in order to grow our business 
we may have difficulty recruiting candidates for these positions 
our future growth depends on our ability to initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships  as well as our ability to maintain relationships with our existing principal clients 
to generate opportunities for new business from existing clients  as well as obtain new clients  we may need to hire specialized sales and marketing staff to introduce new products and services 
if we are unable to hire sales people with the specialized skills and knowledge needed to attract new business  or if we are not able to develop new products and services  we will not be able to diversify our revenue base and thereby reduce our reliance on our significant customers 
we face considerable pricing pressure in our business  and if we are not able to continually increase productivity  our gross margins and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our strategy depends in part on our ability to increase productivity 
we face significant price pressure arising from our clients desire to decrease their operating costs  and from other competitors operating in our targeted markets 
price pressure may be more pronounced during periods of economic uncertainty 
in addition  our contract with our largest customer currently contains a tiered pricing structure  under which pricing declines as service volumes increase  creating increased pricing pressures in future years 
accordingly  our ability to maintain our operating margins depends on our ability to improve productivity and reduce operating costs 
if we are not able to achieve sufficient improvements in productivity to adequately compensate for potential price decreases  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facilities capacity utilization 
our profitability is influenced by our facility capacity utilization 
the majority of our business involves technical support and customer care services initiated by our clients customers  and as a result  our capacity utilization varies and demands on our capacity are  to some degree  beyond our control 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  periods of idle capacity from opening new facilities where forecasted volume levels do not materialize 
in addition  we have experienced  and in the future may experience  idle peak period capacity when we open a new facility or terminate or complete a large client program 
these periods of idle capacity may be exacerbated if we expand our facilities or open new facilities in anticipation of new client business because we generally do not have the ability to require a client to enter into a long term contract  or to require clients to reimburse us for capacity expansion costs if they terminate their relationship with us or do not provide us with anticipated service volumes 
from time to time  we assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our facilities 
accordingly  we may  if deemed necessary  consolidate or close under performing facilities in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
any such closures may result in lease termination costs  severance costs or impairment charges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal facility capacity utilization 
we and some of our former management employees are the subject of a class action lawsuit 
the defense and ultimate outcome of these allegations could negatively affect our future operating results 
we and six of our former directors and officers have been named as defendants in west palm beach firefighters pension fund v 
startek  inc  et al 
us district court  district of colorado filed on july   and john alden v 
startek  inc  et al 
us district court  district of colorado filed on july  those actions have been consolidated by the federal court 
the consolidated action is a purported class action brought on behalf of all persons except defendants who purchased shares of our common stock in a secondary offering by certain of our stockholders in june  and in the open market between february  and may  the class period 
the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading public statements about us and our business and prospects in the prospectus for the secondary offering  as well as in filings with the sec and in press releases issued during the class period  and that as a result  the market price of our common stock was artificially inflated 
the complaints allege claims under sections and of the securities act of and under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the plaintiffs in both cases seek compensatory damages on behalf of the alleged class and award of attorneys fees and costs of litigation 
on may   we and the individual defendants moved the court to dismiss the action in its entirety 
on march   the motion was denied with respect to the claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  except the claim under section a of the securities exchange act of was dismissed against two of the individual defendants 
on the same date  the motion was granted with respect to the claims under sections and of the securities act of without prejudice to plaintiffs filing an amended complaint with respect to such claims 
on may   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
on june   we and the individual defendants moved the court to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety 
on november   the motion was granted with respect to certain claims relating to representations regarding the company s supply chain management business  but was denied as to all other claims 
we believe we have valid defenses to the claims and intend to defend the litigation vigorously 
it is not possible at this time to estimate the possibility of a loss or the range of potential losses arising from these claims 
we may  however  incur material legal fees with respect to our defense of these claims 
the claims have been submitted to the carriers of our executive and organization liability insurance policies 
we expect the carriers to provide for certain defense costs and  if needed  indemnification with a reservation of rights 
the policies have primary and excess coverage that we believe will be adequate to defend this case and are subject to a retention for securities claims 
these policies provide that we are responsible for the first million in defense costs 
we have incurred defense costs related to these lawsuits in excess of our million deductible 
we have been involved from time to time in other litigation arising in the normal course of business  none of which is expected by management to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we generate revenue based on the demand for  and inquiries generated by  our clients products and services 
if our clients products and services are not successful or do not generate the anticipated call volumes  our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected 
in substantially all of our client relationships  we generate revenue based on the amount of products and services demanded by our clients customers 
the amount of our revenue also depends on the number and duration of customer inquiries 
consequently  the amount of revenue generated from any particular client is dependent upon consumers interest in and use of that client s products or services 
in addition  if the reliability of our customers products or services increases as a result of technological improvements  the volume of calls that we service may be reduced 
if customer interest in or increased reliability of any products or services offered by our clients and for which we provide outsourced services result in reduced service volumes  our revenue would be diminished 
we utilize forecasts made by our clients based on demand from their customers 
if the actual call volumes are materially different than the forecasted volumes  our financial results could be adversely affected 
in  we expanded our capacity to include four new facilities  in each of victoria  texas  mansfield  ohio  jonesboro  arkansas  and makati city  philippines 
as business associated with these additional facilities ramped  we experienced excess capacity and incurred additional costs as we worked towards bringing these facilities to normal operational levels 
in  we announced that we would be closing our sites in petersburg  virginia and regina  saskatchewan  as part of our efforts to achieve site optimization at all of our locations  and in big spring  texas  due primarily to recruiting challenges in these locations 
if client demand declines due to economic conditions  or otherwise  we would not leverage our fixed costs as effectively  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements and can generally be terminated by our customers on short notice without penalty 
we enter into written agreements with each client for our services 
we seek to sign multi year contracts with our clients  however these contracts generally permit termination upon to days notice by our clients  do not designate us as our clients exclusive outsourced services provider  do not penalize our clients for early termination  hold us responsible for work performed that does not meet pre defined specifications  and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments 
accordingly  we face the risk that our clients may cancel contracts we have with them  which may adversely affect our results 
in addition  some contracts with our two largest clients either expire in or are currently under negotiation for renewal  and we cannot guarantee that they will be extended or renewed 
if a principal client cancelled or did not renew their contract with us  our results would suffer 
in addition  because the amount of revenue generated from any particular client is generally dependent on the volume and activity of our clients customers  as described above  our business depends in part on the success of our clients products 
the number of customers who are attracted to the products of our clients may not be sufficient  or our clients may not continue to develop new products that will require our services  in which case it may be more likely for our clients to terminate their contracts with us 
moreover  clients who may not terminate their contacts with us without cause could generally reduce the volume of services they outsource to us  which would have an adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations  and overall financial condition 
our existing and potential clients are currently decreasing the number of vendors they are using to outsource their business process services 
if we lose more business than we gain as a result of this vendor consolidation  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
our existing clients and a number of clients we are currently targeting have been decreasing the number of firms they rely on to outsource their business process outsourced services 
we believe these clients are taking this action in order to increase accountability and decrease their costs  and under current economic conditions  there is an increased risk that our clients will outsource their business process outsourced services to even fewer firms to further reduce costs 
if this consolidation results in us losing one or more of our clients  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
in addition  this consolidation could make it more difficult for us to secure new clients  which could limit our growth opportunities 
if we do not effectively manage our growth or control costs related to growth  our results of operations will suffer 
we intend to grow our business by increasing the number of services we provide to existing clients  by expanding our overall client base and  in the future  through merger and acquisition activity 
growth could place significant strain on our management  employees  operations  operating and financial systems  and other resources 
to accommodate significant growth we would be required to open additional facilities  expand and improve our information systems and procedures  and hire  train  motivate  and manage a growing workforce  all of which would increase our costs 
our systems  facilities  procedures  and personnel may not be adequate to support our future operations 
further  we may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth  effectively manage our expanding operations  or achieve planned growth on a timely and profitable basis 
during recent years  we incurred costs related to excess capacity as we opened new facilities in anticipation of volume levels that did not materialize 
as a result  our operating profits declined  and our stock price was adversely impacted 
if we are unable to manage our growth efficiently  or if growth does not occur  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could suffer 
failure to implement technological advancements could make our services less competitive 
technologies that our clients or competitors already possess  or may in the future develop or acquire  may decrease the cost or increase the efficiency of competing services 
we believe that to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in technology to be able to compete for new business and maintain service levels for clients 
we may not be able to develop and market any new services that use  or effectively compete with  existing or future technologies  and such services may not be commercially successful 
furthermore  our competitors may have greater resources to devote to research and development than we do  and accordingly may have the ability to develop and market new technologies  with which we are unable to successfully compete 
our markets are highly competitive 
if we do not compete effectively  we may lose our existing business or fail to gain new business 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
we view in house operations of our existing and potential clients to be a significant competitive threat 
many of our clients or potential clients have in house capabilities  enabling them to perform some or all of the services that we provide 
our performance and growth could be impeded if clients  or potential clients  decide to shift in house  operations services currently outsourced  or if potential clients retain or increase their in house capabilities 
we anticipate that competition from low cost  offshore providers of outsourced services will continue to increase in the future and that such providers will remain an important competitive threat 
a number of our competitors have  or may develop  greater name recognition or financial and other resources than we have 
in addition  new competitors with greater name recognition and resources may decide to enter the markets in which we operate 
some competitors may offer a broader range of services than we do  which may result in clients and potential clients consolidating their use of outsourced services with larger competitors  rather than using our services 
competitive pressure from current or future competitors could also result in substantial price erosion  as discussed below  which could adversely affect our revenue  margins  and financial condition 
our operations in canada and the philippines subject us to the risk of currency exchange fluctuations 
because we conduct a material portion of our business in canada  we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
for the smaller portion of our business that we conduct in the philippines  we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of the philippine peso 
material fluctuations in exchange rates impact our results through translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign operations  and therefore may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we have contracts wherein the revenue we earn is denominated in us dollars  yet the costs we incur to fulfill our obligations under those contracts are denominated in canadian dollars or philippine pesos  as applicable 
therefore  the fluctuations in the us dollar to the canadian dollar or philippine peso exchange rates can cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations 
during  and  we engaged in hedging activities relating to our exposure to such fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
during  we did not enter into hedging agreements for the philippine peso 
we intend to participate in hedging activities in as it relates to the canadian dollar and the philippine peso 
however  currency hedges do not  and will not  eliminate our exposure to fluctuations in the currencies 
increases in the value of the canadian dollar or the philippine peso  or currencies in other foreign markets in which we may operate  in relation to the value of the us dollar  would further increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 
we face risks inherent in conducting business outside of north america 
our operations in canada accounted for   and  of our revenue in   and  respectively 
we have also opened a new facility in the philippines 
there are risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including competition from local businesses or established multinational companies  who may have firmly established operations in particular foreign markets 
this may give these firms an advantage regarding labor and material costs 
other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include significant changes in domestic government programs  policies  regulatory requirements  and taxation with respect to foreign operations  potentially longer working capital cycles  unexpected changes in foreign government programs  policies  regulatory requirements and labor laws  and difficulties in staffing and effectively managing foreign operations 
our current or potential new clients may be reluctant to have us provide services to them from a location outside of north america 
one or more of these factors may have an impact on our international operations 
our lack of significant international operating experience may result in any of these factors impacting us to a greater degree than they impact our competitors 
to the extent one or more of these factors impact our international operations  it could adversely affect our business  results of operations  growth prospects  and financial condition as a whole 
various other risk factors described in this annual report on form k may be exacerbated with regard to international operations  especially in countries where we do not have well established operations 
such risks include those related to the need to retain key management personnel  the inability to hire and retain qualified employees  increases in operating costs  facility capacity utilization  management of growth and costs related to growth  geopolitical military conditions  interruptions to our business  and the quality and cost of telephone and data services infrastructure 
our lack of a significant international presence outside of north america may adversely affect our ability to serve existing customers or limit our ability to obtain new customers 
although we currently conduct operations in canada and have begun operations in the philippines  we do not have a significant international presence 
our lack of significant international operations outside of north america could adversely affect our business if one or more of our customers decide to move their existing business process outsourcing services offshore 
our lack of a significant international presence outside of north america may also limit our ability to gain new clients who may require business process service providers to have this flexibility 
the movement of business process outsourcing services to other countries has been extensively reported in the press 
most analysts continue to believe that many outsourced services will continue to migrate to other countries with lower wages than those prevailing in the us 
accordingly  unless and until we develop significant international operations outside of north america  we may be competitively disadvantaged compared to a number of our competitors who have already devoted significant time and money to operating offshore 
if we decide to open facilities in  or otherwise expand into  additional countries  we may not be able to successfully establish operations in the markets that we target 
there are certain risks inherent in conducting business in other countries including  but not limited to  exposure to currency fluctuations  difficulties in complying with foreign laws  unexpected changes in government programs  policies  regulatory requirements and labor laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  growth prospects  results of operations  and financial condition 
our largest stockholder has the ability to significantly influence corporate actions 
a 
emmet stephenson  jr  one of our co founders  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  mr 
stephenson s spouse also owns shares of our common stock 
under an agreement we have entered into with mr 
stephenson  so long as mr 
stephenson  together with members of his family  beneficially owns or more but less than of our outstanding common stock  mr 
stephenson will be entitled to designate one of our nominees for election to the board 
in addition  our bylaws allow that any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock may call a special meeting of our stockholders 
the concentration of voting power in mr 
stephenson s hands  and the control mr 
stephenson may exercise over us as described above  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control that might otherwise benefit our stockholders 
our stock price has been volatile and may decline significantly and unexpectedly 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile  and could be subject to wide fluctuations  in response to quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in management  the degree of success in implementing our business and growth strategies  announcements of new contracts or contract cancellations  announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  the perception that significant stockholders may sell or intend to sell their shares  or other events or factors we cannot currently foresee 
we are also subject to broad market fluctuations  given the overall volatility of the current us and global economies  where the market prices of equity securities of many companies experience substantial price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
additionally  because our common stock trades at relatively low volume levels  any change in demand for our stock can be expected to substantially influence market prices thereof 
the trading price of our stock varied from a low of to a high of during geopolitical military conditions  including terrorist attacks and other acts of war  may materially and adversely affect the markets in which we operate  and our results of operations 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war  and any response to them  may lead to armed hostilities and such developments could cause substantial business uncertainty 
such uncertainty could result in potential clients being reluctant to enter into new business relationships  which would adversely affect our ability to win new business 
armed hostilities and terrorism may also directly impact our facilities  personnel and operations  as well as those of our suppliers and customers 
furthermore  severe terrorist attacks or acts of war may result in temporary halts of commercial activity in the affected regions  possibly resulting in reduced demand for our services 
these developments could impair our business and depress the trading price of our common stock 
if we experience an interruption to our business  our results of operations may suffer 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our facilities  computer equipment  telecommunications equipment  software systems and clients products and confidential client information against damage from internet interruption  fire  power loss  telecommunications interruption  e commerce interruption  natural disaster  theft  unauthorized intrusion  computer viruses  bomb threats and other emergencies 
we maintain procedures and contingency plans to minimize the detrimental impact of adverse events  but if such an event occurs  our procedures and plans may not be successful in protecting us from losses or interruptions 
in the event we experience temporary or permanent interruptions or other emergencies at one or more of our facilities  our business could suffer and we may be required to pay contractual damages to our clients  or allow our clients to renegotiate their arrangements with us 
although we maintain property and business interruption insurance  such insurance may not adequately or timely compensate us for all losses we may incur 
further  our telecommunication systems and networks  and our ability to timely and consistently access and use telephone  internet  e commerce  e mail  facsimile connections  and other forms of communication  are substantially dependent upon telephone companies  internet service providers  and various telecommunication infrastructures 
if such communications are interrupted on a short or long term basis  our services would be similarly interrupted and delayed 
increases in the cost of telephone and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business 
we depend on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies 
because of this dependence  any change to the telecommunications market that would disrupt these services or limit our ability to obtain services at favorable rates could affect our business 
we have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to the risks associated with rate fluctuations and service disruption by entering into long term contracts with various providers for telephone and data services 
there is no obligation  however  for these vendors to renew their contracts with us  or to offer the same or lower rates in the future  and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could seriously affect our business 
compliance with sec rules requiring that we and our independent auditors assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting may have adverse consequences 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of section requires our management  on an annual basis  to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we have completed the process of documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section  and the reports of our management and our independent auditors relating to our internal control over financial reporting are included elsewhere in this form k 
we constantly test and improve our controls as we identify certain deficiencies that we believe require remediation  and this requires additional management time and other resources 
if we incur significant expense relating to future compliance with section  our operating results will be adversely impacted 
in addition  as our business develops and grows  we will be required to adapt our internal control systems and procedures to conform to our current business  and we will continue to work to improve our controls and procedures and to educate our employees in an effort to maintain an effective internal control environment 
however  if internal control deficiencies arise in the future  we may not be able to remediate such deficiencies in a timely manner 
as a consequence  we may have to disclose in future filings with the sec any material weaknesses in internal controls over our financial reporting system 
disclosures of this type could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting  and may negatively affect our stock price 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud 
if we have deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting  it may negatively impact our business and operations 
our quarterly operating results have historically varied  and may not be a good indicator of future performance 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in revenue and operating results  as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include  changes in the amount and growth rate of revenue generated from our principal clients  the timing of receipt of payments from our clients  the timing of existing and future client product launches or service offerings  unanticipated volume fluctuations  expiration or termination of client projects  timing and amount of costs incurred to expand capacity in order to provide for further revenue growth from existing and future clients  and the seasonal nature of some clients businesses
