item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report company overview as discussed in item business  the company operates primarily in two industry groups  hvac and construction products 
within these two industry groups  the company has identified two reportable segments in each of the two industry groups the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment in the hvac industry group and the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and the door segment in the construction products industry group 
the heating and cooling segment produces and sells gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coils from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  wfc of colton  california 
the evaporative cooling segment produces and sells evaporative coolers from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pmi of phoenix  arizona 
sales of these two segments are nationwide  but are concentrated in the southwestern united states 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies are offered from numerous locations along the front range of colorado operated by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries collectively referred to as tmc and rmrm of denver 
doors are fabricated and sold along with the related hardware from colorado springs and pueblo through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mdhi of pueblo  colorado 
sales of these two segments are highly concentrated in the front range area in colorado although door sales are also made throughout the united states 
in addition to the above reporting segments  an unallocated corporate classification is used to report the unallocated expenses of the corporate office which provides treasury  insurance and tax services as well as strategic business planning and general management services and an other classification is used to report a real estate operation 
expenses related to the corporate information technology group are allocated to all locations  including the corporate office 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sales of the company s hvac products are seasonal and weather sensitive except for fan coils 
revenues in the company s concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment are influenced by the level of construction activity and weather conditions along the front range of colorado 
sales for the door segment are not as seasonal nor are they much affected by weather conditions 
historically  the company has experienced operating losses during the first quarter except when the weather is mild and demand strong along the front range 
operating results typically improve in the second and third quarters reflecting more favorable weather conditions in colorado and the seasonal sales of the evaporative cooling segment 
fourth quarter results can vary based on weather conditions in colorado as well as in the principal markets for the company s heating equipment 
the company typically experiences operating cash flow deficits during the first half of the year reflecting operating results  the use of sales dating programs extended payment terms related to the evaporative cooling segment and payments of the prior year s accrued incentive bonuses and company profit sharing contributions 
as a result  the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility tend to peak during the second quarter and then decline over the remainder of the year 
while this seasonal pattern of sales and operating profits prevailed in  cash flow lagged and the company s outstanding borrowings against its revolving credit facility peaked in september and fluctuated over the remainder of the year before declining in late december  primarily due to receipt of  from the sale of land in colorado springs  to end the year at  the higher level of debt during the year under the revolving credit facility was primarily due to a higher level of inventories partially offset by an increase in trade payables 
the increased inventory in the heating and cooling segment was primarily due to a lower than expected furnace sales during the peak selling season in the latter part of the year combined with an increase in raw materials to support the increased volume of fan coil sales 
the increase in the evaporative cooling segment was due to a decline in cooler sales combined with the increased purchase of raw materials in anticipation of increased volume for as a principal competitor went out of business at the end of increased steel prices and the increased purchase of some raw materials from overseas also added to the increase in raw materials inventory at year end 
overseas purchases require longer lead times and are often ordered in larger quantities to minimize shipping costs and assure the materials are available when needed by production 
cash and cash equivalents were  at the end of compared to  at the prior year end 
operations in provided  of cash compared to  in and  in the decrease in net cash generated by operating activities during was primarily the result of an increase in inventories of  compared to the increase of  in inventories during as discussed above 
the increase in net cash generated by operating activities during was primarily the result of a decrease in receivables of  compared to the increase in receivables of  during this increase in cash generated was partially offset by the net loss and an increase in inventory levels compared to net cash provided by investing activities was  compared to the use of  in and  in capital expenditures for  and were  including  that was included in accounts payable at january    and  respectively  exclusive of the  expended during for those assets purchased as part of the asci and cssl acquisitions 
current year expenditures were sharply curtailed during despite spending approximately  for a slurry wall and related expenditures associated with the next phase of mining at the pueblo aggregates operation 
capital expenditures during were predominantly in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
expenditures included over  to complete the industrial sand plant 
an additional  was expended to purchase an existing building in colorado springs for the company s door segment to replace a smaller and older facility 
expenditures during included  for the first outlay on an industrial sand plant while the remaining additions consisted primarily of routine equipment replacements largely in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
an additional  was used in for the purchase of the asci and cssl assets 
on january  the company purchased the assets of cssl for  in cash including  of goodwill and  for a non compete agreement 
on june   the company purchased certain assets of asci for  of cash and a  note which was paid off during in addition to the  of trucks  equipment and concrete plant  the asci purchase price included  for a non compete agreement   for a restrictive land covenant   for existing customer relations and  of goodwill 
investing activities provided cash from the proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of   and  during  and  respectively 
the sales included  received from the sale of land in colorado springs and the sale of the assets of a small aggregate operation for approximately  including the buyer s assumption of just over  of liabilities associated with the property 
this operation did not provide aggregates to the company s ready mix operations and management did not consider it to be a strategic part of the business 
proceeds from the sale of assets for included  received from the sale of stock received from the demutualization of an insurance company that provides life insurance benefits to our employees 
the sales were mainly of equipment replaced during the year 
budgeted capital expenditures for are approximately  which is approximately  less than planned depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the budget includes approximately  to complete the pueblo slurry wall and all related expenditures 
in addition approximately  will be spent in late to buy out two aggregates plants currently under lease 
the remaining expenditures will primarily be made for the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment for various equipment  tooling and facility improvements 
the company expects that the expenditures will be funded from existing cash balances  operating cash flow and funds available under the revolving credit facility 
during  cash of  was used in financing activities 
the company made scheduled term debt payments of  while also reducing the outstanding balance of the revolving line of credit by  during  cash of  was provided by financing activities 
as more fully discussed in note   was borrowed during against the revolving line of credit to finance operating and working capital needs and capital expenditures 
scheduled debt repayments of  were made during as well as the pay off of the remaining  owed on the note issued as part of the purchase price of asci 
an additional  was used to acquire treasury shares during during  cash of  was provided by financing activities 
under the amended credit agreement  discussed in the following section  the principal amount of the term loan was increased by  during  primarily to fund the acquisition of the assets of asci and to pay for the industrial sand plant 
see additional discussion of the term loan under revolving credit and term loan agreement  below 
scheduled debt repayments of  were made during in addition  scheduled payments of  were made against the  note issued as part of the purchase price of asci 
revolving credit and term loan agreement as of january  the company had a revolving credit and term loan agreement credit agreement with two banks as amended on august  amended credit agreement 
at january    was outstanding under the term loan facility 
under the amended credit agreement  the maximum amount available on the revolving credit facility was  which was reduced to  as of december  borrowings under the amended credit agreement are secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  machinery  equipment and vehicles 
at january  the company was in compliance with the terms of the amended credit agreement which included covenants requiring the company to maintain certain levels of ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or debt service coverage  consolidated tangible net worth and to maintain certain ratios including consolidated debt to cash flow as defined 
additional borrowings  acquisition of stock of other companies  purchase of treasury shares and payment of cash dividends were either limited or require prior approval by the lenders 
at january   there was  outstanding against the revolving credit facility leaving  available after reserving  for the outstanding stand by letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility was available at the discretion of management and it was primarily used for funding the seasonal sales programs related to the evaporative cooler and furnace product lines 
as noted  the line was also used to secure stand by letters of credit primarily issued to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program 
during the fiscal year  the highest amount of company borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  not including the amount securing stand by letters of credit  was  and the average amount outstanding was  the amended credit agreement provided that  at the company s option  the term loan and revolving credit facility would bear interest at prime or a performance based libor rate 
based on the terms of the amended credit agreement and the company s performance for the twelve months ended january   the performance based rate would be libor plus for both the term loan and for borrowings under the revolving credit facility  subject to adjustment depending upon the company s performance 
payment of accrued interest was due and payable quarterly by the company and principal under the term loan was payable on a quarterly basis until march  on april  the company replaced the amended credit agreement with a new secured credit agreement new credit agreement whereby the new bank lender will provide a total credit facility of  consisting of a  revolving credit facility for a three year period reduced by letters of credit that may be issued by the lender on the company s behalf and a  term loan facility 
the company s outstanding stand by letters of credit of  reduce the current borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility such that the maximum that can be borrowed is  borrowings under the new credit agreement are secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  machinery  equipment  vehicles and certain real estate 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories 
inventory borrowings are limited to a maximum of  borrowings under the new credit agreement will bear interest based on a performance based libor or prime rate option 
the base libor rate will not be less than and the base prime rate will not be less 
at inception of the new credit agreement  the interest rate under the libor option will be and under the prime rate option 
the company also paid certain underwriting and arrangement fees at the time of closing 
the new credit agreement requires the company to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or debt service coverage and to maintain certain ratios including consolidated debt to cash flow as defined  and adjusted ebitda to interest expense and payments on funded debt 
additional borrowings  acquisition of stock of other companies  purchase of treasury shares and payment of cash dividends are either limited or require prior approval by the lender 
payment of accrued interest is due monthly or at the end of the applicable libor period on both the revolving credit borrowings and the term debt borrowings 
principal payments under the term loan are due quarterly with a final payment of all remaining unpaid principal due april  the company is required to enter into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate on a minimum amount of  of term debt 
the company has sufficient qualifying assets such that the entire  or the revolving credit facility is immediately available and is expected to be available for the foreseeable future 
at the time of signing  the new credit agreement is expected to provide additional borrowing capacity of approximately  after payment of the underwriting and arrangement fees as compared to the amount available under the amended credit agreement 
see note a standby letter of credit in the amount of  previously issued to an insurance company to support self insured amounts under the company s risk management program  was drawn upon by the beneficiary in connection with the company s new credit agreement 
the proceeds of the letter of credit  which now serve as cash collateral for the company s self insurance obligations  are treated as a revolving credit loan under the new credit agreement 
due to the terms of the new credit agreement  the year end borrowings of  against the revolving credit line have been classified as long term on the january  balance sheet 
the company has prepared a projection of cash sources and uses for the next months 
under this projection  the company believes that its existing cash balance  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the new credit agreement  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
the company also expects to be in compliance with all debt covenants during this period 
insurance policies the company maintained insurance policies since march  with the following per incident deductibles and policy limits deductible policy limits product liability general liability workers compensation statutory auto and truck liability should the aggregate out of pocket payments for the three policies exceed  during a policy year  deductibles on future claims are waived and the policies pay all amounts up to the policy limits 
should any  or all policy limits be exceeded  an umbrella policy is maintained which covers the next  of claims 
obligations and commitments the following tables represent our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments as of january  payments due by period as of january   giving effect to the new credit agreement as described in note are as follows amounts in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt including interest see note a revolving credit facility without interest see note operating leases see note minimum royalty agreement see note fin liability see note b total contractual obligations a interest on long term debt is computed using the interest rate in effect at january  the amount shown in the one year column includes the march payment under the amended credit agreement in effect at year end plus the scheduled payments as scheduled for the remaining quarters of under the new credit agreement 
although there is an outstanding balance at year end under our revolving credit facility  no interest amounts have been included related to the revolving credit facility because future paybacks and or borrowings under this facility are unknown at this time 
b the company has included  of uncertain tax liabilities under fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  that are classified as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
excluded from the table is  of uncertain tax liabilities  as the company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement 
amounts of commitment expiration per period as of january  amounts in thousands other commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years standby letters of credit a standby letter of credit in the amount of  issued to an insurance company to support self insured amounts under the company s risk management program  was drawn upon by the beneficiary in connection with the company s new credit agreement

off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements that would be likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations this section discusses consolidated results of operations 
the following sections discuss the operating results of the reporting segments and contain more detail 
consolidated sales were  in   in and  in the decrease in was due to the decreased level of construction along the front range of colorado and the united states in general 
sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment declined  or while door segment sales declined although this segment s sales are also more affected by the timing of shipments based on customers requests than our other segments 
sales in the heating and cooling segment increased  or entirely due to an increase in fan coil sales  which was the result of higher volume and prices in response to increased raw material costs 
the evaporative cooling segment reported a modest increase in sales despite a decline in volume 
price increases accounted for the higher revenue as a portion of the steel costs were reflected in the unit prices 
the increase in was primarily realized by the heating and cooling segment  and the door segment 
increased fan coil sales were the principal reason for the higher sales in the heating and cooling segment while a continued strong demand and the timing of shipments accounted for the door segment sales increase 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization remained relatively static as a percentage of sales at for both and decreases in cost of sales were experienced by the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment 
price increases were instituted for all products in these two segments in response to increased material costs incurred over the past year 
favorable workers compensation experience during the past year also reduced costs for both segments 
margins in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment declined due to lower volumes combined with higher delivery and utility costs 
also contributing to the lower margins in was the recovery of  in from an insurance claim for flood damages in pricing became more competitive as construction activity along the front range in colorado declined preventing price increases from fully recapturing the increased costs 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization in the door segment for was largely unchanged 
cost of sales increased for compared to as a percentage of sales from to 
the increase in cost of sales was experienced by all segments except the door segment 
increased material  healthcare and factory overhead costs drove margins lower in the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment 
higher cement and delivery costs lead to the decreased margins in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment despite the aforementioned recovery of  in from the insurance claim for flood damages in increased competitive pricing resulting from reduced construction activity along the front range in colorado prevented price increases from fully recapturing the increased costs 
the improvement in the door segment was largely due to the increase in sales 
depreciation  depletion and amortization declined modestly in compared to due to the curtailment of capital spending during depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in compared to due to the high level of capital expenditures and a full year s amortization of intangible assets associated with the asci and cssl acquisitions of selling and administrative costs declined but remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales at for compared to for selling and administrative costs increased as a percentage of sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment as well as the door segment due to the decline in sales and the relatively fixed nature of some of these expenses 
the decreased costs as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the increase in sales of the heating and cooling segment and evaporative cooling segment 
selling and administrative costs also declined due to the reduction of incentive compensation accruals at all segments  most notably at the corporate office which declined approximately  including a reduction in the supplemental profit sharing balances 
selling and administrative costs increased during as compared to but remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales at 
the increased costs were partially related to the increase in sales of the heating and cooling segment and the door segment 
however  increases in employee healthcare  compliance costs associated with sox  insurance and legal expenses associated with product liability claims were the primary causes for the increase in selling and administrative costs 
selling and administrative costs at the corporate office were relatively constant between and the gain on the disposition of property and equipment increased during because of a  pre tax profit on the sale of land in colorado springs 
the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment also realized a  pre tax gain related to the sale of the assets of a small aggregates operation during the first quarter of the aggregates operation did not provide aggregates to the company s ready mix operations and management did not consider it to be a strategic part of its business 
the gain on the disposition of property and equipment declined compared to as there were few sales during the year 
during  gains were realized on numerous dispositions of equipment that were replaced during the year 
at january   primarily due to the economic conditions in the denver area  the company determined that the carrying value of assets associated with rmrm within the company s concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment were below carrying value  resulting in an impairment charge 
the fair value was determined using the current fair value of similar assets in the marketplace 
the impairment reduced the book carrying value of property  plant and equipment by  and the covenant not to compete by  see the discussion in the property  plant and equipment section of note and note operating income improved to a profit of  for from a loss of  for operating results for declined from a profit of  during to a loss of  the dramatic decline was the result of the deterioration of margins in all but the door segment combined with the lower volume in the concrete business 
other income was lower in both and compared to due to  received during which included  received from the sale of stock received from the demutualization of an insurance company that provides life insurance benefits to our employees 
net interest expense increased modestly in over as a increase in average borrowings was partially offset by lower average interest rates during net interest expense for increased by  over the prior year due to increased borrowings as well as a higher average interest rate 
the company s effective income tax rates reflect federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the effective tax rate for was a benefit of 
the primary increase to the benefit from the statutory rate of was the benefit realized from the percentage depletion deduction  which had a large percentage effect due to the lower pre tax operating results 
various other factors influenced the rate with the notable item of a tax asset valuation allowance which reduced the benefit by 
the effective tax rate for was a benefit of 
the primary increases to the benefit from the statutory rate of was the benefit realized from percentage depletion and the benefit for future state tax credits resulting from operations within an enterprise zone in california 
the effective rate for was increased by for adjustments made to state taxes and reduced by for the benefit realized from the percentage depletion deduction 
the company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for potential tax contingencies 
based on these reviews and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit  reserves are adjusted as necessary 
reserves for these tax matters are included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note as discussed above  the company operates primarily in two industry groups both of which are somewhat seasonal  weather sensitive and subject to cyclical factors 
the following addresses various aspects of operating performance focusing on the reportable segments within each of the two industry groups 
construction products industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the construction products industry group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies door revenues from external customers segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment sales in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment for declined from the sales level of by  or to  concrete volume declined from the prior year s level with only the pueblo market reporting a gain due to two large jobs that will be completed during the first half of the sharp decline reflects the overall decline in construction due to the current economic recession and the deterioration in housing construction and the capital markets 
the gross profit in this segment was also negatively impacted by competitive pricing on larger jobs and increased costs of delivery and some materials 
the higher cost of diesel fuel was a significant contributor to the increased costs 
the cost of aggregates also increased as the section of the pueblo aggregates operation mined during contained a higher sand to rock ratio than previously mined 
we have opened a new area in which should yield a better mix of materials 
aggregates volume also declined nearly directly related to our lower concrete volume and other customers demand 
this segment is very sensitive to volume as many costs are relatively fixed in nature and the large decrease in sales volume was the primary cause of the reduced gross profit 
margins during were also reduced in comparison to due to the  insurance recovery during related to the flood damage 
the construction materials division also experienced a decrease in sales of approximately  however some well timed purchases of steel rebar actually improved the margins for this division 
sales during in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment declined  from the level to  despite increased sales prices 
the decline was attributable to a decline in concrete volume as construction along the front range of colorado slowed significantly during the year 
delivery costs increased due to higher prices for diesel fuel and a higher level of repairs and maintenance expenditures 
as the communities serviced expand  traffic increases and more of our sales occur further from our batch plant sites 
in the pueblo market  a significant portion of the increased delivery costs can be attributable to the quick turnaround times we enjoyed servicing two very large jobs in pricing became more competitive in all colorado markets as demand fell which prevented our price increases from fully recovering the increased costs 
the aggregates division reported improved sales during although profits were aided by the  insurance recovery related to the flood damage claims 
the construction supplies division reported declines in sales directly related to the lower construction activity during as noted above  operating income is highly sensitive to sales volume in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment 
this segment has also historically required a sizable investment in capital assets resulting in a significant portion of its costs being relatively fixed in nature 
operating income as a percent of sales  therefore  generally increases and decreases at a higher rate but in tandem with sales changes 
operations for resulted in a loss of  as compared to the operating income of  generated during as noted above volume was largely the cause although the recording of a  long lived asset impairment charge also negatively impacted the operating results of this segment 
competitive pricing combined with increased costs to also dampened margins 
the preceding negative events more than offset the segment s realization of a  pre tax gain related to the sale of a small aggregates operation during operating income for was  as compared to the operating profit of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased from in to in despite the insurance recovery of  from the flood damage claims 
as noted above  due to the increased competitive pricing caused by the decline in construction activity  higher costs were not able to be fully passed on to customers through higher prices 
in addition  depreciation expense rose approximately  in compared to due to the high capital spending in recent years and the amortization of intangibles related to the asci acquisition 
the segment also sold numerous assets during which resulted in gains of  compared to the small loss of  incurred during the operating loss resulted in negative results for both operations as a percent of sales and return on assets 
the reduced profit level of compared to resulted in lower operating income as a percent of sales and lower return on assets from the level 
door segment sales in the door segment declined  or during from the level as commercial and industrial construction declined nationwide due in part to the tight credit markets 
the sales backlog at the end of was over  which is higher than the amount at the end of  however  the rate of order capture has recently declined indicating an increasingly competitive bidding atmosphere 
sales in the door segment during increased  or over the level as demand remained strong and sales of electronic access systems increased 
sales are also affected by the timing of shipments as contractors may accelerate or delay shipments depending on the progress of their projects 
backlog was reduced over the course of but remained at a strong level 
due to the lower sales volume and a higher provision for workers compensation claims  the door segment reported  of operating income compared to  in operating income was  during compared to  during due principally to the increase in sales volume 
operating income as a percentage of sales for declined primarily due to the reduced volume 
selling and administrative costs were reduced by over  but increased as a percentage of sales 
depreciation increased due to the purchase of a new office and plant at the end of which was placed into service at the beginning of operating income as a percentage of sales for improved over the level as the electronic access products were assimilated into more projects and the company was able to leverage their electronics capability to increase sales and pricing 
due to decreased operating income during  both the operating income as a percent of sales and the return on assets during declined from the level 
the decrease in segment assets was due to lower receivables directly related to the lower level of sales 
although the operating income as a percent of sales increased during as compared to  due to the increase in sales  the return on assets during declined slightly from the level primarily due to the acquisition of the colorado springs facility during which increased the asset base of the segment 
hvac industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the hvac industry group for the fiscal years  and amounts in thousands 
heating and cooling evaporative cooling revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating loss operating loss as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets heating and cooling segment sales in the heating and cooling segment in increased to  an increase of  or from the  in the increase occurred in the fan coil line which was aided by a large hotel project in las vegas 
furnace unit volume declined approximately due to a mild winter in the southwest and the full force of the economic recession and deterioration of the capital markets occurring during the peak selling period for this product line 
margins improved modestly in in part due to selling price increases that offset higher commodity prices that we experienced in both and  particularly in steel and copper 
a reduction of factory overhead costs including favorable workers compensation experience also added to the improved margins 
despite the large increase in sales  selling and administrative expenses rose less than and decreased as a percentage of sales by over primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expenses 
sales in the heating and cooling segment improved to  an increase of  or from the  in furnace volume increased a modest while the fan coil line added over  in sales during profit margins  however  were lower compared to the reduced margins were due to significantly higher plant overhead costs  higher than expected material costs and more generous sales incentive plans offered to key furnace customers 
factory overhead expenses were significantly higher in part due to an increase in employee healthcare costs and workers compensation claims 
factory indirect payroll costs were higher due to additional personnel hired to accommodate the increased fan coil volume 
expenses associated with a business systems conversion and the implementation of a product configurator program for the fan coil line reduced the operating results 
selling expenses increased by almost of sales due to volume incentives and other marketing expenses related to programs offered to major furnace customers 
operating results for returned to a profit of  after the  loss incurred during the improvement was due to the solid growth in fan coil volume as well as the increased sales prices and cost savings noted above 
the operating results fell to a loss of  from the  profit reported for as noted above  the addition of personnel in anticipation of continued growth in fan coil sales  increased factory costs and pricing pressures primarily in the form of enhanced sales incentive programs all combined to diminish profit margins 
higher insurance premiums and legal costs associated with product liability claims contributed to the loss in the company also continued to be affected by raw material price increases 
pricing for certain products is generally determined and fixed at the time the contract is awarded 
the period of time from the awarding of a contract to the production and delivery of the product can vary 
commodity price increases during the intervening period will significantly impact the margins realized 
operating results as a percentage of sales and the return on assets both improved but only to near break even levels 
operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both negative for due to the loss incurred while both percentages were positive in due to the operating profit reported 
evaporative cooling segment sales in the evaporative cooling segment in increased to  up  or over the level despite a decline in unit volume 
a modest increase in selling prices and a change in product mix resulted in the increase in sales revenue 
margins improved by as factory overhead costs were lowered largely due to a significant decrease in charges for workers compensation costs 
the decline in workers compensation costs was the result of both fewer claims during the year and a lower cost of settling older claims than had been predicted at year end sales for increased slightly to  up  or over the amount of  the increase was due to modest sales price gains as unit sales were essentially equal to the level 
margins declined substantially due to higher material costs as well as higher employee benefit expenses 
workers compensation claims  self insured healthcare claims and maintenance costs were all higher in operating results for returned to a profit of  after the segment experienced an operating loss of  as noted above  the improvement is due to the increased prices and reduced overhead expenses 
selling and administrative costs were also reduced primarily due to lower incentive based compensation and employee benefits 
the operating results slipped from a profit of  in to a loss of  in as noted above  the increased costs combined with aggressive competition that limited sales price increases  were the causes for the decline 
operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both improved in compared to as a result of the operating income generated during compared to the loss incurred during similarly  operating results as a percent of sales and the return on assets were both negative for  and well below the level  due to the loss noted above 
outlook the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment continues to be adversely affected by the nation wide recession and the substantial decline in construction activity along the front range of colorado 
new residential construction remains depressed and is likely to remain weak throughout historically  pricing competition has escalated in times of diminished demand which would further adversely affect this segment 
although fuel costs have declined  the cost of diesel fuel has not declined in the same proportion and future prices remain unpredictable 
the door segment is also beginning to experience some slow down in bidding activity and more pricing competition 
with the exit of the leading manufacturer of evaporative coolers from the us market  some opportunities for increased sales in the evaporative cooling segment may be realized but the full impact of that company s departure is still unknown 
the heating and cooling segment will also likely be negatively affected by the overall weak economy and decline in commercial construction and weather will continue to be a significant factor 
increased steel prices have negatively impacted margins  however  recently there have been modest decreases in steel prices 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 issued by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized as a charge to earnings 
the company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment as of the last day of its fiscal year 
in addition  to the extent that events occur  either involving the relevant company subsidiaries or in their industries  the company revisits its assessment of the recorded goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred and should be immediately recognized 
this assessment requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates and costs 
in addition  the terms of recent industry transactions mergers are considered 
the company has goodwill associated with two of its reporting units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting segments using a combination of discounted cash flow models and a market valuation approach 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs and general market conditions 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus an appropriate control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in any of these assumptions could impact the estimated fair value 
the market valuation approach compares the company s financial results to entities of similar size and industry and also considers the impact of recent transactions in the industry 
additionally  the company considered the relation of the fair value of the company s reporting units to the market capitalization of the company 
no impairment was indicated as a result of the company s assessment in the current year 
a percent decrease in the fair value of estimates used for both reporting units would not have changed this determination 
if the assessment had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired  an impairment charge would have been recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value
