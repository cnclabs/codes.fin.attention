item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our operating strategy regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit  which began operations in our primary operating and investment goal is long term growth in earnings and total shareholder return  which we work to achieve by focusing on a strategy of owning  operating and developing high quality community and neighborhood shopping centers that are tenanted by market dominant grocers  category leading anchors  specialty retailers and restaurants located in areas with above average household incomes and population densities 
all of our operating  investing and financing activities are performed through our operating partnership  regency centers  lp rclp or partnership  rclp s wholly owned subsidiaries  and through its investments in real estate partnerships with third parties also referred to as co investment partnerships or joint ventures 
regency currently owns of the outstanding operating partnership units of rclp 
at december   we directly owned shopping centers the consolidated properties located in states representing million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
our cost of these shopping centers and those under development is billion before depreciation 
through co investment partnerships  we own partial ownership interests in shopping centers the unconsolidated properties located in states and the district of columbia representing million square feet of gla 
our investment in the partnerships that own the unconsolidated properties is million 
certain portfolio information described below is presented a on a combined basis  which is a total of the consolidated properties and the unconsolidated properties  b for our consolidated properties only and c for the unconsolidated properties that we own through co investment partnerships 
we believe that presenting the information under these methods provides a more complete understanding of the properties that we wholly own versus those that we indirectly own through entities we do not control  but for which we provide asset management  property management  leasing  investing and financing services 
the shopping center portfolio that we manage  on a combined basis  represents shopping centers located in states and the district of columbia and contains million square feet of gla 
we earn revenues and generate cash flow by leasing space in our shopping centers to market leading grocers  major retail anchors  specialty side shop retailers  and restaurants  including ground leasing or selling building pads out parcels to these potential tenants 
we experience growth in revenues by increasing occupancy and rental rates at currently owned shopping centers  and by acquiring and developing new shopping centers 
community and neighborhood shopping centers generate substantial daily traffic by conveniently offering necessities and services 
this high traffic generates increased sales  thereby driving higher occupancy and rental rate growth  which we expect will sustain our growth in earnings per share and increase the value of our portfolio over the long term 
we seek a range of strong national  regional and local specialty retailers  for the same reason that we choose to anchor our centers with leading grocers and major retailers who provide a mix of goods and services that meet consumer needs 
we have created a formal partnering process  the premier customer initiative pci  to promote mutually beneficial relationships with our specialty retailers 
the objective of pci is for us to build a base of specialty tenants who represent the best in class operators in their respective merchandising categories 
such retailers reinforce the consumer appeal and other strengths of a center s anchor  help stabilize a center s occupancy  reduce re leasing downtime  reduce tenant turnover and yield higher sustainable rents 
the current economic recession is resulting in a higher level of retail store closings and is limiting the demand for leasing space in our shopping centers resulting in a decline in our occupancy percentages and rental revenues 
additionally  certain national tenants negotiate co tenancy clauses into their lease agreements  which allow them to reduce their rents or close their stores in the event that a co tenant closes their store 
we believe that our investment focus on neighborhood and community shopping centers that conveniently provide daily necessities will help lessen the current economy s negative impact to our shopping centers  although the negative impact could still be significant 
we are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements closely monitoring the operating performance and tenants sales in our shopping centers including those tenants operating retail formats that are experiencing significant changes in competition  business practice  or reductions in sales 
we grow our shopping center portfolio through acquisitions of operating centers and new shopping center development  where we acquire the land and construct the building 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the anchor before we start construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our anchors and specialty retailers  resulting in modern shopping centers with long term anchor leases that produce attractive returns on our invested capital 
this development process can require three to five years from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up and stabilization of rental income  but can take longer depending upon the size of the project 
generally  anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to the completion of construction of the entire center  resulting in rental income during the development phase 
in the near term  reduced new store openings amongst retailers is resulting in reduced demand for new retail space and is causing corresponding reductions in new leasing rental rates and development pre leasing 
as a result  we are significantly reducing our development program by reducing the number of new projects started  phasing existing developments that lack retail demand  and reducing related general and administrative expense 
although our development program will continue to be a significant part of our business strategy  new development projects will be rigorously evaluated in regard to availability of capital  visibility of tenant demand to achieve occupancy  and sufficient investment returns 
we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure to fund our growth program  which should preserve our investment grade ratings 
our approach is founded on our self funding capital strategy to fund our growth 
the culling of non strategic assets and our industry leading co investment partnership program are integral components of this strategy 
we also develop certain retail centers because of their attractive profit margins with the intent of selling them to third parties upon completion 
these sales proceeds are re deployed into new  high quality developments and acquisitions that are expected to generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns 
to the extent that we are unable to execute our capital recycling program to generate adequate sources of capital  we will significantly reduce and even stop new investment activity until there is adequate visibility and reliability to sources of capital for regency 
joint venturing of shopping centers provides us with a capital source for new developments and acquisitions  as well as the opportunity to earn fees for asset and property management services 
as asset manager  we are engaged by our partners to apply similar operating  investment  and capital strategies to the portfolios owned by the co investment partnerships 
co investment partnerships grow their shopping center investments through acquisitions from third parties or direct purchases from us 
although selling properties to co investment partnerships reduces our direct ownership interest  we continue to share  to the extent of our ownership interest  in the risks and rewards of shopping centers that meet our high quality standards and long term investment strategy 
we have no obligations or liabilities within the co investment partnerships beyond our ownership interest 
the current lack of liquidity in the capital markets is having a corresponding effect on new investment activity in our co investment partnerships 
our co investment partnerships have significant levels of debt  of which will mature through  and are subject to significant refinancing risks 
we anticipate that as real estate values decline  the refinancing of maturing loans  including those maturing in our joint ventures  will require us and our joint venture partners to contribute our respective pro rata shares of capital in order to reduce refinancing requirements to acceptable loan to value levels required for new financings 
while we have been successful refinancing maturing loans  the longer term impact of the current economic crisis on our ability to access capital  including access by our joint venture partners  or to obtain future financing to fund maturing debt is unclear 
while we believe that our partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital requirements  we can provide no assurance that the constrained capital markets will not inhibit their ability to access capital and meet their future funding requirements

index to financial statements we expect that cash generated from operating activities will provide the necessary funds to pay our operating expenses  interest expense  scheduled principal payments on outstanding debt  and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers

during our annual dividend per common share increased by 
we expect to continue paying dividends to our shareholders based upon availability of cash flow and to maintain compliance with reit tax laws 
on february   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on march  to shareholders of record on february  and determined that it in light of the current recession and the strains it is placing on our business  they will not increase the dividend rate per share during  and may find it necessary to reduce future dividends or pay a portion of the dividend in the form of stock 
the board of directors continuously reviews regency s operations and will make decisions about future dividend payments on a quarterly basis 
at december  we had properties under construction or undergoing major renovations on a combined basis  which when completed  will represent a net investment of million after projected sales of adjacent land and out parcels 
this compares to properties that were under construction at december  representing an investment of billion upon completion 
we estimate that we will earn an average return on investment from our current development projects of on a fully allocated basis including direct internal costs and the cost to acquire any residual ownership interests held by minority development partners 
average returns have declined over previous years primarily as a result of higher costs associated with the acquisition of land and construction 
returns are also being pressured by reduced competition among retailers resulting in declining rental rates 
costs necessary to complete the current development projects  net of reimbursements and projected land sales  are estimated to be approximately million and will likely be expended through the costs to complete these developments will be funded from our million unsecured credit facilities defined under notes payable  which had million of available funding at december  the unsecured credit facilities mature in but million contains a one year extension option as discussed further below 
our strategy is to continue growing our shopping center portfolio by investing in shopping centers through new development or by acquiring existing centers  while at the same time selling non performing shopping centers and a percentage of our completed developments as a means to generate the capital required by this new investment activity 
in the near term  reduced store demand or failures among national retailers is resulting in reduced demand for new retail space and is causing corresponding reductions in new leasing rental rates and development pre leasing 
as a result  we have significantly reduced our development program by reducing the number of new projects started  phasing existing developments that lack retail demand  and reducing related general and administrative expense 
also  to the extent that we are unable to execute our capital recycling program in the current economic environment in order to generate new capital  or we find it necessary to provide financing to buyers of our shopping centers resulting in reduced sales proceeds  we will significantly reduce  and if necessary  stop new investment activity until the capital markets become less volatile 
we expect to repay maturing secured mortgage loans and credit lines primarily from similar new issues 
we have million of secured mortgage loans maturing through our joint ventures have million of secured mortgage loans and credit lines maturing through  and our pro rata share is million 
we believe that in order to refinance the maturing joint venture loans  we  along with our partners  will likely be required to contribute our pro rata share based on our respective ownership interest percentage of the capital necessary to reduce the refinancing amounts to acceptable loan to value levels required for this type of financing in the current capital markets environment 
currently  the expected partner capital requirements for maturing debt in our joint ventures is estimated to be in a range of of the loan balances at maturity based upon prevailing market terms at the time of refinancing 
we would fund our pro rata share of a capital call  if any  from our unsecured credit facilities 
we believe that our partners have sufficient capital or access thereto for these future capital 
table of contents 
index to financial statements requirements  however  we can provide no assurance that the current economic crisis will not inhibit their ability to access capital and meet their future funding requirements 
a more detailed loan maturity schedule is included below under notes payable 
we would expect that maturing unsecured public debt would be repaid from the proceeds of similar new unsecured issues in the future if those capital markets are available  although in the current environment  new issues are significantly more expensive than historical issues 
to the extent that issuing unsecured debt in the public markets is cost prohibitive or unavailable  we believe that we have sufficient unsecured assets that we could finance with secured mortgages and repay the unsecured public debt 
we have million and million of public debt maturing in and  respectively 
the joint ventures are not rated and therefore do not issue and have no unsecured public debt outstanding 
although common or preferred equity raised in the public markets is a funding option  given the state of the current capital markets  our access to these markets may be limited 
when the conditions for the issuance of equity are more favorable  we might consider issuing equity to fund new investment opportunities  fund our development program or repay maturing debt  which would result in dilution to our existing shareholders 
we would also consider issuing equity as part of a financing plan to maintain our leverage ratios at acceptable levels as determined by our board of directors

index to financial statements statement 
on march   we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps totaling million with fixed rates of    and 
we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the rate on million of new financing expected to occur in and  and these proceeds will be used to repay maturing debt at that time 
the change in fair value of these swaps from inception was a liability of million at december  the valuation of these derivative instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves  foreign exchange rates  and implied volatilities 
to comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements statement as amended by fasb staff position effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp fas  we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within level of the fair value hierarchy  the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize level inputs  such as estimates of current credit spreads  to evaluate the likelihood of default by ourselves and our counterparties 
equity transactions from time to time  we issue equity in the form of exchangeable operating partnership units or preferred units of rclp  or in the form of common or preferred stock of regency centers corporation as follows preferred units we have issued preferred units through rclp in various amounts since  the net proceeds of which were used to reduce the balance of the line 
we issue preferred units primarily to institutional investors in private placements 
generally  the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock after a specified date at an exchange rate of one share for one unit 
the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into our common stock 
at december  and  only the series d preferred units were outstanding with a face value of million and a fixed distribution rate of 
these units may be called by us beginning september   and have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption 
included in the series d preferred units are original issuance costs of  that will be expensed if they are redeemed in the future 
as of december  and  we had  and  redeemable operating partnership units op units outstanding  respectively 
the redemption value of the redeemable op units is based on the closing market price of regency s common stock  which was per share as of december  and per share as of december   aggregated million and million  respectively 
preferred stock the series   and preferred shares are perpetual  are not convertible into our common stock  and are redeemable at par upon our election beginning five years after the issuance date 
none of the terms of the preferred stock contain any unconditional obligations that would require us to redeem the securities at any time or for any purpose 
terms and conditions of the three series of preferred stock outstanding as of december  are summarized as follows

index to financial statements series shares outstanding liquidation preference distribution rate callable by company series series series on january   we split each share of existing series and series preferred stock  each having a liquidation preference of per share and a redemption price of per share into ten shares of series and series stock  respectively  each having a liquidation preference and a redemption price of per share 
we then exchanged each series and depositary share into shares of new series and stock  respectively  which have the same dividend rights and other rights and preferences identical to the depositary shares 
common stock at december    common shares had been issued 
the carrying value of the common stock was  with a par value of critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results  and discussion and analysis of these results 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon  but not limited to  our judgments about historical results  current economic activity  and industry accounting standards 
they are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness  however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
revenue recognition and tenant receivables tenant receivables represent revenues recognized in our financial statements  and include base rent  percentage rent  and expense recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes 
we analyze tenant receivables  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we analyze the accounts of tenants in bankruptcy  and we estimate the recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
our reported net income is directly affected by our estimate of the recoverability of tenant receivables 
recognition of gains from the sales of real estate we account for profit recognition on sales of real estate in accordance with statement in summary  profits from sales of real estate are not recognized under the full accrual method by us unless a sale is consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  a receivable  if applicable  is not subject to future subordination  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have substantial continuing involvement with the property 
we sell shopping center properties to joint ventures in exchange for cash equal to the fair value of the percentage interest owned by our partners 
we have accounted for those sales as partial sales and recognized gains on those partial sales in the period the properties were sold to the extent of the percentage interest sold under the guidance of statement  and in the case of certain partnerships  we apply a more restrictive method of recognizing gains  as discussed further below 
the gains and operations are not recorded as discontinued operations because we continue to manage these shopping centers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements five of our joint ventures dik jv give either partner the unilateral right to elect to dissolve the partnership and  upon such an election  receive a distribution in kind dik of the assets of the partnership equal to their respective ownership interests 
the liquidation procedures would require that all of the properties owned by the partnership be appraised to determine their respective and collective fair values 
as a general rule  if we initiate the liquidation process  our partner has the right to choose the first property that it will receive in liquidation with the company having the right to choose the next property that it will receive in liquidation  if our partner initiates the liquidation process  the order of the selection process is reversed 
the process then continues with alternating selection of properties by each partner until the balance of each partner s capital account on a fair value basis has been distributed 
after the final selection  to the extent that the fair value of properties in the dik jv are not distributable in a manner that equals the balance of each partner s capital account  a cash payment would be made by the partner receiving a fair value in excess of its capital account to the other partner 
the partners may also elect to liquidate some or all of the properties through sales rather than through the dik process 
we have concluded that these dik dissolution provisions constitute in substance call put options under the guidance of statement  and represent a form of continuing involvement with respect to property that we sold to these partnerships  limiting our recognition of gain related to the partial sale 
to the extent that the dik jv owns more than one property and we are unable to obtain all of the properties we sold to the dik jv in liquidation  we apply a more restrictive method of gain recognition restricted gain method which considers our potential ability to receive property through a dik on which partial gain has been recognized  and ensures  as discussed below  maximum gain deferral upon sale to a dik jv 
we have applied the restricted gain method to partial sales of property to partnerships that contain such unilateral dik provisions 
under current guidance  statement  paragraph  profit shall be recognized by a method determined by the nature and extent of the seller s continuing involvement and the profit recognized shall be reduced by the maximum exposure to loss 
we have concluded that the restricted gain method accomplishes this objective 
under the restricted gain method  for purposes of gain deferral  we consider the aggregate pool of properties sold into the dik jv as well as the aggregate pool of properties which will be distributed in the dik process 
as a result  upon the sale of properties to a dik jv  we perform a hypothetical dik liquidation assuming that we would choose only those properties that we have sold to the dik jv in an amount equivalent to our capital account 
for purposes of calculating the gain to be deferred  the company assumes that it will select properties upon a dik liquidation that generated the highest gain to the company when originally sold to the dik jv and includes for such determination the fair value in properties that could be received in excess of its capital account 
the dik deferred gain is calculated whenever a property is sold to the dik jv by us 
during the years when there are no property sales  the dik deferred gain is not recalculated 
because the contingency associated with the possibility of receiving a particular property back upon liquidation  which forms the basis of the restricted gain method  is not satisfied at the property level  but at the aggregate level  no gain or loss is recognized on property sold by the dik jv to a third party or received by the company upon actual dissolution 
instead  the property received upon actual dissolution is recorded at the company s historical cost investment in the dik jv  reduced by the deferred gain 
capitalization of costs we capitalize the acquisition of land  the construction of buildings and other specifically identifiable development costs incurred by recording them into properties in development in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and account for them in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects statement and eitf  accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions eitf 
in summary  statement establishes that a rental project changes from non operating to operating when it is substantially completed and held available for occupancy 
at that time  costs should no longer be capitalized 
other development costs include pre development costs essential to the development of the property  as well as  interest  real estate taxes  and direct employee 
table of contents 
index to financial statements costs incurred during the development period 
pre development costs are incurred prior to land acquisition during the due diligence phase and include contract deposits  legal  engineering and other professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
at december  we had million of capitalized pre development costs of which million represented refundable contract deposits 
if we determine that the development of a specific project undergoing due diligence is no longer probable  we immediately expense all related capitalized pre development costs not considered recoverable 
during and  we expensed pre development costs of million and million  respectively  recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of the economic downturn primarily during the month of december  we evaluated our pre development costs and determined that certain projects were no longer likely to be executed  therefore  we expensed those costs resulting in significantly higher expensed amounts in than in in accordance with sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost statement  interest costs are capitalized into each development project based on applying our weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development costs expended 
we cease interest cost capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but in no event would we capitalize interest on the project beyond months after substantial completion of the building shell 
during we capitalized interest of million on our development projects 
we have a large staff of employees the investment group who support our development program 
all direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development project 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of direct costs incurred by the investment group 
the capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring 
as a result of the current economic downturn  development activity slowed during resulting in a reduction in capitalized costs which increased general and administrative expenses 
also  if accounting standards issued in the future were to limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses and a reduction in net income 
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations statement 
based on these estimates  we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets each reporting period and account for any changes in estimated useful lives over the revised remaining useful life 
valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used to determine whether impairment exists and if so  to what extent 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods to determine fair value of the asset 
if we determine that the carrying amount of a property is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we will write down the asset to fair value 
for properties to be held and used for long term investment we estimate undiscounted future cash flows over the expected investment term including the estimated future value of the asset upon sale at the end of the investment period 
future value is generally determined by applying a market based capitalization rate to the estimated future net operating income in the final year of the expected investment term 
if after applying this method a property is determined to be impaired  we determine the provision for impairment based upon applying a market capitalization rate to current estimated net operating income as if the sale were to occur immediately 
for properties held for sale  we estimate current resale values by market through appraisal information and other market data less expected costs to sell 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb  a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting  which is other than a temporary decline  must be recognized 
in the case of our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships  we calculate the present value of our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of investment 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  tenant credit quality  and demand for new retail stores 
the significant economic downturn that began during the fourth quarter of and the corresponding rise in capitalization rates caused us to evaluate our properties for impairment including our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
as a result of our analysis  we recorded an additional million provision for impairment during the three months ended december  in addition to the million recorded through september  in summary  during the year we recorded million related to eight shopping centers  million related to several land parcels  million related to our investment in two partnerships  and million related to a note receivable 
if capitalization rates continue to rise in the future  or if a property categorized as held and used were changed to held for sale  we could record additional impairments in subsequent periods 
discontinued operations the application of current accounting principles that govern the classification of any of our properties as held for sale on the balance sheet  or the presentation of results of operations and gains on the sale of these properties as discontinued  requires management to make certain significant judgments 
in evaluating whether a property meets the criteria set forth by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets statement  we make a determination as to the point in time whether it is probable that a sale will be consummated 
given the nature of real estate sales contracts  it is not unusual for such contracts to allow potential buyers a period of time to evaluate the property prior to formal acceptance of the contract 
in addition  certain other matters critical to the final sale  such as financing arrangements often remain pending even upon contract acceptance 
as a result  properties under contract may not close within the expected time period  or may not close at all 
therefore  any properties categorized as held for sale represent only those properties that management has determined are probable to close within the requirements set forth in statement in order to determine if the results of operations and gain on sale should be reflected as discontinued operations  prior to the sale  we evaluate the extent of involvement and significance of cash flows the sale will have with a property after the sale 
consistent with statement  any property sold in which we have significant continuing involvement or cash flows most often sales to co investment partnerships in which we continue to manage the property is not considered to be discontinued 
in addition  any property which we sell to an unrelated third party  but which we retain a property management function  is not considered discontinued 
therefore  based on our evaluation of statement and in accordance with eitf applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations eitf  only properties sold  or to be sold  to unrelated third parties  where we will have no significant continuing involvement or significant cash flows are classified as discontinued 
in accordance with eitf allocation of interest to discontinued operations eitf  its operations  including any mortgage interest and gain on sale  are reported in discontinued operations so that the operations are clearly distinguished 
prior periods are also reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
when we sell operating properties to our joint ventures or to third parties  and will have continuing involvement  the operations and gains on sales are included in income from continuing operations 
investments in real estate partnerships in addition to owning real estate directly  we invest in real estate through our co investment partnerships 
joint venturing provides us with a capital source to acquire real estate  and to earn our pro rata share of the net income or loss from the co investment partnerships in addition to fees for services 
as asset and property manager  we conduct the business of the unconsolidated properties held in the co investment partnerships in the same way that we conduct the business of the consolidated properties that are wholly owned  therefore  the critical accounting policies as described are also applicable to our investments in the co investment partnerships 
we account for all investments in which we do not have a controlling financial ownership interest using the equity method 
we have determined that these investments are not variable interest entities as defined in fin r and do not require consolidation under eitf or sop  and therefore  are subject to the voting interest model in determining our basis of accounting 
decisions  including property acquisitions and dispositions  financings  certain leasing arrangements  annual budgets and dissolution of the ventures are subject to the approval of all partners  or in the case of the fund  its advisory committee

we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity  or operations  however  we can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  that any previous owner  occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by unrelated third parties  or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us 
inflation inflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  more recent data suggests inflation has been increasing and may become a greater concern in the current economy 
substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk 
our line has a variable interest rate that is based upon libor plus a spread of basis points and the term loan within our term facility has a variable interest rate based upon libor plus a spread of basis points 
libor rates charged on our unsecured credit facilities change monthly 
based upon the current balance of our unsecured credit facilities  a increase in libor would equate to an additional million of interest costs per year 
the spread on the unsecured credit facilities is dependent upon maintaining specific credit ratings 
if our credit ratings were downgraded  the spread on the unsecured credit facilities would increase  resulting in higher interest costs 
we are also exposed to higher interest rates when we refinance our existing long term fixed rate debt 
the objective of our interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed interest rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  or treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have million of fixed rate debt maturing in and that have a weighted average fixed interest rate of  which includes million of unsecured long term debt 
during we entered into four forward starting interest rate swaps the swaps totaling million with fixed rates of    and 
we designated these swaps as cash flow hedges to fix the future interest rates on million of the financing expected to occur in and as a result of a decline in year treasury interest rates since the inception of the swaps  the fair value of the swaps as of december  is reflected as a liability of million in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
it remains highly probable that the forecasted transactions will occur as projected at the inception of the swaps and therefore  the change in fair value of the swaps is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that future year treasury rates at the future settlement dates are higher than current rates  this liability will decline 
if a liability exists at the dates the swaps are settled  the liability will be amortized over the term of the respective debt issuances as additional interest expense in addition to the stated interest rates on the new issuances 
in the case of million of the swaps  we continue to expect to issue new secured or unsecured debt for a term of to years during the period between june  and june  in the case of million of the swaps  we continue to expect to issue new debt for a term of to years during the period between march  and march  we continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt to repay maturing debt or fund our commitments 
based upon the current capital markets  our current credit ratings  and the number of high quality  unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings  we expect that we will successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund our obligations 
however  in the current environment  we expect interest rates on new issuances to be significantly higher than on historical issuances 
an increase of in the interest rate of new debt issues above that of maturing debt would result in additional annual interest expense of million in addition to the impact of the annual amortization that would be incurred as a result of settling the swaps 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands as of december   by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table  those rates represent rates that existed at december  and are subject to change on a monthly basis 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
since firm commitments are not presented  the table has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with

the fair value of total debt in the table above is billion versus the face value of billion  which suggests that as new debt is issued in the future to repay maturing debt  the cost of new debt issuances will be higher than the current cost of existing debt
