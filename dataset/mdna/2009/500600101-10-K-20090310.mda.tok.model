item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks discussed in item a 
risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method  bad debts  inventories  warranty reserves  investment valuations  valuation of stock compensation awards  recoverability of deferred tax assets  liabilities for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize revenue for products prior to customer acceptance unless we believe the product meets all customer specifications and has a history of consistently achieving customer acceptance of the product 
provisions for product returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenues 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of product when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances 
certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products 
sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors customers and not for stocking of inventory 
we delay revenue recognition for our estimate of distributor claims of right of return on unsold products based upon our historical experience with our products and specific analysis of amounts subject to return based upon discussions with our distributors or their customers 
we recognize revenues from long term research and development contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount funded by the us government or contracting entity 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
in some instances  we are contracted to create a deliverable which is anticipated to be qualified and go into full rate production stages 
in those cases  the revenue recognition methodology will change from the percentage of completion method to the units of delivery method as new contracts are received after formal qualification has been completed 
in certain instances qualification may be achieved and delivery of production units may commence however our customer may have either identified new issues to be resolved or wish to incorporate a newer display technology 
in these circumstances new units delivered will continue to be accounted for under the units of delivery method 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as billings in excess of revenues earned 
we invoice based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability and cost of materials  and performance by our subcontractors 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
if our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make future payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans 
inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved representing the estimated net realizable value as such information becomes available 
our iii v products are made to each customer s unique specifications and are generally produced upon receipt of a customer order 
the manufacturing time to make our iii v products is less than one day  accordingly our iii v inventory consists primarily of raw material  primarily gallium arsenide wafers  or finished products 
the finished product may be at our facilities or at our customer s facilities under consignment programs 
our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non binding demand forecasts provided by our customers  lead times for raw materials  lead times for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields 
if a customer were to cancel an order or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand  we could not sell the excess iii v inventory and we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required 
if we were unable to sell the excess inventory  we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value generally zero 
investment valuation we hold a minority investment in micrel incorporated  a publicly traded company whose share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
we consider this investment to be available for sale and accordingly account for fluctuations in the value of this investment in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if  however  we were to determine that the fair value of this investment had been other than temporarily impaired  we would be required to charge the loss directly to the statement of operations 
this investment had a fair market value of million at december   which was less than our carrying value at that date  and accordingly we recorded a million charge to our statement of operations to reduce the investment to its fair value 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an additional impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically make equity investments in private companies  accounted for on the cost or equity method  whose values are difficult to determine 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the amortization or depreciation period may need to be changed 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such asset are less than its carrying value 
for assets that are to be held and used  impairment is measured based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
if our estimates of anticipated future cash flows or market conditions were incorrect  additional impairment charges may be required 
we did not incur any long lived asset impairment charges in  or product warranty we generally sell products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products 
we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we had a warranty reserve of million  which represents the estimated liabilities for warranty claims in process  potential warranty issues customers have notified us about and an estimate based on historical failure rates 
for the fiscal years  and  our warranty expense was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if our estimates for warranty claims are incorrect  our profits would be negatively impacted 
income taxes we have historically incurred domestic operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint 
we establish valuation allowances if it appears more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these judgments are based on our projections of taxable income and the amount and timing of our tax operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
given our federal operating tax loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay domestic federal taxes in the near term 
it is possible that we could pay domestic alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
we are also subject to foreign taxes from our korean subsidiary operations 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities 
despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes  federal alternative minimum taxes or foreign tax that may be due 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we also establish valuation allowances when recovery of such net deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than not 
these judgments consider our historical results and forecasts of future results 
because of our history of operating losses  our net operating loss carryforwards have had a full valuation allowance associated with them 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin 
fin addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
stock compensation we estimate the fair value of each stock based award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
the black scholes merton option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility  the expected life of options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
many of these assumptions are highly subjective and require the exercise of management judgment 
our management must also apply judgment in developing an estimate of awards that may be forfeited 
if our actual experience differs significantly from our estimates and we choose to employ different assumptions in the future  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
such options vest over  in general  a four year period 
we did not issue any new stock option awards during  or  rather we elected to make awards of restricted shares 
these awards are generally valued at the value of the underlying shares on the date they are granted and require us only to estimate forfeiture rates 
results of operations we are a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and miniature displays 
we use our proprietary semiconductor material technology to design  manufacture and market our iii v and cyberdisplay products for use in highly demanding commercial wireless communications and high resolution portable consumer electronic applications 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
we have two principal sources of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
product revenues consist of sales of our iii v products  principally gallium arsenide gaas hbt transistor wafers  and cyberdisplay products 
research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies or prime contractors of the us government 
research and development revenues were million  or of revenues  million  or of total revenues and million  or of total revenues in kowon  our korean subsidiary and one of our reportable segments  provides to us back end packaging services related to our cyberdisplay products as well as selling displays to other customers 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and  were as follows in millions revenues iii v cyberdisplay total the increase in our iii v revenues resulted from a net increase in unit demand for our hbt transistor wafers from customers that use them in wireless handset applications  which was partially off set by price declines of our hbt products 
the increase in display revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products to customers that use them for military applications 
display revenues for consumer and military applications for and were as follows cyberdisplay revenues by category in millions military applications consumer electronic applications eyewear applications research development total revenues of our korean subsidiary  kowon  are included in cyberdisplay revenues and sales are primarily to us and samsung electronics for camcorder applications 
kowon s revenues decreased as a result of lower demand from us due to lower sales of displays to customers that use them for digital still camera applications and a decline in demand from samsung for displays for camcorder applications 
cyberdisplay revenues by segment were as follows for and cyberdisplay revenues by segment in millions kopin us revenues kowon revenues to other customers kowon revenues kowon sales to kopin total cyberdisplay revenues we have been reducing our emphasis on sales of our display products for digital still camera and camcorder applications because of the low gross profit margins from these sales  and  as a result  in addition to the impact on sales of consumer electronic products from the global economic downturn  we expect sales of our cyberdisplay products for digital still camera and camcorder applications to decline significantly in we also anticipate  based on current discussions with our customers and certain contractual obligations  that the prices of certain of our products to decline in fiscal year we anticipate the average selling price of our hbt transistor wafers and display products sold to customers for consumer electronics applications will decline approximately during fiscal year relative to we expect sales prices of our display products for military applications to remain the same for as compared to the overall increase or decrease in the average sales price of our display products will be dependent on the sales mix of commercial and military display sales 
for we anticipate sales of display products for military applications to increase and sales of our iii v products for wireless handset applications and our display products for consumer electronic applications to decline 
however  as a result of the historic declines in the united stated and global economies  our ability to forecast is very limited 
this forecast is based on our discussions with customers and our expectations about the future global economy and is not based on firm non cancellable orders 
we currently manufacture and sell hbt wafers on either four or six inch gallium arsenide gaas wafers 
our largest customer  who accounted for approximately of our total revenues see item a  risk factors for explanation of percent of revenue calculation  purchases our hbt products on four inch gaas wafers and we expect this customer to migrate to using six inch gaas wafers in its manufacturing process in if we are unable to get reactors qualified by our largest and other customers or if we are able to get the reactors qualified but can not manufacture the quantity our customers require or can not manufacture on six inch gaas wafers in a cost effective manner  our revenues and results of operations could decline significantly 
international sales represented and of product revenues for fiscal years and respectively 
the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products for us military applications and a decline in sales of our display products for digital still camera and camcorder applications to asian customers 
we expect this trend to continue in international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan  korea and china 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary  kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon s sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon s local operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
kowon also holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the historically stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenue in millions cost of product revenue as a of revenues cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  decreased approximately million or from to our gross margin is affected by increases or decrease in the sales prices of our products  changes in raw material prices  unit volume of sales  manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold 
as discussed above our sales prices historically decline on an annual basis 
our overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  our labor costs are normally stable and do not fluctuate significantly during a three or twelve month period 
essentially  we consider labor and overhead costs to be fixed in nature over the short term and therefore profitability is very dependent on our sales prices of the products and volume of sales 
gross margins increased in  as compared to  because of an increase in sales of our display products for military applications  which have higher margins  and a decline in sales of display products for consumer electronic applications which have low margins 
offsetting these increases in gross margins was a decline in the average unit selling prices of our iii v products as compared to for we anticipate sales of display products for military applications to increase and sales of our iii v products for wireless handset applications and our displays products for consumer electronic applications to decline 
as a result we expect cost of sales as a percentage of sales to decrease 
however this expectation is based on assumptions about the duration of the current economic down turn from discussions with customers and not as a result of firm non cancellable purchase orders 
there are a number of different display technologies which can produce displays in small form factors 
we believe one of the benefits of our display technology is the ability to produce high resolution displays in small form factors 
the camcorder and digital still camera markets are mature and the majority of these devices use low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors and therefore the ability to sell displays into these markets is very price dependent 
accordingly for us to generate display revenues with above average gross margins  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories  such as eyewear 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the us government and commercial partners 
r d revenues associated with funded programs are presented separately in revenue in the statement of operations 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
for fiscal years and r d expense was as follows in millions research and development expense funded internal total r d expense increased in as compared to the prior year primarily because of an increase in funded programs from agencies and prime contractors of the us government 
the increase in internal research and development expenses was primarily attributed to costs to develop our inch display and mocvd iii v manufacturing lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense in millions selling  general and administrative expense as a of revenues the decrease in s  g a expenses in versus is attributable to a decrease of approximately million for professional fees associated with the stock option practice investigation and the restatement of our historical financial statements  million associated with reduced marketing at our korean subsidiary and million of information technology expense  which were partially offset by a million increase in allowances for accounts receivable and other professional fees of million 
included in s  g a is approximately  for professional fees for the preparation of our tender offer to purchase  stock options from employees 
had we not purchased these stock options  they may have resulted in excise taxes for the employees and reporting requirements for us under section a of the internal revenue code 
we agreed to pay approximately  for these stock options which represented the fair market value of the options as determined through the use of the black scholes merton option pricing model 
in december  the compensation committee of the company approved the issuance of  restricted stock awards to certain of our employees 
an employee can earn awards if the employee remains with the company for the fiscal year and the product line the employee works with achieves certain performance conditions in fiscal year in december the compensation committee approved the issuance of  restricted stock awards to employees subject to certain conditions 
these conditions  which primarily consisted of the company meeting its listing requirements of the nasdaq stock exchange  were fulfilled in april and the restricted stock awards were granted in april in addition  as part of its board of director compensation in fiscal year we issued  shares of restricted stock to our board members representing the annual grants for fiscal years and of the  awards  employees could earn  shares of the awards based on remaining with the company for fiscal year and the product line the employee worked with achieved certain performance conditions in the performance period 
the remaining  restricted stock awards to employees and board of directors requires them to fulfill certain obligations including continued employment with us or remaining on our board of directors for periods of either two or four years the restriction period to earn their portion of the award 
in connection with the issuance of the awards above  and the amortization of awards issued before fiscal year  we recorded stock compensation expenses of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
other income and expense 
other income and expense in millions other income and expense in includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of foreign exchange gains  a loss of million on the sale of our kenet investment  a million charge for the write off of certain loans to ktc  million for other than temporary impairment charges for corporate debt instruments  and million for the other than temporary impairment charge on our investment in micrel 
we are evaluating our strategic relationship with ktc and may make future loans to support ktc 
other income and expense for includes interest and miscellaneous income of million  million of foreign exchange gains  million for an other than temporary impairment of our investment in micrel  and of miscellaneous bank fees and other expense 
during ktc has been incurring operating losses and  as a result  it has been experiencing cash flow problems 
ktc is currently restructuring its operations  which includes plans to exit unprofitable product lines and lower overhead costs 
on october  we entered into an agreement wherein we loaned ktc million for first and third liens on its building and certain equipment 
for financial accounting reporting purposes million of the million was considered an equity investment and is included in equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates 
at december  we reviewed the collectability of the loan to ktc and recorded a loan loss reserve of million based on ktc s projected cash flows 
we are under no obligation to make future loans to ktc  however we are reviewing its strategic importance to us and may make additional loans 
we have investments totaling million in corporate debt instruments 
million of these are floating rate notes whose maturity is over multiple years but whose interest rate is reset every three months based on then current three month london interbank offering rate month libor 
we determine the fair market values of these corporate debt instruments through the use of a model which incorporates the month libor and the credit default swap rate of the issuer 
after the fair market value of these corporate debt instruments is computed under this method we review whether our valuation falls within the bid and ask price spread of the same or similar investments which are traded on several markets 
we do not use these bid and ask prices as the sole input in valuing the instruments because the spreads between the bid and ask prices have been increasing  which indicate that they may not reflect an accurate measure of fair market value 
the other than temporary impairment of million discussed above represents the difference between the acquisition cost of the investments and our computation of their fair market value for all corporate debt instruments whose acquisition cost has exceeded their computed fair market value for months or for which other indicators of impairment exist 
minority interest in income loss of subsidiary 
we own approximately of the equity of kowon technology co 
ltd 
kowon 
minority interest on the consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of kowon which is allocated to the shareholders of the approximately of kowon not owned by us 
the change in the minority interest in income loss of subsidiary is the result of the change in the results of operations of kowon 
the results of operations of kowon were essentially the same in and equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates consists of our approximate share of the losses of kobrite totaling million in and million in and our approximate share in the losses of ktc totaling million in tax provision benefit 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended and represent alternative minimum taxes owed to us federal and state taxing authorities of million and million  respectively  and foreign taxes on the income of our subsidiary kowon of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year the company significantly reduced its available state net operating loss carryforwards and credits and accordingly expects to have a state tax liability for tax reporting purposes which may results in an increased state tax provision for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and  were as follows in millions revenues iii v cyberdisplay total the decrease in our iii v revenues resulted from a net increase in unit demand for our hbt transistor wafers from customers that use them in wireless handset applications  which was partially off set by price declines of our hbt products and a decline in our cyberlite revenues  which were million for the year ended our cyberlite revenues declined because we sold the product line to the kobrite joint venture in the increase in display revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted from an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products to customers that use them for digital still camera applications and military applications 
display revenues for consumer and military applications for and were as follows in millions cyberdisplay revenues by category consumer electronic applications military application eyewear application research development total revenues of our korean subsidiary  kowon  are included in cyberdisplay revenues and sales are primarily to us and samsung electronics for camcorder applications 
kowon s revenues increased as a result of demand from us to support our increased sales of displays to customers that use them for digital still camera applications 
cyberdisplay revenues by segment were as follows for and in millions cyberdisplay revenues by segment kopin us revenues kowon revenues to other customers kowon revenues kowon sales to kopin total cyberdisplay revenues international sales represented and of product revenues for fiscal years and respectively 
the increase in international sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of our cyberdisplay products for digital still camera applications to asian customers 
international sales are primarily sales of cyberdisplay products to consumer electronic manufacturers primarily located in japan  korea and china 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenue in millions cost of product revenue as a of revenues cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  increased approximately million or from to our gross margin is affected by sales price declines of our products  changes in raw material prices  unit volume of sales  manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold 
as discussed above our sales prices historically decline on an annual basis 
our strategy to offset the impact of the sales price declines has been to increase the unit volume of sales  improve manufacturing efficiencies and increase the sales of products which have higher margins  specifically military products 
our overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  our labor costs are normally stable and do not fluctuate significantly during a three or twelve month period 
essentially  we consider labor and overhead costs to be fixed in nature over the short term and therefore profitability is based on the amount of variable margin we can generate to cover these fixed costs 
variable margin is the product of the number of units sold and the difference between a units selling price and its material cost 
gross margins declined in  as compared to  because of a decline in the average unit selling prices of our iii v and display products as compared to and the impact of an increase in displays sold for digital still camera applications which are sold at a price which generates a small or negative variable margin 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses are incurred in support of internal display and iii v product development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government and commercial partners 
r d revenues associated with funded programs are presented separately in revenue in the statement of operations 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
for fiscal years and r d expense was as follows in millions research and development expense funded internal total funded r d expense decreased in as compared to the prior year primarily because of a decrease in funded programs from the us military 
the increase in internal research and development expenses was primarily attributed to cost to develop our inch display and mocvd iii v manufacturing lines

selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense in millions selling  general and administrative expense as a of revenues the decrease in s  g a expenses in versus is attributable to a decrease of approximately million for professional fees associated with the stock option practice investigation and the restatement of our historical financial statements partially offset by increases in allowances for accounts receivable of million 
total professional fees for the stock option review were million and million in and  respectively 
in fiscal year  we issued  restricted stock awards to certain of our employees 
each award requires the employee to fulfill certain obligations including continued employment with us for periods of either two or four years the restriction period 
in connection with the issuance of these and prior awards  we recorded stock based compensation expenses of million and million in and  respectively

the provision for income taxes for fiscal year represents alternative minimum taxes owed to us federal and state taxing authorities of million and foreign taxes on the income of our subsidiary kowon of million 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal year represents the reversal of tax contingencies due to the expiration of the statute of limitations of million  a tax benefit from a loss carryback of million offset by alternative minimum taxes of million and the provision of a valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and equivalents and marketable debt securities of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the increase in cash and equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of million which was partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
in april  we amended a purchase and supply agreement with a significant hbt customer that now expires in july  excluding a last time buy option contained in the agreement 
under the terms of this agreement we have agreed to maintain capacity levels for manufacturing hbt wafers and we committed to a pricing schedule under certain circumstances 
the agreement also requires us to give prior notice if we exit our hbt product line 
in consideration for this agreement the customer agreed to source and of its four and six inch hbt wafer needs  respectively  from us subject to the customer s right to source hbt wafers from other sources if we are unable to meet their requirements under certain circumstances 
we agreed that failure to meet our supply obligations under the agreement would allow our customer to obtain court ordered specific performance and if we do not perform we could then be liable for monetary damages up to a maximum of million 
we lease facilities located in taunton and westborough  massachusetts  and scotts valley  california  under non cancelable operating leases 
we have two taunton facilities  one whose lease expires in and the other in the taunton lease expires in and may be extended twice for individual year terms 
the westborough and scotts valley leases expire in we expect to expend between and million on capital expenditures over the next twelve months  primarily for the acquisition of equipment to increase capacity in our iii v product line and implement the production line for our cyberdisplay products 
as of december   we had substantial tax loss carry forwards  which may be used to offset future federal taxable income 
we may be subject to alternative minimum taxes  foreign taxes and state income taxes depending on our taxable income and sources of taxable income 
we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our equity securities 
we believe our available cash resources will support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   as required for its financial assets and financial liabilities 
however  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas for one year as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
the adoption of sfas for our financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements see note
