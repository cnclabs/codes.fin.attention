for example  certain of the market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about essential model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  actual income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the forward looking statements contained in this document include  but are not limited to adverse changes in our loan and lease portfolios and the resulting credit risk related losses and expenses  
table of contents adverse changes in the automobile industry  interest rate fluctuations which could increase our cost of funds or decrease our yield on earning assets and therefore reduce our net interest income  continued levels of our loan and lease quality and origination volume  the adequacy of loss reserves  the loss of certain key officers  which could adversely impact our business  continued relationships with major customers  the ability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of bank and non bank entities while controlling our costs  adverse national and regional economic and business conditions  compliance with laws and regulatory requirements of federal and state agencies  competition from other financial institutions in originating loans  attracting deposits  and providing various financial services that may affect our profitability  the ability to hedge certain risks economically  our ability to effectively implement technology driven products and services  greater reliance on wholesale funding because our loan growth has outpaced our deposit growth  and we have no current access the securitization markets  the pace of our loan growth compared to our deposit growth  changes in consumer confidence  spending and savings habits relative to the bank and non bank financial services we provide  and our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing

the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of susquehanna s financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document

critical accounting estimates susquehanna s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates that we used are based 
table of contents on historical experiences and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and estimates that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our most critical accounting estimates are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we believe that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets  the valuation of goodwill  and the determination of the fair value of certain financial instruments under the guidance of fas no 
 fair value measurements  and fsp no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses 
valuations for our investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  investment valuation is based on pricing models  quotes for similar investment securities  and observable yield curves and spreads 
in addition to valuation  management must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of the investments that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income 
for additional information on management s consideration of investment valuation and other then temporary impairment  refer to note investment securities and note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii  item recorded interests in securitized assets are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including estimates of repayment rates  credit loss experience  and discount rates that consider the risk involved 
since the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in estimates  the valuation of recorded interests in securitized assets is considered a critical accounting estimate 
note and note provide additional information regarding recorded interests 
management evaluates the valuation of goodwill on an annual basis and more often if situations or the economic environment warrant it 
in performing these evaluations  managements makes critical estimates to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
such estimates include assumptions used in determining cash flows and evaluation of appropriate market multiples 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement dates 
observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity 
unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
as defined in fas no 
 fair value measurements  level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the 
table of contents asset or liability 
for additional information about our financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value  refer to note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii
