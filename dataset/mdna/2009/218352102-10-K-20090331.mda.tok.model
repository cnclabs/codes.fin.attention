item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations results of operations 
medical education and commercialization we are planning for the commercialization of corlux 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop a marketing and sales force or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our products 
we intend to develop our own medical education and commercialization infrastructure in the united states for corlux because we believe that the initial markets for psychotic depression in the united states and for cushing s syndrome are highly concentrated and accessible 
we anticipate that this will include hiring a small  experienced field sales force to access patients with psychotic depression 
we intend to focus initially on patients who are candidates for ect by marketing to hospitals and psychiatrists that perform ect 
we estimate that there are approximately hospitals with more than in patient psychiatric beds 
of these  we estimate that approximately offer ect 
we believe that approximately psychiatrists administer most ect procedures 
subsequently  we also intend to expand our commercialization efforts to address the larger set of patients with psychotic depression currently undergoing combination drug therapy  which would require an increase in the size of our initial sales force 

table of contents we believe that a significant opportunity exists to further expand the market for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression beyond patients currently treated by ect and combination drug therapy 
a large portion of the people who suffer from psychotic depression remain unrecognized and undertreated 
we intend to develop medical educational programs to alert the medical community about early diagnosis of psychotic depression and increase awareness regarding corlux 
we also expect to hire a small  experienced field sales force to sell corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
we intend to focus on patients who are in the care of an endocrinologist and in active treatment for their disease 
we estimate that there are approximately endocrinologists who could be targeted to reach the cushing s syndrome patients in active treatment 
manufacturing as a drug development entity  we intend to continue to utilize our financial resources to complete the development of corlux and advance other product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing our own manufacturing facilities 
we intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates 
we have entered into manufacturing agreements with two contract manufacturers  produits chimiques auxiliaires et de synthese sa pcas and scinopharm taiwan scinopharm  to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  for corlux 
the agreement with pcas is for an initial period of five years with an automatic extension for one additional year unless either party gives twelve month s prior notice that it does not want the extension 
there is no guaranteed minimum purchase commitment under this agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement 
the agreement with scinopharm obligates us to purchase at least  of bulk mifepristone per year following the commercial launch of corlux 
this agreement is terminable by either party at any time 
we have also entered into an agreement with another contract manufacturer  pharmaform  llc  for the production of corlux tablets for use in clinical activities 
to date  our need for corlux tablets has been limited to the amounts required to support our clinical trials 
competition if approved for commercial use as a treatment for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  corlux will compete with established treatments  including ect and combination drug therapy 
ect has been shown to be the most effective treatment for psychotic depression  but it carries the risks of general anesthesia  potential memory loss and other adverse effects as well as the stigma associated with the procedure 
use of corlux does not require anesthesia and  in our clinical trials conducted to date  patients treated with corlux have not exhibited the adverse effects associated with ect 
other competitors include companies that market antipsychotic drugs that are used off label as part of combination drug therapy for psychotic depression 
to reduce the psychotic features of psychotic depression  these drugs generally are taken in combination with antidepressant medication over a period of weeks to several months 
unlike the use of corlux  this extended course of treatment may put patients at risk of significant adverse side effects  including weight gain  diabetes  sedation  permanent movement disorders and sexual dysfunction 
antipsychotics include bristol myers squibb s abilify  novartis clozaril  pfizer s geodon and navane  ortho mcneil s haldol  janssen pharmaceutica s risperdal  astrazeneca s seroquel  glaxosmithkline s stelazine and thorazine  mylan s mellaril  schering corporation s trilafon and eli lilly s zyprexa 
we are aware of one clinical trial that has taken place  conducted by the pharmaceutical division of akzo nobel  for a new chemical entity for the treatment of psychotic depression 
this new medicine is a gr ii antagonist  the commercial use of which would be covered by our patent 
in  akzo nobel filed an 
table of contents observation in our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression  in which akzo nobel challenged the claims of that patent application 
in  we filed a rebuttal to akzo nobel s observation 
in february  the european patent office  or epo  allowed our patent application 
in july  the patent was issued 
we are not aware of any public disclosures by any company  other than akzo nobel  regarding the development of new medicinal products to treat psychotic depression 
however  other companies may be developing new drug products to treat psychotic depression and the other conditions we are exploring 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  as well as specialized pharmaceutical firms 
most of our competitors have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made 
we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has received an orphan drug designation in the united states and europe for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a clinical trial in europe and the united states 
if this product is approved for commercialization before corlux  our potential future revenue could be reduced if there is off label use of mifepristone for psychotic depression or for cushing s syndrome that cannot be protected by our intellectual property 
many colleges  universities and public and private research organizations are also active in the human health care field 
while these entities focus on education  they may develop or acquire proprietary technology that we may require for the development of our product candidates 
we may attempt to obtain licenses to this proprietary technology 
our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to develop proprietary products  attract and retain scientific personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our product candidates  obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our future products either alone or through outside parties 
intellectual property patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions  and to rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
under an agreement with stanford university  we have licensed exclusive rights to the following issued us patents and any corresponding foreign patents us patent number subject matter expiration date us pat 
no 
 use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression october  us pat 
no 
 use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of cocaine induced psychosis october  us pat 
no 
 use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of early dementia february  we are required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to stanford university on sales of products commercialized under any of the above patents 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under the agreement 
if stanford university were to terminate any of our exclusive licenses due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 

table of contents we also own issued us patents for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment  for the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication  for the prevention and treatment of stress disorders  for the treatment of delirium  for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease  for inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with down s syndrome and for increasing the therapeutic response to ect 
in addition  we have three us composition of matter patent applications covering specific gr ii antagonists and six us method of use patent applications covering certain gr ii antagonists  including the treatment of catatonia  neurological damage in premature infants  migraine headaches  postpartum psychosis  and psychosis associated with interferon alpha therapy 
we have also filed  where we deemed appropriate  foreign patent applications corresponding to our us patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications or that competitors will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued 
although three of our patent applications have claims directed to the composition of compounds that are necessary to make our potential products  none of our issued patents have such claims 
specifically  we do not have a patent with claims directed to the composition of mifepristone 
our rights under our issued patents cover only the use of gr ii antagonists  including mifepristone  in the treatment of specific diseases 
the patent covering the product mifepristone has expired 
the only fda approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy 
the fda has imposed significant restrictions on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and may impose similar restrictions on corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we plan to rely on the scope of our use patent  the restrictions imposed by the fda on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and the different patient populations  administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat psychotic depression 
the patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain  involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation 
our product candidates may give rise to claims that we infringe on the products or proprietary rights of others 
if it is determined that our drug candidates infringe on others patent rights  we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights 
if we fail to obtain licenses when necessary  we may experience delays in commercializing our product candidates while attempting to design around other patents  or determine that we are unable to commercialize our product candidates at all 
if we do become involved in intellectual property litigation  we are likely to incur considerable costs in defending or prosecuting the litigation 
we believe that we do not currently infringe any third party s patents or other proprietary rights  and we are not obligated to pay royalties to any third party other than stanford university 
in november  mclean hospital had alleged that it also had rights to the technology that led to the patent for the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
mclean hospital was a prior employer of one of our founders  dr 
alan schatzberg and it alleged that the invention of the technology underlying this patent was conceived by dr 
schatzberg and or dr 
anthony rothschild while the two were employed by mclean hospital 
we contended that the invention was actually conceived by dr 
schatzberg and dr 
joseph belanoff while they were employed by stanford university and that the patent was appropriately 
table of contents assigned by them to stanford university 
in october  we announced a resolution of this issue in which we retained our exclusive rights under the patent and which required us to make no additional payments under the license  regardless of the resolution of the impending inventorship dispute 
in january  the inventorship issue was resolved in favor of stanford university 
as discussed above under competition  in akzo nobel filed an observation to the grant of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application 
we are not aware of any other disputes related to patent issues 
license agreement under our exclusive license agreement with stanford university to patents covering the use of corlux to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for the treatment of early dementia  we are required to pay stanford  annually as a nonrefundable royalty payment 
this payment is creditable against future royalties 
we are also obligated to pay stanford a  milestone upon the filing of the new drug application  or nda  for corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression and a further  milestone payment upon fda approval of corlux 
the milestone payments are also creditable against future royalties 
this license agreement expires upon expiration of the related patents or upon notification by us to stanford 
government regulation prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation  including regulations that govern the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  and promotion of the products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization 
the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing  submission of an ind  which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic s intended use  and  in the case of a new drug  approval by the fda of an nda 
the process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations in order to obtain the necessary approvals and subsequently complying with federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense 
preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product 
drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the fda as a part of an ind  which must be approved before beginning clinical trials in humans 
typically  human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
phase clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile  maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of the product candidate in human volunteers 
phase clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
phase large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the drug and to provide enough data to demonstrate with substantial evidence the efficacy and safety of the product  as required by the fda 
the fda and the institutional review boards closely monitor the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the united states and may reevaluate  alter  suspend or terminate the testing at any time for various reasons  including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda may also require that additional studies be conducted  such as studies demonstrating that the drug being tested does not cause cancer 

table of contents after phase trials are completed  drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies  clinical trials  formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the fda in the form of an nda for approval to commence commercial sales 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept an nda for filing 
if the fda accepts an nda for filing  they may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not meet regulatory approval criteria 
fda approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if the fda approves an nda  the subject drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the united states 
once approved  the fda may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre and post market regulatory standards is not maintained 
the drug developer must submit periodic reports to the fda 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removal 
product approvals may be withdrawn if problems with safety or efficacy occur after the product reaches the marketplace 
in addition  the fda may require post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies  to monitor the effect of approved products  and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post market studies 
facilities used to manufacture drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other authorities where applicable  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices regulations  or cgmp 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
with respect to post market product advertising and promotion  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals  which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from fda standards  a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda  and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions 
in addition to studies requested by the fda after approval  a drug developer may conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved compound for treatment of new indications 
the purpose of these trials and studies and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community 
data supporting the use of a drug for these new indications must be submitted to the fda in a new or supplemental nda that must be approved by the fda before the drug can be marketed for the new indications 
approvals outside the united states 
we have not started the regulatory approval process in any jurisdiction other than the united states and we are unable to estimate when  if ever  we will commence the regulatory approval process in any foreign jurisdiction 
we will have to complete an approval process similar to the us approval process in foreign target markets for our product candidates before we can commercialize our product candidates in those countries 
the approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional testing 
foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the united states 
the prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return to us 
fast track designation 
the fda sometimes grants fast track status under the food and drug administration modernization act of the fast track mechanism was created to facilitate the development and approval of new drugs intended for the treatment of life threatening conditions for which there are no effective treatments and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition 
the fast track process includes scheduling of meetings to seek fda input into development plans  the option of 
table of contents submitting an nda serially in sections rather than submitting all components simultaneously  the option to request evaluation of studies using surrogate endpoints  and the potential for a priority review 
we have been granted fast track status for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
however  the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda at any time 
the fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that corlux will receive regulatory approval 
priority review 
the fda has indicated to us that it will grant us a priority review of our nda of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression if no other medications have been approved for this indication at the time of our submission 
orphan drug designation 
the fda has granted us orphan drug designation for corlux for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome 
the designation provides special status to a product to treat a rare disease or condition providing that the product meets certain criteria 
orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the oda 
a marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition 
employees we are managed by a core group of experienced pharmaceutical executives with a track record of bringing new drugs to market 
to facilitate advancement of development programs  we also enlist the expertise of associates and advisors with extensive pharmaceutical development experience 
as of december   we had full time employees  three part time employees and long term contract staff 
four of our employees are mds we consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves significant risks 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this form k  including our financial statements and related notes  before you decide to invest in our common stock 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us  however  they may not be the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligations to update any risk factors 
risks related to our business we will depend heavily on the success of our lead product candidate  corlux  in development for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
our first three phase trials in psychotic depression did not meet their primary and key secondary endpoints 
if we are unable to commercialize corlux for the psychotic depression indication or for cushing s syndrome  or experience significant delays in doing so  we may be unable to generate revenues and our stock price may decline 
we have invested a significant portion of our time and financial resources since our inception in the development of corlux for the treatment of psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we currently do not have any commercial products and we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate meaningful revenues and achieve profitability will be solely dependent on the successful development  approval and commercialization of corlux for the treatment of psychotic features of psychotic depression or cushing s syndrome 
we have completed three phase clinical trials evaluating corlux for psychotic depression 
none of the first three trials met its primary or key secondary endpoints 
we are conducting a single phase trial in cushing s syndrome 
many factors could harm our efforts to develop and commercialize corlux  including insufficient funding  negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from our pre clinical or clinical development programs  side effects that may be identified in the course of our clinical trials  changes or delays in our clinical development program  rapid technological change making corlux obsolete  competition from companies with greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours  increases in the costs of our clinical trials  an inability to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approval for the commercialization of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  an inability to manufacture corlux or the active ingredient in corlux in commercial quantities and at an acceptable cost  and political concerns relating to other uses of mifepristone  or ru  that could limit the market acceptance of corlux 

table of contents our clinical trials may not demonstrate that corlux is safe and effective 
if our clinical program for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  for cushing s syndrome or for any other indications does not demonstrate safety and efficacy  our business will be harmed 
to gain regulatory approval from the fda to market corlux  our phase clinical trials must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of corlux for the particular indication 
our first three phase studies evaluating corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression did not meet their primary or key secondary endpoints 
in addition to the need for an additional phase clinical trial  we are conducting  or plan to conduct  other studies in support of a potential nda 
clinical development is a long  expensive and uncertain process and is subject to delays  and data obtained from clinical trials and supportive studies are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
while we obtained favorable results in our phase clinical trials in psychotic depression  these results were not replicated in a robust enough way in studies  or and are not sufficient to use by themselves as the pivotal clinical trials in an application for fda approval 
in addition  we cannot assure you that supportive studies and tests will produce favorable results 
the development plan for corlux is not certain  and will require additional  expensive clinical and preclinical trials 
we may not be able to finance the development programs 
during the development of corlux  we have been engaged in dialogue with the fda to determine an acceptable development plan which would enable the fda to complete its review in a satisfactory manner 
because the results of our previously completed phase trials evaluating corlux for treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression did not meet their primary endpoints  the fda is requiring us to pursue at least one additional clinical trial to demonstrate the safety and or efficacy of corlux for this indication 
the fda generally requires two positive phase studies or one positive phase study with other supportive data to be completed prior to the submission of an nda 
we anticipate continued dialogue with the fda to define any additional data needed to complete an nda 
further  we may decide  or the fda or other regulatory authorities may require us  to pursue additional clinical  pre clinical or manufacturing studies to satisfactorily complete our nda 
for example  the fda may require us to perform a bioequivalance study comparing our recently reformulated corlux clinical trial materials to the materials used in our earlier clinical trials 
additional trials or studies will require additional funding which is not assured 
also  it is possible that additional trials or studies that we decide are necessary or desirable will delay or prevent the completion of the development of corlux for treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression or cushing s syndrome 
we anticipate continued dialogue with the fda to define any additional data needed to complete an nda 
if adequate funds are not available for our currently contemplated trials and studies  or for any further ones that we may decide are necessary or desirable  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs 
even if funds are available  additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants  obtaining funds through collaborations may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  potentially including our lead product candidate  that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
even after we conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate for an optimal nda  we may not receive regulatory approval to market corlux 
many other factors could delay or result in termination of our clinical trials  including  but not limited to negative or inconclusive results  slow patient enrollment  patient noncompliance with the protocol  
table of contents adverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials  negative or problematic fda inspections of our clinical operations  and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of corlux 
even after we conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate for an optimal nda  we may not receive regulatory approval to market corlux 
we will need additional capital in order to complete the development and commercialization of corlux and our other proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
additional capital may not be available to us at all or on favorable terms 
we will have to perform additional clinical trials prior to submission of a new drug application  or nda  for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for cushing s syndrome 
we will need to raise additional funds to complete the development of corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression and cushing s syndrome 
in addition  we will need to raise additional funds to prepare for the commercialization of corlux for either of these indications  to develop a product for weight gain management associated with antipsychotic medications  and to continue and expand the development of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  including the availability of funding under the ceff  will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan into early however  our expectations are based on our currently planned clinical development and research programs for corlux and for certain of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists  which may change as a result of many factors  including the costs  timing of site selection and enrollment of our clinical trials  the results of our research efforts and clinical trials  the need to perform additional clinical trials and other supportive studies  the timing of the approval by the fda  if any  to market corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including announcements of claims of infringement  interference or litigation against us or our licensors  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in our growth rates  changes in our research development plans for our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonist  the timing of commercialization of corlux and future product candidates  and changes in the reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the recent market and economic conditions may make it significantly more difficult for us to raise new capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations 

table of contents the committed equity financing facility ceff that we entered into with kingsbridge on march  may not be available to us at certain times  may generate a lower level of funding than we anticipate  may require us to make additional blackout or other payments to kingsbridge  and will result in dilution to our stockholders 
kingsbridge will not be obligated to purchase shares under the ceff unless certain conditions are met  which include a minimum price for our common stock  currently set at per share  the accuracy of representations and warranties made to kingsbridge  compliance with laws  the effectiveness and continued effectiveness of the resale registration statement  and the continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq capital market 
on june   the sec declared effective our registration statement with the sec covering the resale of approximately million of the shares issuable under the ceff and the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant 
this registration statement covers approximately of the million shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff and all of the  shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
we intend to file additional registration statements covering the resale of additional shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the ceff beginning at the later of days after kingsbridge and its affiliates have resold substantially all of the securities registered for sale under this initial registration statement or six months after the effective date of this registration statement 
these subsequent registration statements are subject to our ability to prepare and file them and may be subject to review and comment by the staff of the sec  as well as consent by our independent registered accounting firm 
therefore  the timing of these subsequent registration statements becoming effective cannot be assured 
the effectiveness of these subsequent registration statements is a condition precedent to our ability to sell the shares of common stock subject to these subsequent registration statements to kingsbridge under the ceff 
we cannot assure you that these registration statements will be declared effective or  if declared effective  that they will remain continuously effective thereafter 
in addition  kingsbridge is permitted to terminate the ceff if it determines that a material and adverse event has occurred affecting our business  operations  properties or financial condition and if such condition continues for a period of days from the date kingsbridge provides us notice of such material and adverse event 
if we are unable to access funds through the ceff  or if the ceff is terminated by kingsbridge  we may be unable to access alternative capital on favorable terms or at all 
we are entitled in certain circumstances  to deliver a blackout notice to kingsbridge to suspend the use of the resale registration statement and prohibit kingsbridge from selling shares thereunder 
if we deliver a blackout notice in the trading days following the settlement of a draw down  or if the resale registration statement is not effective in circumstances not permitted by our agreement with kingsbridge  then we must make a payment to kingsbridge  or issue kingsbridge additional shares in lieu of the payment  calculated on the basis of the number of shares held by kingsbridge exclusive of shares that kingsbridge may hold pursuant to exercise of the kingsbridge warrant and the change in the market price of our common stock during the period in which the use of the resale registration statement is suspended 
if the trading price of our common stock declines during a suspension of the resale registration statement  the blackout or other payment could be significant 
if we sell shares to kingsbridge under the ceff  or issue shares in lieu of a blackout payment  it will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current stockholders  and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
for each draw down under the ceff  we will issue shares to kingsbridge at a discount of up to from the volume weighted average price of our common stock 
if we draw down amounts under the ceff when our share price is decreasing  we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher 
issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing  and may further decrease our share price 

table of contents we may not be able to pursue all of our product research and development opportunities if we are unable to secure adequate funding for these programs 
the costs required to start or continue many of the programs that our intellectual property allow us to consider for further development are collectively greater that the funds currently available to us 
for example  we have successfully discovered three series of compounds that are specific gr ii antagonists but  unlike corlux  do not appear to block the progesterone receptor 
further development of these proprietary compounds  including cort  or any further development stemming from our method of use patents may be delayed or cancelled if we determine that such development may jeopardize our ability to complete the clinical development of corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression or for cushing s syndrome 
although our pivotal phase clinical trial in cushing s syndrome only requires patients  both site selection and enrollment could be an extended process 
delays in selection and initiation of clinical trial sites and or patient enrollment could extend the time and cost for completion or inhibit our ability to complete the trial at all 
cushing s syndrome is a rare disorder 
an estimated to of every one million people are newly diagnosed each year 
the majority of the sites that treat patients with cushing s syndrome are at academic institutions or large clinics in or affiliated with private hospitals 
academic institutions often take a prolonged period of time to complete the administrative activities required before a clinical trial can be initiated at that site 
because the disease is seen so infrequently  the process of identifying and screening the patients for participation in our study may be lengthy 
any delays in the process of identifying and recruiting the clinical sites or identifying and screening the patients for enrollment in the study could delay the completion of the study  increase the cost or even inhibit our ability to complete the trial at all 
we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future 
we are a development stage company with no current source of product revenue 
we have a limited history of operations and have focused primarily on clinical trials  and if the outcome of our clinical trials supports it  we plan to seek fda regulatory clearance to market corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
historically  we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we do not know when or if we will generate product revenue 
subject to our ability to raise additional funds  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with the clinical trials and other development activities for corlux and for other product candidates 
we expect to incur significant expenses related to the preparation for commercializing corlux and for the product s launch  if the fda approves our nda 
as a result  we expect that our losses will increase for the foreseeable future 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether or when we will become profitable 
we depend on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage the trials and to perform related data collection and analysis  and  as a result  we may face costs and delays outside of our control 
we rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis 
however  we may not be able to control the timing of identification and selection of appropriate sites for our planned trials and the amount and timing of resources that 
table of contents the clinical sites that conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials 
if our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedules  we will be unable to complete our trials or to complete them as planned  which could delay or prevent us from completing the clinical development of corlux or other development programs 
we have signed an agreement with a contract research organization  or cro  that is conducting our ongoing phase trial evaluating corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  study  to supervise and monitor clinical site performance and to perform investigator supervision  data collection and analysis for this trial 
we may not be able to maintain relationships with this or other cros or with the clinical investigators and the clinical sites through the completion of all trial activities without delays in anticipated timing of trial activities or excessive expenditures 
our agreements place substantial responsibilities on these parties  which could result in excessive expenditures for our clinical trials if these parties fail to perform as expected 
for example  if any of our clinical trial sites fail to comply with fda approved good clinical practices  we may be unable to use the data gathered at those sites 
if these cros  clinical investigators  clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines  or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or for other reasons  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialize  corlux 
the conduct of any future clinical trials will likely also be conducted through the use of cros and clinical research sites 
the conduct  timing and cost of these trials will be subject to the same kinds of risks as discussed above 
in study  our ongoing clinical trial evaluating corlux for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we have engaged medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services 
if patients are uncomfortable or unwilling to participate in the centralized rating process or if medavante is unable to provide services in a satisfactory manner over the course of the trial  we may not see any improvement in the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments 
in connection with our ongoing phase trial evaluating corlux for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  study  we have engaged medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services 
medavante is providing centralized psychometric assessments via high resolution video conferencing 
the use of medavante s centralized rating services is expected to increase the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments 
medavante has provided similar centralized rating services to companies conducting clinical studies in various psychiatric disorders 
however  they have not previously provided centralized rating services to any study in patients with psychotic depression 
although corcept and medavante conducted a small pilot evaluation in patients with psychotic depression to assess patient receptivity  we cannot be certain that centralized rating will be successful in the patients enrolled in our study 
if patients are uncomfortable or unwilling to participate in the centralized rating process or if medavante is unable to provide services in a satisfactory manner over the course of the trial  we may not see any improvement in the accuracy or reliability of the psychiatric assessments 
such a result might diminish the likelihood of a successful trial or a definitive demonstration of the efficacy of corlux in treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
the use of psychiatric rating services provided by a third party  medavante  as an additional screening element may continue to slow the pace of enrollment in study thus far we have seen a higher than anticipated incidence of potential patients who do not meet appropriate criteria for entrance into our trial for diagnostic and other clinical reasons during the screening of patients for study we believe that this is the result of improved accuracy in the screening process with the use of the 
table of contents medavante centralized rating services as an additional step in the selection of patients appropriate for inclusion in the study 
while we anticipate that the incidence of patients who do not meet the appropriate criteria for enrollment in the trial will decrease over time as the investigators improve their ability to identify potential patients for inclusion in the study and we identify which clinical trial sites have the greatest access to our targeted patient population  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
a continued lower enrollment rate could result in delays in the timing of anticipated completion of the trial and increased study costs 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our product candidates  including corlux  and our business will be harmed 
the research  testing  manufacturing  selling and marketing of product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  in which regulations differ from country to country 
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval typically is an uncertain process  is costly and takes many years 
in addition  failure to comply with the fda and other applicable foreign and us regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions 
these include warning letters  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending ndas  or supplements to approved ndas 
regulatory approval of an nda or nda supplement is never guaranteed 
despite the time  resources and effort expended  failure can occur at any stage 
the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process for human medicines 
the fda can deny  delay or limit approval of a product candidate for many reasons including the fda may not find that the candidate is safe  the fda may not find data from the clinical or preclinical testing to be sufficient  or the fda may not approve our or our third party manufacturers processes or facilities 
future governmental action or changes in fda policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an nda in the united states 
in addition  because the only currently fda approved use of mifepristone is the termination of pregnancy  we expect that the label for corlux will include some limitations  including a warning that it should not be used by pregnant women or women seeking to become pregnant 
if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  including corlux  we will also be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review  such as continued safety reporting requirements  and we may also be subject to additional fda post marketing obligations 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we may not be permitted to market our product candidates 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing follow up studies 
in addition  if the fda approves any of our product candidates  the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping for the medicine will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the medicine  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  may result in restrictions on the marketing of the medicine  and could include withdrawal of the medicine from the market 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from commercializing our product candidates abroad 
we intend to commercialize our product candidates in international markets 
outside the united states  we can commercialize a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and  in some cases  pricing approval  from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process  and  in some cases  additional risks 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that 
table of contents required to obtain fda approval 
we have not taken any actions to obtain foreign approvals 
we may not develop our product candidates in the clinic in order to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda 
we may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market 
the fast track designation for the development program of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process 
if a human medicine is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and the medicine demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition  the sponsor of an ind may apply for fda fast track designation for a particular indication 
marketing applications submitted by sponsors of product candidates in fast track development may qualify for expedited fda review under the policies and procedures offered by the fda  but the fast track designation does not assure any such qualification 
although we have obtained a fast track designation from the fda for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we may not experience a faster development process  review or approval compared to applications considered for approval under conventional fda procedures 
in addition  the fda may withdraw our fast track designation at any time 
if we lose our fast track designation  the approval process may be delayed 
in addition  our fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that corlux will receive regulatory approval for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
even if we receive approval for the marketing and sale of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  or endogenous cushing s syndrome  corlux may never be accepted as a treatment for the approved indications 
many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for any other approved indication 
even if the fda approves corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or any other indication  physicians may not adopt corlux 
physicians will recommend the use of corlux only if they determine  based on experience  clinical data  side effect profiles and other factors  that it is preferable to other products or treatments then in use 
acceptance of corlux among influential practitioners may be essential for market acceptance of corlux 
other factors that may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of corlux include the effectiveness of corlux  including any side effects  as compared to alternative treatment methods  the product labeling or product insert required by the fda for corlux  the cost effectiveness of corlux and the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement  in particular from government payors such as medicare and medicaid  for patients using corlux  the timing of market entry of corlux relative to competitive products  the intentional restriction of distribution of corlux to physicians treating the target patient population  the extent and success of our sales and marketing efforts  
table of contents the rate of adoption of corlux by physicians and by target patient population  and negative publicity concerning corlux  ru or mifepristone 
the failure of corlux to achieve market acceptance would prevent us from generating meaningful product revenue 
public perception of the active ingredient in corlux  mifepristone or ru  may limit our ability to market and sell corlux 
the active ingredient in corlux  mifepristone  or ru  is used to terminate pregnancy 
as a result  mifepristone has been and continues to be the subject of considerable ethical and political debate in the united states and elsewhere 
public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to engage alternative manufacturers and may limit the commercial acceptance of corlux by patients and physicians 
even though we intend to create measures to minimize the likelihood of the prescribing of corlux to a pregnant woman  physicians may decline to prescribe corlux to a woman simply to avoid altogether any risk of unintentionally terminating a pregnancy 
we intend to create measures for controlling the distribution of corlux to reduce the potential for diversion 
however  controlled distribution may negatively impact sales of corlux 
we have no manufacturing capabilities and we currently depend on third parties to manufacture the active ingredient and the tablets for corlux 
the tablet manufacturer is a single source supplier 
if these suppliers are unable to continue manufacturing corlux and we are unable to contract quickly with alternative sources  our business will be harmed 
we currently have no experience in  and we do not own facilities for  nor do we plan to develop facilities for  manufacturing any products 
we have agreements with two manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  of mifepristone and an agreement with a tablet manufacturer for development quantities of corlux 
the tablet manufacturer is a single source supplier to us 
our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by either party at any time 
although we anticipate engaging our current tablet supplier to produce commercial quantities of corlux  we cannot guarantee that we will enter into an agreement with them on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient or corlux tablets from our contract manufacturers  we may not be able to manufacture our required quantities or identify alternate manufacturers of mifepristone or corlux tablets in a timely manner or on reasonable terms  if at all 
if our third party manufacturers of corlux fail to comply with fda regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements  our product development and commercialization efforts may be delayed 
we depend on third party manufacturers to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient in corlux and to manufacture corlux tablets 
these suppliers and manufacturers must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations and guidelines 
our suppliers and manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages of qualified personnel 
their failure to follow cgmp or other regulatory requirements and to document their compliance with cgmp may lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study or the termination or hold on a clinical study  or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for corlux 
failure of our third party suppliers and manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could harm our business 
if the operations of any current or future supplier or manufacturer were to become unavailable for any reason  commercialization of corlux could be delayed and our revenue from product sales could be reduced 

table of contents we may use a different third party manufacturer to produce commercial quantities of corlux than we are using in our clinical trials 
the fda may require us to conduct a study to demonstrate that the tablets used in our clinical trials are equivalent to the final commercial product 
if we are unable to establish that the tablets are equivalent or if the fda disagrees with the results of our study  commercial launch of corlux would be delayed 
if we or others identify side effects after our product candidates are on the market  we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials  change the labeling of our future products or withdraw our future products from the market  any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our product candidates are on the market regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals  we may be required to reformulate our future products  conduct additional clinical trials  make changes in labeling of such products or implement changes to or obtain re approvals of our manufacturing facilities  we may experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and we may become the target of lawsuits  including class action lawsuits 
any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing these product candidates 
if corlux or future product candidates conflict with the patents of others or if we become involved in other intellectual property disputes  we could have to engage in costly litigation or obtain a license and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for the use of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and other potential uses of gr ii antagonists 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our intellectual property and erode our competitive advantage 
to date  we own seven issued us patents and have exclusively licensed three issued us patents  in each case along with a number of corresponding foreign patents or patent applications 
we also have six us method of use patent applications for gr ii antagonists and three composition of matter patent applications covering specific gr ii antagonists 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering our product candidates as we deem appropriate 
we have exclusively licensed three issued us patents from stanford university for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression  which is commonly referred to as psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia  including early alzheimer s disease 
we bear the costs of protecting and defending the rights to these patents 
in order to maintain the exclusive license to these patents until their expiration  we are obligated to make milestone and royalty payments to stanford university 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under this agreement 
if we become noncompliant  we may lose the right to commercialize corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia and our business would be materially harmed 
in addition  if stanford university were to terminate our corlux license due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 

table of contents our patent applications and patents licensed or issued to us may be challenged by third parties and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
for example  in  akzo nobel filed an observation challenging the claims of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in  we filed a rebuttal to the epo that responded to the points raised by akzo nobel 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application and in july  this patent was issued 
in april we received notification that there will be no opposition proceedings in europe in regards to this patent 
our presently pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
for example  the arguments presented by akzo nobel could be raised in the united states either before the us patent and trademark office or in a court of law 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued to us  or which may be issued to us in the future  may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our competitors may produce competing products based on our technology  which would impair our ability to compete 
if a third party were successful in asserting an infringement claim against us  we could be forced to pay damages and prevented from developing  manufacturing or marketing our potential products 
we do not have liability insurance for patent infringements 
a third party could require us to obtain a license to continue to use their intellectual property  and we may not be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
we believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources 
regardless of the merit of any particular claim  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  is expensive and diverts management s attention from other business 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our ability to compete in the market could be diminished 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information 
nevertheless  these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if they do not adequately protect our rights  third parties could use our proprietary information  which could diminish our ability to compete in the market 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our product candidates may breach their agreements with us regarding our trade secrets and other proprietary information  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through means not currently foreseen 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative products that are equal or superior to our product candidates without infringing on any of our proprietary information or trade secrets 
our licensed patent covering the use of mifepristone to treat psychotic depression is a method of use patent rather than a composition of matter patent  which increases the risk that physicians will prescribe another manufacturer s mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression rather than corlux 
we have an exclusive license from stanford university to a patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists  including mifepristone  for the treatment of psychotic depression 
a method of use patent covers only a specified use of a particular compound  not a particular composition of matter 
all of our issued patents and all but three of our nine us patent applications are method of use patents 
because none of our issued patents covers the composition of mifepristone or any other compound  we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist not covered by our composition of matter patent applications in indications not covered by our method of use patents 
if others receive approval to manufacture and market mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist  physicians could prescribe mifepristone or any other gr ii 
table of contents antagonist for patients with psychotic depression instead of corlux 
although any such off label use would violate our licensed patent  effectively monitoring compliance with our licensed patent may be difficult and costly 
in addition  if others develop a treatment for psychotic depression that works through a mechanism which does not involve the gr ii receptor  physicians could prescribe that treatment instead of corlux 
the composition of matter patents on our families of novel selective glucocorticoid antagonists may not be issued and we would not be able to prevent competition from others 
we have filed composition of matter patent claims on three families of novel selective glucocorticoid antagonists but not all of these have been issued 
these have been filed internationally  with applications for two of the three families already granted in europe 
in the united states  applications for two of the three families are in active prosecution  and are moving toward allowance 
examination has not yet begun in the us on our third novel selective gr ii family 
we cannot be certain that these patents will be issued to us 
if these patents are not issued we may not be able to prevent others from developing competing compounds 
the competing products could be prescribed by physicians instead of those developed by us 
we may be subject to fines  penalties or injunctions if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or off label uses  resulting in damage to our reputation and business 
our promotional materials and training methods must comply with fda and other applicable laws and regulations  including the prohibition of the promotion of a drug for a use that has not been cleared or approved by fda 
use of a drug outside its approved indications is known as off label use 
physicians may use our products off label  as the fda does not restrict or regulate a physician s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine 
however  if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off label use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
in that event  our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired 
although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off label promotion of our products  the fda or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off label promotion 
in addition  the off label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients  and  in turn  the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us 
our efforts to discover  develop and commercialize new product candidates beyond corlux are at a very early stage 
if we fail to identify and develop additional uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to market additional products 
to develop additional potential sources of revenue  we believe that we must identify and develop additional product candidates 
we own or have exclusively licensed issued us patents covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat psychotic depression  weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication  early dementia  mild cognitive impairment  psychosis associated with cocaine addiction  delirium  ect  gastroesophageal reflux disease  down s syndrome and stress disorders  in addition to six us method of use patent applications covering gr ii antagonists for the treatment of a number of other metabolic and psychiatric disorders and three us composition of matter patent applications covering specific gr ii antagonists 
we may not develop or continue to develop product candidates for any of the indications or compounds covered by our patents and patent applications 
typically  there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials  so our product development efforts may not lead to commercially viable products 
the use of gr ii antagonists may not be effective to treat these conditions or any other indications 
in addition  
table of contents we could discover that the use of gr ii antagonists in these patient populations has unacceptable side effects or is otherwise not safe 
we may elect to enter into collaboration arrangements with respect to one or more of our product candidates 
if we do enter into such an arrangement  we would be dependent on a collaborative partner for the success of the product candidates developed under the arrangement 
any future collaborative partner may fail to successfully develop or commercialize a product candidate under a collaborative arrangement 
we only have significant clinical experience with corlux and we may determine that corlux is not desirable for uses other than for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or cushing s syndrome 
in that event  we would have to identify and may need to secure rights to a different gr ii antagonist 
for example  we do not intend to develop corlux for mitigation of the weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa  risperdal  or other atypical antipsychotics  even though we have reported positive results in the proof of concept studies described elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are pursuing other gr ii antagonists for this use and may pursue additional compounds 
the compounds developed pursuant to our preclinical and discovery research programs  including cort  may fail to generate commercially viable product candidates in spite of the resources we may dedicate to the program 
even if product candidates are identified  we may abandon further development efforts before we reach clinical trials or after expending significant expense and time conducting clinical trials due to financial constraints  concerns over safety  efficacy of the product candidates or for other reasons 
moreover  governmental authorities may enact new legislation or regulations that could limit or restrict our development efforts 
if we are unable to successfully discover and commercialize new uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations 
we may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover those claims 
we may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our products has resulted in adverse effects or that our product candidates are not effective  whether by participants in our clinical trials for corlux or other product candidates  or by patients using our future products 
a product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about our product candidates safety or efficacy and could limit our ability to sell a product by preventing or interfering with product commercialization 
in some cases  less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are not known until long after the fda approves the product for marketing 
the active ingredient in corlux is used to terminate pregnancy 
therefore  necessary and strict precautions must be taken by clinicians using the medicine in our clinical trials and  if approved by the fda  physicians prescribing the medicine to women with childbearing potential  to insure that the medicine is not administered to pregnant women 
the failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product claims 
we have only limited product liability insurance coverage  with limits that we believe to be customary for a development stage company 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our product candidates 
defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management s attention from conducting our business 
if a third party successfully sues us for any injury caused by our product candidates  our liability could exceed our total assets 
if corlux is approved and we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate coverage and reimbursement for it from third party payors  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
there is significant uncertainty related to the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medications 
the commercial success of our potential medications in both domestic and international markets is dependent on whether third party coverage and reimbursement is available 
table of contents for them 
government payors  including medicare and medicaid  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medicines  and  as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our medications 
the continuing efforts of government and other third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may limit our revenues 
our dependence on the commercial success of corlux alone makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts 
accordingly  even if corlux or future product candidates are approved for commercial sale  unless government and other third party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our future products  physicians may not prescribe them 
we intend to sell corlux directly to hospitals if we receive fda approval 
as a result  we will need to obtain approval from hospital formularies to receive wide spread third party coverage and reimbursement 
if we fail to obtain that approval  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls 
also  the trends toward managed health care in the united states and proposed legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for our future products or the exclusion of such products from reimbursement programs 
we face competition from companies with substantial financial  technical and marketing resources  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for other indications 
if approved for commercial use  corlux as a treatment for psychotic depression will compete with established treatments  including ect and combination medicinal therapy 
combination medicinal therapy consists of the use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines  not currently approved for the treatment of psychotic depression 
the antipsychotics are prescribed for off label use by physicians to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression  which is the clinical target of corlux 
antipsychotics include bristol myers squibb s abilify  novartis clozaril  pfizer s geodon and navane  ortho mcneil s haldol  janssen pharmaceutica s risperdal  astrazeneca s seroquel  glaxosmithkline s stelazine and thorazine  mylan s mellaril  schering corporation s trilafon and eli lilly s zyprexa 
corlux may not compete effectively with these established treatments 
we are aware of one clinical trial conducted by the pharmaceutical division of akzo nobel  for a new chemical entity for the treatment of psychotic depression 
this new chemical entity is a gr ii antagonist  the commercial use of which would be covered by our patent 
as discussed above  in  akzo nobel filed an observation in our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression  in which akzo nobel challenged the claims of that patent application 
in  we filed a rebuttal to the epo that responded to the points raised by akzo nobel 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application 
in july  the patent was issued 
we are not aware of any public disclosures by any company  other than akzo nobel  regarding the development of new products to treat psychotic depression 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies  as well as specialized pharmaceutical firms  universities and public and private research institutions 
moreover  we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made 
these competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may succeed with the development and commercialization of medicinal products that are superior to and more cost effective than corlux 
many of our competitors and related private and public research and academic institutions have greater experience  more financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing human medicines  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and commercializing products 

table of contents accordingly  corlux may not be an effective competitor against established treatments and our present or potential competitors may succeed in developing medicinal products that are superior to corlux or render corlux obsolete or non competitive 
if we are unable to establish corlux as a superior and cost effective treatment for psychotic depression  or any future use  we may be unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business 
we may face competition from other companies who attempt to develop mifepristone for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of corlux for the treatment of that disorder and which could have a negative impact on future revenues from the commercialization of corlux for any indication 
we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has received an orphan drug designation in the united states and europe for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a phase ii clinical trial in europe and the united states for this indication 
if this product is approved for commercialization before corlux  our potential future revenue could be reduced by the possibility of off label use of mifepristone for psychotic depression or for other subtypes of cushing s syndrome 
rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete 
pharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change and we expect that they will continue to do so 
our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies 
any products and processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any or all expenses incurred in connection with their development 
rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have no sales staff and limited marketing activities and will need to develop sales and marketing capabilities to successfully commercialize corlux and any future uses of gr ii antagonists 
our employees have limited experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and we currently have no sales staff and limited marketing activities 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop a sales and marketing force or enter into arrangements with others to market and sell our future products 
we currently plan to establish a small  specialty sales force to market and sell corlux in the united states for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for cushing s syndrome 
however  our sales and marketing efforts may not be successful or cost effective 
in the event that the commercial launch of corlux is delayed due to fda requirements or other reasons  we may establish a sales and marketing force too early relative to the launch of corlux 
this may be expensive  and our investment would be lost if the sales and marketing force could not be retained 
if our efforts to develop a sales and marketing force are not successful  cost effective and timely  we may not achieve profitability 
we may need to increase the size of our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing growth 
as we expand our research and development efforts and develop a sales and marketing organization  we expect to experience growth  which may strain our operations  product development and other managerial and operating resources 
future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain and integrate additional employees 
to date  we have relied on a small management team  including a number of part time contributors 
our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
to that end  we must be able to manage our research and development efforts effectively  manage our clinical trials effectively  
table of contents integrate additional management  clinical development  administrative and sales and marketing personnel  expand the size and composition of our management team  develop our administrative  accounting and management information systems and controls  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
we may not be able to accomplish these tasks  and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our business 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel  we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts 
we depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including joseph k 
belanoff  md  our chief executive officer  and robert l 
roe  md  our president 
we do not have agreements with any of our executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us or employment insurance covering any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors 
the loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research  development and commercialization efforts without their expertise 
our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key research  technical  sales  marketing  managerial and financial personnel  and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas 
we face intense competition for such personnel from numerous companies  as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations in the highly competitive northern california business area 
although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to date  we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel in the future 
the inability to attract and retain these personnel could result in delays in the research  development and commercialization of our potential products 
if we acquire other gr ii antagonists or other technologies or potential products  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire other gr ii antagonists  particularly gr ii antagonists that do not terminate pregnancy 
we may also be able to acquire other technologies or potential products that are complementary to our operating plan 
we currently have no commitments  agreements or plans for any acquisitions 
the process of acquiring rights to another gr ii antagonist or any other potential product or technology may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquired potential product or technology 
future acquisitions could dilute our stockholders ownership interest in us and could cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar events could cause damage to our or our manufacturers facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
because our executive offices are located in the san francisco bay area and some of our current manufacturers are located in earthquake prone areas  our business is vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters or other similarly disruptive events  including earthquake  fire  flood  power loss and communications failures 
in addition  political considerations relating to mifepristone may put us and our manufacturers at increased risk for terrorist attacks  protests or other disruptive events 
if any disaster or other similar event were 
table of contents to occur  we may not be able to operate our business and our manufacturers may not be able to produce our product candidates 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover  and our insurance policies may exclude coverage for  our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
risks related to our stock the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile due to the limited number of shares of our common stock held by non affiliates of the company or factors influencing the stock market and opportunities for sale at any given time may be limited 
we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will exist at any time 
holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active 
during the week period ended march   our average daily trading volume has been approximately  shares and the intra day sales prices per share of our common stock ranged from to 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders control approximately of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including our cash and short term investment position  actual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials  actual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors products  changes in the expected or actual timing of our development programs or our competitors potential development programs  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations by us  our collaborators or our competitors  new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  general market and economic conditions  including those seen as a result of the recent worldwide financial credit crisis  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  developments concerning collaborations  trading volume of our common stock  limited number of shares of our common stock held by our non affiliates  maintaining compliance with the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which we are listed  announcement of  or expectation of  additional financing efforts  and sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq capital market and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources 
if we fail to continue to meet all applicable nasdaq capital market requirements  our stock could be delisted by the nasdaq capital market 
if delisting occurs  it would adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and harm our business 
if we are unable to meet any of the nasdaq listing requirements in the future  the nasdaq capital market staff could determine to delist our common stock  the delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
such delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
securities analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports  and this may have a negative impact on our common stock s market price 
securities analysts currently covering our common stock may discontinue research coverage 
additional securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock 
a lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly and significantly 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  rules mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of  and a global settlement reached in between the sec  other regulatory analysts and a number of investment banks have led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated 
in particular  many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research 
it may be difficult for companies such as ours with smaller market capitalizations to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock 
this could have a negative effect on our market price 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock 
as additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market  the supply of our common stock will increase  which could decrease the price 
substantially all of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale  subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions 
we may be required to pay significant amounts if we are not able to meet our obligations under our outstanding registration rights agreements 
the registration rights agreement covering the approximately million shares issued in a private offering in march and an additional approximately million shares underlying warrants issued in connection with the offering provide that if we failed to file or cause to be declared effective the registration statement covering the resale of these shares prior to a specified deadlines  or fail to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement subject to limited permissible suspension periods  we may be required to pay the holders of such shares and warrants liquidated damages at the rate of of the purchase price of these shares and warrants per month  up to a total of 
the registration statement covering the resale of the shares and shares underlying 
table of contents the warrants sold in this transaction was declared effective by the sec on november  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources  since the registration statement was not declared effective within the time frame specified in the registration rights agreement  we became obligated to pay the investors in this financing liquidated damages of approximately million for the period from july through november  as noted above  if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of this registration statement  we may be obligated to pay additional liquidated damage amounts in the future 
see the discussion above under risks related to our business regarding risks associated with the committed equity financing facility ceff  including the risks regarding registration rights under that agreement 
if we are required to pay significant amounts under these or future registration rights agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to finance our operations 
our officers  directors and principal stockholders acting as a group  will be able to significantly influence corporate actions 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders control approximately of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control 
this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
we may incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq capital market  have and will continue to result in increased costs to us 
the new rules could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or our board committees  or as executive officers 
at present  we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs related to these new rules and regulations or the timing of such costs 
compliance with public company obligations  including the securities laws and regulations  is costly and requires significant management resources  and we may fail to comply 
we are a small company with limited resources 
until april  we operated as a private company  not subject to many of the requirements applicable to public companies 
the federal securities laws and regulations  including the corporate governance and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
these requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  principal financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 

table of contents in addition  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
this requirement first applied to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  in addition  the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
on june   in release no 
 the sec announced a postponement of the application of this attestation requirement for non accelerated filers  which became effective on september  with this change  the requirement for the auditor s attestation and report will first apply to our annual report on form k for our fiscal year ending december  uncertainty exists regarding our ability to comply with these requirements by applicable deadlines and to maintain compliance in future years 
if we are unable to complete the required assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in or in future years or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the required deadline in and as of future year ends  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies 
accounting methods and policies for business and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies  including policies regarding expensing employee stock options  are subject to further review  interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities  including the sec 
for example  in december  the financial accounting standards board adopted financial accounting standard r  share based payment 
this statement  which we adopted in  requires the recording of expense for the fair value of stock options granted 
as a result  our operating expenses have increased and are likely to continue to increase 
we rely heavily on stock options to compensate existing employees and attract new employees 
because we are now required to expense stock options on a fair value basis  we may choose to reduce our reliance on stock options as a compensation tool 
if we reduce our use of stock options  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
although we believe that our accounting practices are consistent with current accounting pronouncements  changes to or interpretations of accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify  restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more difficult  even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
some of these provisions divide our board into three classes with only a portion of our directors subject to election at each annual meeting  allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent 
in addition  a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws 
our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our chairman  president or the board of directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
these provisions may prevent or delay a change in our board of directors or our management  which is appointed by our board of directors 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
section may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions in our charter  bylaws and under delaware law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions

overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of medications for the treatment of severe psychiatric and metabolic diseases 
since our inception in may  we have been developing our lead product  corlux  a glucocorticoid receptor ii  or gr ii  antagonist 
psychotic depression we are developing our lead compound  corlux  for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic major depression  under an exclusive patent license from stanford university 
psychotic major depression  or pmd  will hereinafter be referred to as psychotic depression 
the united states food and drug administration  or fda  has granted fast track status to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
between august and march we 
table of contents announced the results of our initial three phase trials in which corlux was evaluated for treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we reported the results of study  the last of the three phase trials during the study did not achieve statistical significance with respect to the primary endpoint  improvement in the brief psychiatric rating scale positive symptom subscale  or bprs pss  at day and at day however  there was a statistically significant correlation between the plasma levels of corlux and clinical outcome 
response rates for patients whose plasma levels rose above nanograms of corlux per milliliter of plasma were statistically different than both those patients whose plasma levels were below that threshold and those patients who received placebo 
in particular  those patients in study who achieved a corlux concentration of nanograms per milliliter of plasma separated from the placebo group with statistical significance on the primary endpoint 
conversely  at substantially lower plasma levels of corlux  there was no distinguishable difference in response rates between patients who received corlux and those receiving placebo 
this study confirms a similar finding in study that at higher plasma levels the drug candidate is able to demonstrate greater clinical benefit than the placebo group 
further  the incidence of serious adverse events did not differ between placebo and any of the three corlux dose groups 
data aggregated from our major efficacy studies of similar design  study  study  study and study  observed cases indicate that the patients who received corlux separated from the placebo group with statistical significance for the endpoint  improvement in the bprs pss at day and at day in addition  using the same endpoint  patients who achieved a drug level in their plasma that was greater than the nanograms per milliliter threshold mentioned above  statistically separated from both those patients whose plasma levels were below this threshold and those patients who received placebo 
we believe that the confirmation of a correlation between drug concentration and clinical response  as well as other observations from study and our other two completed phase clinical trials  serves as a strong basis for our current phase study study  which commenced enrollment in march of the protocol for this trial incorporates what we have learned from the three completed trials to address the established relationship between increased drug plasma levels and clinical response and attempts to decrease the random variability observed in the results of the psychometric instruments used to measure efficacy 
in study  corcept prospectively tested and confirmed that patients whose plasma levels rose above a predetermined threshold statistically separated from both those patients whose plasma levels were below the threshold and those patients who received placebo  this threshold was established from data produced in earlier studies 
as expected  patients who took mg of corlux developed higher drug plasma levels than patients who received lower doses 
further  there was no discernable difference in the incidence of adverse events between placebo and any of the three corlux dose groups in study based on this information  we are using a corlux dose of mg once per day for seven days in study in addition  we also are utilizing a third party centralized rating service to independently evaluate the patients for entry into the study as well as for response 
we believe the centralization of this process will improve the consistency of rating across clinical trial sites and reduce the background noise that was illustrated in earlier studies and is endemic to many psychopharmacologic studies 
we believe that this change in dose  as well as the other modifications to the protocol  should allow us to demonstrate the efficacy of corlux in the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of psychotic depression 
due to the relatively high cost of this program  length of the trial and current financial constraints  we are scaling back our planned rate of spending on this trail and extending the timeline for its completion 
cushing s syndrome in july  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
cushing s syndrome is a disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body s tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol 
sometimes called hypercortisolism  it is relatively rare and most commonly affects adults aged to an estimated to of every one million people are newly diagnosed each year 

table of contents orphan drug designation is a special status granted by the fda to encourage the development of treatments for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  patients in the united states 
drugs that receive orphan drug designation obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of drug approval  as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs  marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the fda in the drug development process 
the investigational new drug application ind for the evaluation of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome was opened in september the fda has indicated that our single patient open label study may provide a reasonable basis for the submission of a new drug application nda for this indication 
this trial was opened for enrollment in december we are targeting completion of enrollment by the end of  and should have accumulated a full data set on all patients by mid management of weight gain induced by antipsychotics in  we published the results of studies in rats that demonstrated that corlux  a potent gr ii cortisol receptor antagonist  both reduced the weight gain associated with the ongoing use of olanzapine and mitigated the weight gain associated with the initiation of treatment with olanzapine the active ingredient in zyprexa 
this study was paid for by eli lilly and company lilly 
during we announced positive results from our clinical proof of concept study evaluating the ability of corlux to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa 
this study in lean healthy male volunteers was initiated during the first quarter of the results show a statistically significant reduction in weight gain in those subjects who took zyprexa plus corlux compared to those who took zyprexa alone 
also  the addition of corlux to treatment with zyprexa had a beneficial impact on secondary metabolic measures such as fasting insulin  and triglycerides and abdominal fat  as measured by waist circumference 
lilly provided zyprexa and financial support for this study 
in january we announced positive results from a similar proof of concept study evaluating the ability of corlux to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of johnson johnson s risperdal 
this study  which began in  confirmed the earlier results seen with corlux and zyprexa  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in weight and secondary metabolic endpoints of fasting insulin  triglycerides and abdominal fat  as measured by waist circumference 
the combination of zyprexa or risperdal and corlux is not approved for any indication 
the purpose of these studies was to explore the hypothesis that gr ii antagonists would mitigate weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications 
the group of medications known as atypical antipsychotics  including zyprexa  risperdal  clozaril and seroquel  are widely used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
all medications in this group are associated with treatment emergent weight gain of varying degrees and carry a warning label relating to treatment emergent hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus 
research in early  we initiated a discovery research program to identify and patent selective gr ii antagonists to develop a pipeline of products for proprietary use 
three distinct series of gr ii antagonists were identified 
composition of matter patents on two of the series have been allowed in europe  while substantive examination in the corresponding united states applications has not yet begun 
united states and european applications have been filed for composition of matter patents in the third series  and are currently undergoing substantive examination 
these compounds appear to be as potent as our lead product corlux in blocking cortisol but  unlike corlux  they do not appear to block the pr progesterone  er estrogen  ar androgen or gr i mineralocorticoid receptors 

table of contents new chemical entity cort in  we commenced a human microdosing study of one of our newly identified selective gr ii antagonists  cort  with xceleron limited utilizing their accelerator mass spectrometry technology 
in this microdosing study  we evaluated cort  a compound which develops particularly high plasma and brain concentrations in an animal model 
on may   we announced the results from this study  which demonstrated that cort was extremely well absorbed  demonstrated good bioavailability and had a half life that appears compatible with once a day oral dosing 
in addition  further pharmacokinetic testing of cort in a rat model indicated that a ten fold increase in oral dose milligrams per kilograms to milligrams per kilograms led to a proportional increase in the amount of compound detected in plasma 
in september  we signed a second agreement with lilly  under which lilly agreed to provide funding and provide olanzapine for two studies to test the effectiveness of cort in rat models of olanzapine induced weight gain 
in january we announced top line results from these studies of cort and olanzapine 
the results from the studies of both the prevention and reversal of antipsychotic induced weight gain were positive and statistically significant 
general our activities to date have included product development  designing  funding and overseeing clinical trials  regulatory affairs  and intellectual property prosecution and expansion 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our preferred and common stock and the public sale of common stock rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaborative payments payable to us  except for the limited revenue under the agreements with lilly discussed above 
we are in the development stage and have incurred significant losses since our inception 
we have not generated any revenue through december other than the revenue under the agreements with lilly  and do not expect to generate significant revenue for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for corlux  discovery research  non clinical activities such as toxicology and carcinogenicity studies  manufacturing process development and regulatory activities  as well as general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our corlux clinical development program  apply for regulatory approvals  initiate development of newly identified gr ii antagonists for various indications  continue our discovery research program  acquire and develop treatments in other therapeutic areas  establish sales and marketing capabilities and expand our operations 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of our corlux clinical trials  uncertainties associated with securing financing  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our investment in manufacturing set up  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
our ability to successfully generate revenues in the foreseeable future is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to finance our operations and develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and market our lead product 

table of contents results of operations collaboration revenue collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with our agreements with lilly discussed above under the caption overview management of weight gain induced by antipsychotics 
under these agreements  lilly agreed to supply the zyprexa and olanzapine and pay for the costs of the studies 
we are required to perform development activities as specified in the agreements and we are reimbursed based on the costs associated with the conduct of the trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue is recognized as the services are rendered in accordance with the agreements 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately  and  respectively  under these agreements 
there will be no significant revenue under the agreements in the future as the majority of the activities were completed by december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as the costs of discovery research  pre clinical studies  clinical trial preparations  enrollment and monitoring expenses  regulatory costs  the costs of manufacturing development and the costs of manufacture and or acquisition of clinical trial materials 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses reflects clinical trial cost increases of approximately million related to new trials in psychotic depression  cushing s syndrome and the mitigation of weight gain caused by risperidal  which were partially offset by decreases of approximately million due to the substantial completion of our earlier phase clinical trials for psychotic depression  our cardiac study and our earlier proof of concept study in the mitigation of zyprexa induced weight gain in during  we also performed two smaller clinical studies to test formulation development and drug drug interaction at a cost of approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to  there were also increases in contract research expenses of approximately  due to basic research work on new chemical compounds  approximately  related to other research and preclinical work with our selective new gr ii antagonist  cort  and approximately  of costs associated with the rat studies using this compound in combination with olanzapine  which are being conducted in connection with the agreement with lilly discussed above 
in addition  during the year ended december   there was an increase in manufacturing expenses of approximately  due to the acquisition and manufacture of materials for the new clinical trials and manufacturing process development 
during the year ended december   as compared to  there were also increases in consulting expenses of approximately  and in staffing costs of approximately  to provide the resources necessary to support the increasing trial activities  which included increases in non cash stock based compensation of approximately  the expansion of the trial activities also caused an increase in travel costs of approximately  and in the allocation of facilities cost of approximately  during as compared to research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses reflects clinical trial cost decreases of approximately million due to the substantial completion of our earlier phase clinical trials for psychotic depression in late and early  which were partially offset by approximately  in costs associated with the preparations for our upcoming psychotic depression trial and increases in clinical trial costs related to other programs of approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to  there were also increases in contract research expenses of approximately  due to basic research work in new chemical compounds and the initiation of the micro dosing study on a selected compound  increases in analytical testing of approximately  and increases in manufacturing expenses of approximately  due to the manufacture of additional materials for upcoming clinical trials and manufacturing process development 
in addition  during the year ended december  as compared to  there were decreases in pre clinical studies of approximately  and staffing expenses of approximately  which included decreases in non cash stock based compensation of approximately  the 
table of contents decreases in staffing expenses were offset by increases in consulting and professional fees of  for as compared to research and development expenses discussed above included stock based compensation charges related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and the increase in expense between and was the result of expense related to new option grants calculated on a straight line basis  which was partially offset by the decrease of expense due to the declining scale of expense related to earlier option grants that were being expensed using the graded vesting method 
the decrease in expense between and was due principally to the cancellation of unvested options due to the resignation of an employee early in  which was partially offset by increases in expense related to options granted during in addition  during the years ended december  and  upon the termination of employees or the change in status of employees who worked in a development function to consultants  we recorded reversals of approximately  and  respectively  of previously reported stock based compensation expense  which represents the difference between the expense recorded and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the service of these individuals as employees 
there were no terminations or conversions to consultant during below is a summary of our research and development expenses by major project year ended december  project in thousands corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression corlux for other clinical programs drug discovery research cort pre clinical development stock based compensation total research and development expense we expect that research and development expenditures will increase during as compared to due to the continuation of our phase studies in cushing s syndrome and psychotic depression  and to the continued development of our proprietary selective gr ii antagonists 
research and development expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on the availability of additional funds to finance clinical development plans 
see also  liquidity and capital resources 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects in study patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of the drug in our trials 
the cost and timing of development of our selective gr ii antagonists will be dependent on our success in the effort and any difficulties that may be encountered 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and other professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in costs between years was primarily an increase of approximately  of legal costs related to patent activities and combined increases in staffing and consultancy costs of approximately  the changes in staffing costs include increases in non cash 
table of contents stock based compensation of approximately  and in recruiting costs of approximately  which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  related to bonus compensation 
the increase in stock based compensation was the net result of approximately  of costs associated with additional stock options being expensed under the straight line method  decreases of approximately  associated with the declining scale of expense of options accounted for under the graded vesting method and to the inclusion in of a reversal of approximately  of stock compensation expense in connection with the resignation of an officer  which represented the excess of expense under the graded vesting method as compared with the expense associated with stock options that actually vested prior to this termination 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in costs between years was comprised of decreases in legal and professional fees of approximately  due primarily to lower costs related to patents 
staffing costs also decreased by approximately  in as compared to the changes in staffing costs included a decrease in non cash stock based compensation of approximately  which was offset by increases in salaries and wages of  the decreases in stock based compensation expense during as compared to was the net result of the inclusion in of the reversal of approximately  of stock compensation expense in connection with the resignation of an officer  discussed above 
there were net increases of approximately  between and in stock based compensation charges related to stock options granted to officers and employees during  which were partially offset by declining expense of earlier options due to the decelerating scale of expense under the graded vesting method and options cancelled due to the termination 
general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately million million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the amount of general and administrative expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on our assessment of the staff necessary to support our continued clinical development activities and the availability of additional funds

interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net of investment management fees  was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in and  in interest income in included approximately  related to the note receivable in connection with the march financing 
this increase was partially offset by decreased yields and balances of invested funds as compared to the decrease in as compared to was attributable to decreased interest on investments due to lower average balance of invested funds that was partially offset by higher yields on the investment portfolios 
other expense 
other expense for in the amount of million is primarily related to the cost of liquidated damages due to the delay in the effectiveness of the registration statement of the securities sold in the march financing  which was discussed earlier in part ii item under the caption market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities sale of unregistered securities 
other expense was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in other expense in and includes interest expense on capitalized leases and state tax on capital which is based on our capital and asset positions as of each year end 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and at december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from public and private sales of our equity securities to fund our operations 

table of contents on march   we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock  at a price of per warrant in a private placement 
the warrants have a seven year term and an exercise price of per share 
the march financing generated approximately million in net cash proceeds  after deducting the costs of issuance  and including the collection in february of the note receivable related to this financing of million 
on march   we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group 
under the terms of the agreement  kingsbridge has committed to provide up to million of capital in exchange for newly issued shares of corcept s common stock for a period of up to three years after the securities and exchange commission declares effective the registration statement to be filed by corcept covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the ceff and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant discussed below 
the maximum number of shares that can be sold by corcept under this agreement is approximately million shares 
under the terms of the agreement  the determination of the exact timing and amount of any ceff financings will be made solely by corcept  subject to certain conditions 
the agreement currently requires a minimum stock price of per share to allow corcept to issue shares to kingsbridge under the ceff 
our share price is unpredictable and if it does not increase above per share we may not be able to access funds from kingsbridge under the ceff unless we are able to lower the minimum share price requirement 
based on the volume weighted average price on the nasdaq capital market for the company s common stock for the period from march   the date of the signing of the kingsbridge ceff  through march   the maximum amount of net proceeds that could be raised under the ceff is approximately million 
the actual amount of funds that can be raised under this agreement will be dependent on the number of shares actually sold under the agreement and the market value of corcept s stock during the pricing periods of each sale 
during the quarter ended september   the company sold a total of  shares of common stock to kingsbridge under the ceff at an average price of per share  for total proceeds of  at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments balances of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop our administrative infrastructure 
we expect cash used in operating activities to increase during and later years due to the continuation and expansion of our development programs for psychotic depression  cushing s syndrome and our selective gr ii antagonists  research activities  commercialization activities and general and administrative expenses 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources to fund our current operating plan into early  which will include the completion of the final reporting for our recently completed psychotic depression trials  the conduct of clinical trials in cushing s syndrome and psychotic depression  and continued development work on our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
we will have to perform additional clinical trials prior to submission of ndas for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for cushing s syndrome 
we may need to raise additional funds to complete the development of corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression and for cushing s syndrome 
in addition  we will need to raise additional funds to prepare for the commercialization of corlux for either of these indications  to develop a product for weight gain management associated with the use of antipsychotic medications and to continue and expand the development of our proprietary selective gr ii antagonists 
at any point in time we may have approximately  to million in our operating account with a third party financial institution 
while we monitor the cash balance in our operating account and transfer the funds in only as needed  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institution were to fail 
table of contents or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
on october   the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic implemented its temporary liquidity guarantee program 
under this program  non interest bearing commercial accounts are insured to an unlimited amount through december   thus mitigating our exposure to any possible bank failure 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies continuing into continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and wide spread recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies 
in the second half of  added concerns fueled by the us government conservatorship of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association  the declared bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc  the us government financial assistance to american international group inc  citibank  bank of america and other federal government interventions in the us financial system lead to increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers 
these factors have lead to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike  and a corresponding decrease in global infrastructure spending 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers  including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations

under our cancellable license agreement with stanford university  we are obligated to make nonrefundable minimum royalty payments of  annually for as long as we maintain our licenses with stanford  however  these payments are creditable against future royalties 
we also have other contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
a under our license agreement with stanford university related to the patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychosis associated with psychotic depression and early dementia  we are obligated to make milestone payments to stanford of  upon filing of an nda covering the licensed product and  upon fda approval of the licensed product 
the milestone payments payable to stanford under these licenses are creditable against future royalties 
b under the agreement with our contract research company we may be obligated to make milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events  including i patent filings in connection with the project  ii entries into phase clinical trials  and iii national regulatory approval of each product arising from work performed under the agreement  provided that sales of the product by the company or any future licensees reach  these obligations remain in force after the conclusion of work under the agreement 
there are no royalty obligations associated with this contract

as discussed above under part i  item  properties  in october  we signed an agreement to extend the office lease for an additional two year term at a monthly rental rate of approximately  plus operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with agreements signed with eli lilly and company  or lilly  in which lilly has agreed to support certain of the company s pre clinical and clinical proof of concept studies evaluating the ability of our product candidates to mitigate or prevent weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa olanzapine  an atypical antipsychotic medication 
under the agreements  lilly has agreed to supply the zyprexa and olanzapine and pay for the studies 
we are required to perform development activities as specified in these agreements and are reimbursed based on the costs associated with the conduct of the trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue is recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the agreement 
accruals of research and development costs 
we recorded accruals for estimated costs of research  pre clinical and clinical studies  and manufacturing development of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period 
accrued clinical trial costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts and service providers 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued includes our assessment of the information received from our third party contract research organizations and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued clinical trial expenses and actual clinical trial expenses 
however  actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation arises from the granting of stock options to employees and directors  as well as to non employees 
employees and directors we adopted statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  or sfas r  as of january  under the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payment arrangements with employees granted or modified after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees and directors prior to the effective date of statement r that remain non vested on the effective date 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had 
table of contents accounted for stock based compensation for options granted to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and had adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas because we had used the minimum value method for sfas pro forma disclosure requirements for options granted prior to the ipo in  we continue to account for the portion of these pre ipo grants that were non vested as of january  under the provisions of apb and related interpretations  with pro forma disclosures under sfas under apb  we recorded deferred stock based compensation related to option grants to employees and directors that represents the difference  if any  between the exercise price of an option and the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the time of our ipo in april  management was required to estimate the fair value of our common stock based on a variety of company and industry specific factors for the purpose of measuring the cost of the transaction and properly reflecting it in our financial statements 
since our ipo  all stock options have been granted at exercise prices that represent the closing price for the stock on the nasdaq capital market as of the date of grant 
deferred compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally five years 
our policy has been to use the graded vesting method for recognizing compensation costs for fixed employee awards for all awards granted through december  we amortize the deferred stock based compensation of employee options using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting periods of the applicable stock options 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in greater expense in earlier years than the straight line method 
upon termination of employment  the difference between the expense recorded under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the vesting of the related option is required to be reversed 
the deferred compensation costs related to these options has been fully recognized as of september  following is a brief synopsis of the implications of adoption of this statement on our accounting practices and the estimates and judgments that are considered in determining fair value in regard to stock option grants to employees and directors the grant date fair value for all new grants issued after january  is being amortized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options 
the expected term used in determining the fair value for options is based on the simple method prescribed by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  in staff accounting bulletins and  and considers the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual life of the options 
there has been no adjustment made to the expected term to adjust for employees expected exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior because we have a limited employee base and do not have sufficient historical information to determine such an adjustment 
the expected volatility of our common stock used in determining the fair value of option grants is based on a weighted average combination of the volatility of our own stock price and that of a group of peer companies since we do not have sufficient historical data from which to base an appropriate volatility assumption 
since we have a limited employee base  at this time we do not have sufficient historical information to determine a reasonable forfeiture rate for options that might not vest because of employee terminations 
when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded under the straight line method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 

table of contents as of december   the company had the following amounts of unrecognized compensation expense for employee options outstanding as of that date 
amount weighted average period in thousands in years options granted after ipo through  using fair value under sfas options granted after january   using fair value under sfas r total non employees stock based compensation related to option grants to non employees is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  based on the fair value of the options  which approximates the period over which the related services are rendered  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used for the determination of fair value under sfas and r for options granted to employees  with the exception that  for non employee options  we are required to use the remaining contractual term as the life of the option and the fair value related to unvested non employee options is re measured quarterly  based on the then current stock price as reflected on the nasdaq capital market 
recently adopted accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements but clarifies the fair value definition  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop assumptions for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level input  then to quoted prices in non active markets or in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  and inputs that are not directly observable  but that are corroborated by observable market data for the asset or liability level input  then the lowest priority to unobservable inputs  for example  the company s own data about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability level input 
it emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and a fair value measurement should therefore be based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis at least annually  which are deferred until fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in order to determine the implications of adopting sfas  the company reviewed all the assets and liabilities recorded on its balance sheet 
based on the results of its review  the company determined that a majority of its assets and liabilities are either not required to be measured at fair value in its financial statements  are outside the scope of sfas  or are subject to the deferred implementation provisions of fsp no 
therefore  the only assets and liabilities in the company s financial statements subject to sfas ie measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december  are the company s investment portfolio 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement allows entities to voluntarily to choose to measure many financial assets and liabilities as well as certain nonfinancial 
table of contents instruments that are similar to financial instruments collectively  eligible items at fair value the fair value option 
the election is made on instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we adopted sfas on january and did not make any elections for fair value accounting 
therefore  there was no material effect on our financial statements on the implementation of this standard 
effective january   we also adopted issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf  which was adopted by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board  or eitf  in june eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and recognized as expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed  unless the entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or the services to be rendered 
eitf is effective for the fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
there was no effect on our financial statements on the implementation of this standard 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  ratified eitf no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf also establishes the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint operating activities and payments between participants  as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures related to these arrangements 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and would be applied retrospectively as a change in accounting principle for collaborative arrangements existing at the effective date 
we do not anticipate that there will be a material effect on our financial statements on the adoption of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds maintained at major us financial institutions and our short term investments consist of corporate debt securities and commercial paper with original maturities of less than nine months 
as of december   there were no mortgage backed securities and no auction rate securities in the portfolio 
to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  we have limited the maturities of our investments to less than two years with an average maturity not to exceed one year 
the short term investments held as of december  are all scheduled to mature in less than months 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december
